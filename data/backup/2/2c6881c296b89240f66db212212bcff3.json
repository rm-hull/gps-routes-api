  "description": "This circular walk visits Giant Hill in Dorset where you will find the striking chalk hill figure of the Cerne Abbas Giant. The figure is somewhat mysterious with its age and origin open to debate. It is generally thought to have been created sometime in the 17th century though. The walk starts at the Cerne Abbas viewpoint where there is a car park and splendid views of the hill. You can also start the walk from just opposite the village hall where there is another car park. The walk then ascends Giant Hill with wonderful views of the giant and the beautiful surrounding countryside. As you descend back towards the village you will pass the ruined 10th century Cerne Abbey which is well worth a look. If you would like to extend your walk you could pick the Wessex Ridgeway which runs past the hill. You could follow it to the nearby Minterne Gardens where you will find beautiful landscaped gardens with waterfalls, lakes and streams.",

There's also a number of quaint cottages dating all the way back to the 15th century in the village. Near the centre there's also a nice little footpath running along the River Cerne and the Mill Stream. Head a few miles to the north west and you could visit the idyllic village of Evershot. The village has strong connections with Thomas Hardy and includes a noteworthy 16th century pub and walking trails to the nearby Melbury Park Estate. The Frome Valley Trail can also be picked up here and followed along the picturesque river to Maiden Newton and Dorchester. Just to the west is the neighbouring village of Sydling St Nicholas. It's a delightful place with thatched 18th century cottages on a chocolate box High Street, a noteworthy 15th century church and a fine centuries old pub. There's also nice walks along the pretty Sydling Water here."
