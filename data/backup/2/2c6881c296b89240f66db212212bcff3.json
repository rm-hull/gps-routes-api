  "description": "This circular walk visits Giant Hill in Dorset where you will find the striking chalk hill figure of the Cerne Abbas Giant. The figure is somewhat mysterious with its age and origin open to debate. It is generally thought to have been created sometime in the 17th century though. The walk starts at the Cerne Abbas viewpoint where there is a car park and splendid views of the hill. You can also start the walk from just opposite the village hall where there is another car park. The walk then ascends Giant Hill with wonderful views of the giant and the beautiful surrounding countryside. As you descend back towards the village you will pass the ruined 10th century Cerne Abbey which is well worth a look. If you would like to extend your walk you could pick the Wessex Ridgeway which runs past the hill. You could follow it to the nearby Minterne Gardens where you will find beautiful landscaped gardens with waterfalls, lakes and streams.",
