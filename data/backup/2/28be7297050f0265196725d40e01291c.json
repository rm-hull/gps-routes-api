  "description": "This walk in Wrexham visits the pretty Hanmer Mere. You can start the walk in the little village of Hanmer and then pick up a footpath heading south along the eastern side of the water. Despite being located in Wales it is considered part of the Shropshire lake district. The Maelor Way passes through the village, providing an opportunity for extending your walk. You could follow it east toward Bronington, Whitewell and Whitchurch. Heading west will take you to Penley and Overton.",

Here you'll find more of the meres that make up the popular Shropshire Lakes. Along the canal from Colemere there's also the Fenns, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve. The noteworthy reserve straddles the border between England and Wales. It is a significant site being one of the biggest and best raised bogs in Britain. The area is great for flora and fauna and also includes the old Ellesmere Canal. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Walks page."
