  "description": "This walk in Wrexham visits the pretty Hanmer Mere. You can start the walk in the little village of Hanmer and then pick up a footpath heading south along the eastern side of the water. Despite being located in Wales it is considered part of the Shropshire lake district. The Maelor Way passes through the village, providing an opportunity for extending your walk. You could follow it east toward Bronington, Whitewell and Whitchurch . Heading west will take you to Penley and Overton.",
