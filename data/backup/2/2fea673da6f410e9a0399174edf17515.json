  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Coopers Hill, site of the famous annual cheese rolling event. The area includes a number of woodland trails, lots of wildlife and nice views over the Gloucestershire countryside from the high points. You can start the walk from the car park, just of Green Street. Then head south to climb to the hill summit which stands at about 240 metres. You can then follow other trails towards High Brotheridge and Buckholt Woods before returning to the car park. See the video below for the full madness of the cheese rolling event!",
