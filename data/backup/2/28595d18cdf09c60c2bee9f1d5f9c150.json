  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around Carr Mill Dam on this easy walk in St Helens. The pretty lake is located on the north eastern fringes of the town and notable as Merseyside's largest body of inland water. It's a nice place for a waterside stroll with footpaths running along both sides of the water. The lake also attracts a large variety of water loving birds including Great Crested Grebe and Herons. You can park at the southern end of the lake on Garrswood Road where there is free parking. Here you'll also find a number of information boards telling you all about the flora and fauna at the lake. You can pick up the footpaths heading around the lake which includes some woodland sections and a bridge crossing at the northern end. It's about a 2 mile walk around the lake so it will probably take an hour or so at a leisurley pace.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area try our St Helens Walk which takes you along the old St Helens Canal through a section of the lovely Sankey Valley Park. For great views over the town head north and enjoy a climb to Billinge Hill. The hill summit stands at a height of 179 m (587 ft) commanding fine views towards Great Orme in Wales, Blackpool tower, Greater Manchester, Winter Hill and the Derbyshire Peak District. You can reach the hill on the Rainford Walk which starts from the nearby village. This walk also visits the pretty lakes in the Orrell Water Park. On the southern edge of the town there's Sutton Manor Park to explore. The popular park includes the iconic Dream Sculpture which is a local highlight and well worth seeing. There's also a great viewpoint and the adjacent Clock Face Country Park to visit here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Merseyside Walks page."
