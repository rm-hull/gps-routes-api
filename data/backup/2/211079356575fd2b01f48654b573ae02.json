    "description": "A circular walk from the village of Coalbrookdale exploring Shropshire's wonderful Ironbridge Gorge. The walk starts from the Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron which is located south west of Telford at postcode TF8 7DQ. The fascinating museum details the history of the area and features stunning exhibits, exquisite art castings and functional cookware all made from iron. From the museum you can pick up woodland trails heading south through the gorge to the town of Ironbridge on the River Severn. The historic town takes its name from, The Iron Bridge, a 100-foot (30 m) cast iron bridge that opened in 1781. The surrounding gorge, was formed by a glacial overflow from the long drained away Lake Lapworth, at the end of the last ice age. After exploring the town the route then follows the Severn Way footpath east along the river before picking up the Ironbridge Way . This waymarked trail will take you north through the gorge to Rough Park. There are some nice trails here heading west along the Rough Park Way back into Coalbrookdale.",
