  "description": "This circular walk in Staffordshire takes you around the beautiful Trentham Gardens and Trentham Lake. There's 300 acres of landscaped parkland, gardens and woodland to explore on a series of good footpaths. Features in the park include a Floral Labyrinth, Secret Garden, Japanese Garden and Italian Gardens. It's great for wildlife with a deer park, monkey forest and heronry by the large lake. There's also a lakeside boardwalk, a maze and a miniature railway to try. The estate is located just outside Stoke-on-Trent. You can use the google street view link below to virtually explore the estate! If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Trent and Mersey Canal just to the east of the estate. Just to the west you will find Swynnerton Old Park and Hanchurch Woods with miles of woodland walking trails and the pretty Hanchurch Pools. There's also some nice climbs to try on Hanchurch Hills with fantastic views over Cranborne Chase to the hills of Wales. The long distance Two Saints Way also passes the park. You could pick up the trail and follow it to the Trent and Mersey Canal .",
