  "description": "This circular walk in Staffordshire takes you around the beautiful Trentham Gardens and Trentham Lake. There's 300 acres of landscaped parkland, gardens and woodland to explore on a series of good footpaths. Features in the park include a Floral Labyrinth, Secret Garden, Japanese Garden and Italian Gardens. It's great for wildlife with a deer park, monkey forest and heronry by the large lake. There's also a lakeside boardwalk, a maze and a miniature railway to try. The estate is located just outside Stoke-on-Trent. You can use the google street view link below to virtually explore the estate! If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Trent and Mersey Canal just to the east of the estate. Just to the west you will find Swynnerton Old Park and Hanchurch Woods with miles of woodland walking trails and the pretty Hanchurch Pools. There's also some nice climbs to try on Hanchurch Hills with fantastic views over Cranborne Chase to the hills of Wales. The long distance Two Saints Way also passes the park. You could pick up the trail and follow it to the Trent and Mersey Canal .",

It's mostly on lead but you can keep them off leads in the area, located on the walk up towards North Park on the Estate. The on site cafes mentioned above are both dog friendly and will provide water bowls. There's also a dog washing facility at Trentham Shopping Village so your dog won't have to go home with muddy paws!"

      "content": "The Stone Walk visits the gardens from the nearby town by following the canal towpath to Trentham. On the way it passes the lovely Downs Banks, a National Trust property with some fine woodland trails to try. A few miles to the north west there's the attractive town of Newcastle Under Lyme where you'll find a number of lovely parks and gardens with trails along the Lyme Brook. The splendid university campus at Keele and the popular Apedale Country Park are also located near the town. Just to the east of Stoke there's some nice cycling and walking trails around Park Hall Country Park. The former quarry site is now notable as Stoke on Trent's only National Nature Reserve comprising woodland, heathland and ponds. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
