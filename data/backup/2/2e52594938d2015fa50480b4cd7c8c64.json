  "description": "A circular walk from Aldeburgh to Thorpeness, taking in the Suffolk Coast, the wonderful Thorpeness Meare and the North Warren RSPB reserve. Start from Aldeburgh at the Fort Green car park on the front. Then follow the path along the shingle beach north, passing The Haven and the Benjamin Britten Scallop sculpture before coming to Thorpeness. The route then takes you around the delightful Thorpeness Meare, the centrepiece of the village. It's a beautiful spot with nice paths to follow around the 60 acre lake. There's lots of little islands, shady coves, and pretty creeks with boats available for hire. The area is thought to have been inspired by the book 'Peter Pan' as the authour J.M. Barrie was a close of friend of the Thorpeness founder, Scottish barrister Glencairn Stuart Ogilvie. The Meare is a good place to stop for refreshments with a nice waterside cafe. After leaving the Meare you follow footpaths south across the North Warren RSPB reserve. It's another scenic spot with grazing marshes, reedbeds, heathland, woodland and a wide variety of wildlife to see. Look out for breeding bitterns, marsh harriers, woodlarks and nightingales. The final section skirts the edge of Aldeburgh Marshes before returning to the finish point back on the sea front car park. To extend your walking in the area you can further explore Aldeburgh Marshes and the River Alde on our Aldeburgh Walk .",
