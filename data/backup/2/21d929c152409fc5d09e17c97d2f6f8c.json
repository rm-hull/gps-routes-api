  "description": "This Lincolnshire based market town sits in a nice location for waterside walks on the banks of the Humber Estuary. It's also the start point of the epic Viking Way which begins in the town on the southern side of the Humber Bridge. The town itself is also worth exploring with several Georgian buildings and the popular Ropewalk - an interesting arts centre housed in the former rope factory. This walk takes you along the Humber foreshore walk from Barton Waterside to New Holland. There's great views over the water to Hull, several pretty lakes with sailboats and lots of wildlife to see along the way. The walk starts at the car park and viewpoint at Barton Waterside where there are fine views to the iconic Humber Bridge. From here you head east, crossing the footbridge over Barton Haven and continuing to the Water's Edge visitor centre and cafe. The centre is one of the highlights of the area with a country park, nature reserve and good range of facilities. The route continues east passing a series of sailing lakes before coming to Barrow Haven and New Holland. Here you have the option of catching the train back or returning on the same footpaths.",
