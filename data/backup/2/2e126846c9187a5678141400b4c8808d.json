  "description": "This walk takes you along the trackbed of the old\u00a0Hadleigh Railway line from Hadleigh to Raydon Wood railway station in Suffolk. It's a 2 mile stroll on flat paths which are also suitable for cyclists. The walk starts from the now closed Hadleigh railway station, in the centre of the ancient market town. The station was\u00a0the terminus of the\u00a0Hadleigh Railway, a short branch line from\u00a0Bentley Junction, which opened in 1847. The station building still stands and is in use as a private residence. The route heads south east along the old line, passing Raydon Great Wood before finishing at the old Raydon Wood railway station. There's a car park at this end of the route so you could also start from here if you prefer. To continue your walking in Hadleigh you could enjoy a stroll along the River Brett in the town centre. The path is located a few miles west of Ipswich where there's nice trails to try along the River Orwell and the River Gipping. The town is also located close to the Dedham Vale AONB where there's lovely walks around Constable country.",
