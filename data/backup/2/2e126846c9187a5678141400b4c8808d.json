  "description": "This walk takes you along the trackbed of the old Hadleigh Railway line from Hadleigh to Raydon Wood railway station in Suffolk. It's a 2 mile stroll on flat paths which are also suitable for cyclists. The walk starts from the now closed Hadleigh railway station, in the centre of the ancient market town. The station was the terminus of the Hadleigh Railway, a short branch line from Bentley Junction, which opened in 1847. The station building still stands and is in use as a private residence. The route heads south east along the old line, passing Raydon Great Wood before finishing at the old Raydon Wood railway station. There's a car park at this end of the route so you could also start from here if you prefer. To continue your walking in Hadleigh you could enjoy a stroll along the River Brett in the town centre. The path is located a few miles west of Ipswich where there's nice trails to try along the River Orwell and the River Gipping. The town is also located close to the Dedham Vale AONB where there's lovely walks around Constable country.",

It's one of the prettiest places in the county with medieval cottages, the famous Water Splash and a fine old timber framed pub. The circular Kersey Walk explores the countryside around the village and visits the little village of Lindsey on the way. To the south west there's Stoke By Nayland and Polstead to explore. Both are pretty villages with historic features such as a 15th century church and 17th century inn. Just a mile to the north east there's Wolves Wood to explore. The RSPB owned site includes some peaceful woodland trails, pretty ponds and lots of wildlife to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Suffolk Walks page."
