  "description": "This pretty Oxfordshire village lies just to the east of Sutton Courtenay on the River Thames. The riverside settlement is located on the epic Thames Path National Trail. The waymarked trail can be picked up on the southern side of the village next to Clifton Hampden Bridge. Clifton Hampden includes some delightful thatched cottages, a listed 19th century bridge, a fine 14th century pub and a noteworthy church with elements dating back to the 12th century. This circular walk from the village takes you to two of the local highlights at the Roman Town of Dorchester and the viewpoint at Wittenham Clumps. Start the walk in the village and follow the waymarked footpath east past Burcot to Little Wittenham Bridge. Cross the bridge and you can enter Dorchester where you can visit the 12th century abbey and its fascinating museum. The route then takes you to Wittenham Clumps where there are some peaceful woodland trails and the ancient Iron Age Hillfort on Castle Hill. The route then returns to Clifton Hampden via the little village of Long Wittenham, with some fine countryside views on the way.",
