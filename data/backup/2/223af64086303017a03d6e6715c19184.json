  "description": "This 450 acre park in Maidstone has a lovely lakeside cycling and walking track running through it, using National Cycle Network number 177. It's perfect for a safe family cycle ride or a short, peaceful stroll. In 2013 it was voted the nations third favourite park in the Green Flag People's Choice Awards. The park includes the former stately home Mote House, a miniature railway, a pitch and putt golf course, a BMX track and a boating lake with pedalo hire. The Medway Valley Walk runs near the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along the River Medway through Maidstone. If you're on a bike you could follow the Maidstone to Rochester cycle route to Rochester .",
