  "description": "This pretty little Hampshire based village is located in a lovely spot on the River Itchen near to Winchester. There's some pleasant riverside trails and the nearby Avington Park also provides excellent local walking opportunities. The village is also notable for providing the inspiration for the setting of Charles Kinglsey's novel The Water Babies. The author was a regular visitor to the area. This circular walk from the village takes you along the river to the nearby village of Easton before heading through the countryside to visit the picturesque Avington Park. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the Itchen Way and follow it west to Chilland and Martyr Worthy. Here you cross the river and head south to visit the pretty village of Easton. After exploring the village the route continues south along Chapel Lane before turning north east along a public footpath. This will take you up to Avington Park where there's some attractive woodland, a herd of Highland Cattle and a lovely lake. After leaving Avington you head north to cross the river and return to Itchen Abbas.",

      "content": "To extend your walking in the area you could continue south west along the Itchen Way to visit Winchester where you could try the Winchester Circular Walk and the Winchester River Walk. Here you can visit the lovely riverside Winnal Moors Nature Reserve where there are excellent wildlife watching opportunities. You can also climb to St Catherine's Hill for some fine views over the surrounding area. If you head east you can pick up the circular New Alresford Walk and explore the area around the town.  A few miles to the north you'll find some peaceful woodland trails in Micheldever Woods. The woods are particularly popular in the spring when there are carpets of bluebells to see. The St Swithun's Way passes through the village. The pilgrimage walk runs from Winchester to Farnham, visiting many interesting historical sites on the way. The Three Castles Path passes the village. This historically themed long distance trail will take you from Windsor Castle to Winchester Castle, visiting the ruined Odiham Castle on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
