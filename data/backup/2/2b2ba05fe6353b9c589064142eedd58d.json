  "description": "Explore the beautiful river Rhymney Valley on this circular walk through the county borough of Caerphilly. The route starts at the pretty Penallta Community Park and visits Caerphilly, Bedwas, Hengoed, Rudry and Machen. Here you will climb Machen Mountain (the highest point on the walk) where there are spectacular views of the Rhymney Valley, Cardiff and the Bristol Channel. The route also visits the 17th century Ruperra Castle ruins in Lower Machen and the peaceful woodland at the pretty Llwyn Celyn Forest. In this area you can pick up the Iron Bridge Circular Walk to explore the area further. Also of note is the delightful Parc Cwm Darran where you can enjoy peaceful woodland trails, lakeside paths and sunny wildflower meadows. You'll also pass near Cefn Onn Park which is also well worth a visit. The walk is waymarked with a green and white disc.",

The pub has a great terraced area where you can sit outside and enjoy fine views of the Rhymney Valley countryside. It's a lovely spot and can be found near the forest at a postcode of CF83 3EB. In the little village of Rudry you'll find the splendid Maen llwyd Inn. It's a pub of some note dating back over 400 years and housed in a former farmhouse of weathered grey stone. The inn includes a sundrenched terrace for summer and a spacious bright conservatory for cooler days. They have a great menu and can be found at postcode CF83 3EB."

      "content": "The Pontypridd Walk uses part of the trail and a section of the Taff Trail to create a circular walk around the town. It's a nice way of viewing the Taff Valley scenery from Mynydd Meio which stands above the town at a height of 322 m (1,056 ft). Just to the west of Pontypridd there's Barry Sidings Country Park at Trehafod. There's some popular woodland mountain bike trails and lovely walks along the park's streams and waterfalls. There's also good views of the River Rhonnda at the northern end of the park. Just to the north east of Rhymney you can pick up the circular Trefil Quarry Walk. There's some fine trails around the unusual landscape of the quarry with excellent views over the Sirhowy Valley and the mountains of the Brecon Beacons National Park. Trefil is also significant as the highest village in Wales."
