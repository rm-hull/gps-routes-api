  "description": "Explore the beautiful river Rhymney Valley on this circular walk through the county borough of Caerphilly. The route starts at the pretty Penallta Community Park and visits Caerphilly, Bedwas, Hengoed, Rudry and Machen. Here you will climb Machen Mountain (the highest point on the walk) where there are spectacular views of the Rhymney Valley, Cardiff and the Bristol Channel. The route also visits the 17th century Ruperra Castle ruins in Lower Machen and the peaceful woodland at the pretty Llwyn Celyn Forest . In this area you can pick up the Iron Bridge Circular Walk to explore the area further. Also of note is the delightful Parc Cwm Darran where you can enjoy peaceful woodland trails, lakeside paths and sunny wildflower meadows. You'll also pass near Cefn Onn Park which is also well worth a visit. The walk is waymarked with a green and white disc.",
