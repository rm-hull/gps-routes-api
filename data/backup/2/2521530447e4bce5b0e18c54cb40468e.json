The obelisk is a monument to William Shaw of Brocklesby .. the plaque reads 'This monument was erected by his many friends as a token of their regard and to mark the spot where William Smith, huntsman to the Earl of Yarborough fell on 11th April 1845. His gallant horsemanship and management of hounds in the kennel and in the field were unsurpassed. His horse falling over a small leap whilst Smith was cheering on his favourite hounds, he was thrown on his head and from the injuries he then received, he died on 16th April 1845 at the house of his friend Richard Nainby of this village esquire, by whom the site for this memorial was given on the 6th day of April 1861'"

A small shop was soon established which sold ice creams and general goods, the original ice cream machine being capable of making one pint of ice cream every 45 minutes. The Learys continued to make ice cream from goats milk during World War 2 and by the mid 1960s decided to forget about selling other stuff and concentrate on ice cream only, building a reputation locally as \"the famous Brigsley ice cream shop\". The business was sold in 2003 and a new revamped shop opened on 10th March 2004."
