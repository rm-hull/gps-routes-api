  "description": "This walk visits the Crow Point Lighthouse near the town of Braunton on the North Devon coast. Crow Point sits on the River Taw and Torridge estuary at the southern end of the wider Braunton Burrows Nature Reserve. It's a lovely place for a walk with salt marsh, sand dunes, boardwalks, beaches and splendid coastal views. You can start the walk from the public car park which is just a short walk from the lighthouse. Both the South West Coast Path and the Tarka Trail run past the Point. You could pick up these long distance trails to further explore the area. Heading east from the car park would take you to Horsey Island where there's some lovely views to the surrounding Devon countryside.",
