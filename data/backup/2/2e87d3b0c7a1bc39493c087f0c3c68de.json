      "caption": "During the last ice age, over 12,000 years ago, immense ice sheets advanced over the Burren and much of Ireland. These ice sheets functioned like colossal bulldozers, eroding the land's surface and transporting vast quantities of sand, gravel, and boulders over extensive distances. As the ice sheets melted, they deposited all the sediments and rocks they carried onto the land surface. These deposited rocks are known as glacial erratics. Large limestone erratic boulders are visible throughout the Burren. Additionally, we can find various rocks in the Burren that do not originate from this limestone landscape."
