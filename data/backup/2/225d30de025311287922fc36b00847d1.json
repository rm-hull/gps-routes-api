The one on the right is the Tawe on its way from Llyn-y-Fan Fawr to Swansea. A local map in the car park names the one on the left as the river Llynfell. This is where it ends after a very short run out from below Dan-yr-Ogof caves across the road. Curiously there is a whole different valley called Cwm Llynfell with a separate Nant Llynfell about 10km west of here, also starting in the national park."
