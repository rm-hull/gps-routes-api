The one on the right is the Tawe on its way from Llyn-y-Fan Fawr to Swansea. A local map in the car park names the one on the left as the river Llynfell. This is where it ends after a very short run out from below Dan-yr-Ogof caves across the road. Curiously there is a whole different valley called Cwm Llynfell with a separate Nant Llynfell about 10km west of here, also starting in the national park."

  "description": "This delightful 40-acre Victorian garden is perfect for a peaceful stroll. There are well laid out walking paths taking you through woodlands, meadows, wide lawns and along the River Tawe which runs through the park. Craig-y-Nos Country Park is located in the Brecon Beacons National Park so the surrounding scenery is spectacular. Within the park you will find the historic Craig-y-nos Castle surrounded by beautiful landscaped gardens and two pretty lakes which attract a wide variety of wildlife. There is also a visitor centre and tea room with benches and picnic areas. The park is located near Aberdare, Merthyr Tydfil and Swansea .",
