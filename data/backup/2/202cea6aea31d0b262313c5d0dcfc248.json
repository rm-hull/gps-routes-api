  "description": "This circular walk visits Constitution Hill and explores the area around the town of Aberystwyth in Ceredigion. It's a fantastic viewpoint with views over the town below, several of the Welsh Mountains and Cardigan Bay. At the hill summit you will find one of the world's largest camera obscuras, offering a bird's eye view of 1000 square miles of countryside and coast. The hill is a short climb from the centre of the town. After reaching the summit you continue to the woodland of Glanmor Fach before heading along the golf course and descending back into the town. The footpaths are generally good and there are really nice views for most of the way. On a clear day you can see the Pembroke Coast to the south and Snowdonia to the north. If you'd like to visit the hill without the climb then you could take the  funicular electric cliff railway which is the longest in Britain. The Abercyclefest also organises a downhill mountain bike race on the hill. See the video below for details! To continue your walking in the Aberystwyth area catch the Vale of Rheidol Steam Railway to the spectacular Devil's Bridge Falls. You can also pick up a lovely section of the Ceredigion Coast Path on our Aberystwyth to Borth Walk .",
