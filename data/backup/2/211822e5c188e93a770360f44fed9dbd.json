  "description": "This walk visits the Falls of Cruachan waterfall before heading to the nearby Cruachan Reservoir dam in\u00a0Argyll and Bute. You can start the walk from the Falls of Cruachan railway station on the West Highland Line at the foot of\u00a0Ben Cruachan. Trains depart from\u00a0Glasgow Queen Street and\u00a0Oban to the falls. You could also start from the Cruachan Dam visitor centre, just west of the train station. Here you can explore the Cruachan Power Station and learn all about its function and history. From the train station you can pick up footpaths heading north along the Allt Cruachan watercourse to the power station and the imposing reservoir dam. The hydroelectric dam\u00a0takes water between\u00a0Cruachan Reservoir\u00a0to nearby Loch Awe , a height difference of 396 metres (1,299\u00a0ft). For a fee you can explore the power station and see the huge machine hall and power-generating turbines located deep within Ben Cruachan mountain.",
