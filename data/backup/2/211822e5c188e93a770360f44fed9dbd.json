  "description": "This walk visits the Falls of Cruachan waterfall before heading to the nearby Cruachan Reservoir dam in Argyll and Bute. You can start the walk from the Falls of Cruachan railway station on the West Highland Line at the foot of Ben Cruachan. Trains depart from Glasgow Queen Street and Oban to the falls. You could also start from the Cruachan Dam visitor centre, just west of the train station. Here you can explore the Cruachan Power Station and learn all about its function and history. From the train station you can pick up footpaths heading north along the Allt Cruachan watercourse to the power station and the imposing reservoir dam. The hydroelectric dam takes water between Cruachan Reservoir to nearby Loch Awe, a height difference of 396 metres (1,299 ft). For a fee you can explore the power station and see the huge machine hall and power-generating turbines located deep within Ben Cruachan mountain.",
