  "description": "Enjoy a stroll around this National Trust owned 18th-century landscape garden in Bath. The main feature of the park is the lovely lake crossed with a stunning Palladian bridge. This type of bridge is extremley rare with only four of the same design in the world. Look out for wildlife including herons and swans on the lake. From the lakes you can stroll down through woodland to the meadows and ponds at the southern end of the park. In this area you can see dragonflies, cygnets and possibly roe deer. Other features in the park include a summerhouse, ice house and a beautiful cascade which feeds the lakes. The park is elevated high above the city so you can enjoy wonderful views over Bath from various viewpoints. The Bath Skyline Walk passes the park so you can easily pick up this wonderful six mile circular route around the city to extend your walk.",
