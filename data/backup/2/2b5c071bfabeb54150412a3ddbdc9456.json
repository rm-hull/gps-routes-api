  "description": "This attractive park overlooks the lovely coastline at Saltburn in Yorkshire. It contains beautiful formal gardens and woodland with fine views of the ocean. There is also a woodland centre, the Albert Memorial, waterside paths along the Skelton Beck, Victorian Gardens and Italian gardens. The epic Cleveland Way runs right through the park so it's easy to continue your walking if you have time. You could follow it south towards Skelton or east along the coast to Skinningrove on our Saltburn to Whitby Walk. You could also head north west along the coast on our Redcar to Saltburn Beach Walk which visits the nearby village of Marske-by-the-Sea.",
