  "description": "This fabulous country park in Carmarthenshire has miles of coastal cycling and walking paths to enjoy. You can follow National Cycle Route 4 along a super traffic free path which passes along the beautiful Loughor estuary and the Gower peninsula. The route takes you past Llanelli beach and Tywyn beach to Burry Port where you will find a pretty harbour, beach and the newest marina in Wales. You then head back east passing Sandy Water Park and Machynys beach before coming to the National Wetlands Centre where you can look out for a variety of birdlife. Look out for flocks of dunlin, ringed plover, sanderling and redshank along the coast whilst shelduck, oystercatcher and curlew can be seen further out on the mudflats. Other highlights in the park include the excellent Discovery Centre where you will find a wealth of information about the area in a fabulous modern building. If you would like to continue your outing you could head west along the coast to the fabulous Pembrey Country Park where you will find more lovely coastal scenery, woodland wildlife trails and bike hire from the Ski Pembrey centre.",

There's footpaths and a cycle path running along the two pretty reservoirs which are located near Swiss Valley. It's a peaceful spot with more lovely scenery to enjoy. Near here there's the town of Pontarddulais where you can start a walk up to the viewpoint on Graig Fawr. At the lake near Sandy you can pick up the Swiss Valley Cycle Route. The multi user trail runs along a disused railway path from the park to Tumble, passing the Swiss Valley Reservoir on the way. The Heart of Wales Line Trail starts/finishes at the park. The 143 mile trail explores the Heart of Wales Railway Line, a wonderful rural railway running between Swansea and Shrewsbury. The trail visit several train stations, old railway lines and photogenic railway viaducts. You can follow the trail east to visit Gorseinon and Pontarddulais."
