  "description": "This large Staffordshire based village is well positioned for picking up a number of waymarked footpaths which run through the surrounding countryside. Nearby there's also a historic old hall with attractive parkland and gardens to explore. This route from the town makes use of sections of the Monarch's Way and the Staffordshire Way to create a circular walk through the surrounding countryside and woodland. On the way you'll visit some of the highlights of the area including Wrottesley Hall and Chillington Hall . The walk starts from the train station on the western side of the town. From here you can pick up the Staffordshire Way and the Monarch's Way and follow the waymarked footpaths south west to visit Wrottesley Hall and Park. The route then retraces its steps to Oaken before heading west and then north to Codsall Wood. You then skirt the western edge of Chillington Park on another section of the Monarch's Way. The route then heads east along Brick Kiln lane which will take you to the entrance of Chillington Hall. The Georgian country house has some fine walks around the Capability Brown landscaped park and lake. It is only open on a select number of days each year but there are public footpaths around the estate. From the hall you head south past Gunstone to return to Codsall and the train station.",
