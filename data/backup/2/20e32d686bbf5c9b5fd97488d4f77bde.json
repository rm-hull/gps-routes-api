This was once the A45 (the principal Midlands - East Anglia route) and was a serious bottleneck, especially at the eastern end of the High Street where road negotiates a series of tight narrow bends. Today the road has been downgraded to the B645 (long-distance traffic is now routed via the A14, a few miles to the north) and as a result Kimbolton is a much more peaceful place. The attractive architecture, selection of small shops and pleasant pubs give the village an olde-world atmosphere."
