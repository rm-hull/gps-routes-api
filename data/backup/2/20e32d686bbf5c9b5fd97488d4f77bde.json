      "caption": "Looking along the High Street towards Kimbolton School. This was once the A45 (the principal Midlands - East Anglia route) and was a serious bottleneck, especially at the eastern end of the High Street where road negotiates a series of tight narrow bends. Today the road has been downgraded to the B645 (long-distance traffic is now routed via the A14, a few miles to the north) and as a result Kimbolton is a much more peaceful place. The attractive architecture, selection of small shops and pleasant pubs give the village an olde-world atmosphere."

  "description": "This Cambridgeshire based town has some nice country trails and significant local reservoir in the shape of Grafham Water which lies just to the east of the settlement. In the town there's also views of the River Kym and the historic Kimbolton Castle to visit. This circular walk explores the countryside to the west of the town around Kimbolton Park. On the way there's some nice trails around Honeywell Wood and good views from the viewpoints around Hungry Hill.",
