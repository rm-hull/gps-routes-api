  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Millstone Edge near Hathersage in the Peak District. The area is great for interesting geology and fabulous views over the surrounding peaks and countryside. You can start the walk from the Surprise view car park off the A1687. From here you can pick up trails heading west to the Surprise view viewpoint. The route then continues north along Millstone Edge. Here you can enjoy lots of pretty heather in the summer and fine views over Hathersage and the Hope Valley. The area also includes Master's Edge, a rock climbing route considered one of the hardest gritstone climbing routes in the world. The route then bends round to Over Owler Tor and Mother Cap where there are more splendid rock formations and huge millstones to see. To extend the walk head south from the car park to climb to Owler Tor. You can also explore the wonderful Padley Gorge Trail and the Longshaw Estate here.",
