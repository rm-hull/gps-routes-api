    "description": "This attractive Warwickshire based town is in a good location for exploring the North Cotswolds. The historic market town was known for its sheep market, playing a major part in the local wool trade. The town derives its name from the Olde English 'Sheep-wash-Town'. This walk from the town uses a section of the Warwickshire Centenary Way to visit the nearby villages of Honington and Idlicote. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it north east along the River Stour. The route turns north to visit the neighbouring village of Honington where you will find Honington Hall. This privately owned 17th century country house is Grade I listed. The River Stour flows past the village on the western side and has a noteworthy 5-arched 17th-century bridge crossing it. The local church has been re-built, but retains its 13th-century tower. After exploring the village and hall you continue to Idlicote. Here you'll find a number of pretty cottages and the Church of St James the Great which has features dating from the 13th century. There's also Idlicote House, a grade II listed country house, on a site once owned by St Mary's Abbey, Kenilworth. After exploring the village you can then return to Shipston on the same paths.",
