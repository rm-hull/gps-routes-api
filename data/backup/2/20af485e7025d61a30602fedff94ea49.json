  "description": "Visit this lovely beauty spot on the outskirts of Bradford on this easy circular walk in West Yorkshire. The area includes a peaceful wooded valley with two reservoirs and lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for. There's a car park at the eastern end of the woods, off Haworth Road. From here you can pick up nice woodland footpaths along a pretty beck to the two reservoirs. The site includes a wetland area with a series of ponds. Here you can look out for interesting flora and fauna such as freshwater shrimp, dragonflies, the common snail, frogs, toads, sticklebacks, and flowers such as purple loosestrife. Also look out for herons on the reservoirs and owls in the woodland area. The site is located just a few miles south of Shipley which is a great place to extend your walking. Here you will find the fascinating model village of Saltaire, waterside walks along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the wonderful Shipley Glen. A couple of miles to the south you can pick up the long distance Bronte Way and further explore Bronte Country.",
