  "description": "This small village in North Herefordshire sits in a pleasant rural location close to the Shropshire border. There's some nice trails along the two local rivers and some interesting historical sites in this former Roman settlement. This circular walk takes you along the river Clun to Jay Bridge, to the west of the village. It then follows country lanes through the surrounding countryside before passing through the village and paying a visit to the River Teme. On the way you'll visit the point where the two rivers converge and enjoy views of the historic Leintwardine Bridge which dates from the 18th century and spans the Teme. There's also a climb to Church Hill where you can enjoy fine views over the village and surrounding countryside.",
