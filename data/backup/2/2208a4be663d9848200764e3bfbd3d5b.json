  "description": "This small village in North Herefordshire sits in a pleasant rural location close to the Shropshire border. There's some nice trails along the two local rivers and some interesting historical sites in this former Roman settlement. This circular walk takes you along the river Clun to Jay Bridge, to the west of the village. It then follows country lanes through the surrounding countryside before passing through the village and paying a visit to the River Teme. On the way you'll visit the point where the two rivers converge and enjoy views of the historic Leintwardine Bridge which dates from the 18th century and spans the Teme. There's also a climb to Church Hill where you can enjoy fine views over the village and surrounding countryside.",

You can find them on Rosemary Lane at postcode SY7 0LP for your sat navs. There's also The Lion which serves high quality dishes from the restaurant. It's located close to the river with views of the old bridge, the Teme and the Welsh Marches from the wonderful lawned garden. You can find them at postcode SY7 0JZ."

There's more waterside trails along the Teme here, as well as a visit to the 11th century Ludlow Castle and Whitcliffe Common. Head south east of the village and you could visit something of a hidden gem at Downton Gorge. The limestone gorge is located on the River Teme and contains some nice woodland trails with interesting rock formations and a variety of flora and fauna. For more walking ideas in the area see the Herefordshire Walks page."
