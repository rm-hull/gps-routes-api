  "description": "The Northumberland town of Cramlington is located just to the north of Newcastle upon Tyne on the border between Northumberland and North Tyneside. The town has a few nice country parks and woodland areas to visit in the locality. This circular walk visits Plessey Woods Country Park to the north of the town. The route starts at the visitor centre and car park where you can pick up trails heading south through the park and the woods. You then head west along the River Blyth through Stannington Vale. The area is great for wildlife watching with a variety of woodland birds to look out for on the way.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area head east towards Bedlington where you can visit Bedlington Country Park and Humford Woods. Here you'll find the old Humford Mill and more riverside paths along the Blyth into the coastal town of Blyth. To the south west of the town is the village of Brunswick where you'll find the Big Waters Nature Reserve. There's some nice trails here including a raised boardwalk taking you to hides, pond and a feeding station. There's also the largest subsidence pond (one of the largest bodies of open water in the region), providing home to diverse wildlife. Just to the west of the town is another of the highlights of the area at Northumberlandia. Here you'll find a huge land sculpture in the shape of a reclining female figure, known as the Lady of the North. There's some nice trails to follow around the park which also includes a visitor centre. For more walks in the county see the Northumberland Walks page."
