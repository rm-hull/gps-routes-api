The town has a few nice country parks and woodland areas to visit in the locality. This circular walk visits Plessey Woods Country Park to the north of the town. The route starts at the visitor centre and car park where you can pick up trails heading south through the park and the woods. You then head west along the River Blyth through Stannington Vale. The area is great for wildlife watching with a variety of woodland birds to look out for on the way.",
