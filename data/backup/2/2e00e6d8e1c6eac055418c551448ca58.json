  "description": "Enjoy wonderful views over the Eden Valley on this climb to the summit of Hartley Fell in the North Pennines AONB. The walk starts from Kirkby Stephen and climbs to the 662 m (2,172 ft) summit on a mixture of country lanes and footpaths. You will pass a series of cairns about 10ft tall known as the Nine Standards. At the summit there is a trig point that marks the watershed divide across England. From here, rivers flow west toward the Irish Sea and east toward the North Sea. There are also wonderful views of Cross Fell , Great Dun Fell and the Howgills. The walk is on Wainwright's Coast to Coast walking route so you could pick this up to continue your walking in the area. To continue your walking in the area you can try our Kirkby Stephen Circular Walk and enjoy riverside paths along the River Eden.",
