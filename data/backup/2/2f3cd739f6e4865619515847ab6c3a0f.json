  "description": "Enjoy a stroll around this super nature reserve between Bristol and Gloucester . There are 120 acres to explore on good footpaths and boardwalks which pass over the lakes. The reserve boasts the largest collection of amphibians in the UK and the splendid Flamingo lagoon with the\u00a0UK\u2019s largest flock of flamingos. You can view the birds from a fantasic sunken observatory. There is a well equipped bird hide and a wonderful rain garden which featured at the Chelsea Flower Show. You can also climb the Sloane Observation Tower for fantastic views of the Cotswolds and the River Severn. The Gloucester and Sharpness Canal and the Severn Way pass the site so it's easy to continue your waterside walking in this lovely area. Our Frampton on Severn Canal Walk will take you to the site from the nearby village. It's about a 3 mile walk from the village along the nice towpath. The reserve is also a short walk from fascinating Purton Hulks . These abandoned boats and ships lie on the banks of the River Severn, just to the south west of Slimbridge.",
