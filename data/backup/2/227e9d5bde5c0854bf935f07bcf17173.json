  "description": "This walk visits a series of waterfalls just to the north of Hebden Bridge. Much of the area surrounding the site is private land so please stick to the public rights of way. You can start the walk from the parking area on Hebden Bridge Road just to the east of the falls at Gib Slack. From here you follow footpaths west for about half a mile to reach the falls at Crimsworth Dean Beck. Here you'll find the rushing falls next to Lumb Bridge. There's also a plaque to Ted Hughes poem 'Six young Men' which concerns a group of men photographed at the falls before they went to fight in the first World War. After admiring the falls you can follow paths running along the beck and through the peaceful woodland, before heading back to the parking area. To continue your walking in the area head to the nearby Hardcastle Crags which are located just to the west of the falls on the Haworth-Hebden Bridge Walk. The National Trust run area is home to tumbling streams, beautiful waterfalls and Gibson Mill.",

      "content": "If you head west to Harcastle Crags there's a nice on site cafe inside the picturesque Gibson Mill. Run by the National Trust it includes outdoor seating with nice views of the river. The historic mill was built in the 1800s as part of the industrial revolution. It was driven by a water wheel and produced cotton cloth up until 1890. The mill is totally self-sufficient with electricity created from the natural surroundings. If you fancy a pub lunch then the Robin Hood Inn is worth considering. The historic 17th century coaching inn has carvings of 2 men in Lincoln Green and is inscribed \u201cIf Robin Hood be not at home come take a pot with little John\u201d. They serve traditional pub food and a fine selection of ales. If the weather is good you can sit outside in the garden area and enjoy splendid views towards Stoodley Pike. In the colder months there's a cosy interior with with 2 log burning fires to keep you warm. The inn is located just to the south of the falls at Pecket Well with postcode HX7 8QR."
