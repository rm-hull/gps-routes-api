  "description": "This walk visits a series of waterfalls just to the north of Hebden Bridge . Much of the area surrounding the site is private land so please stick to the public rights of way. You can start the walk from the parking area on Hebden Bridge Road just to the east of the falls at Gib Slack. From here you follow footpaths west for about half a mile to reach the falls at Crimsworth Dean Beck. Here you'll find the rushing falls next to Lumb Bridge. There's also a plaque to Ted Hughes poem 'Six young Men' which concerns a group of men photographed at the falls before they went to fight in the first World War. After admiring the falls you can follow paths running along the beck and through the peaceful woodland, before heading back to the parking area. To continue your walking in the area head to the nearby Hardcastle Crags which are located just to the west of the falls on the Haworth-Hebden Bridge Walk . The National Trust run area is home to tumbling streams, beautiful waterfalls and Gibson Mill.",
