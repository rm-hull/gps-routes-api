  "description": "The market town of South Molton is located in a pleasant position in the Mole Valley. It is also close to Exmoor which is a fine place for walkers. This walk follows a footpath from South Molton to North Molton along the River Mole. The path can be picked up about a mile north of the town centre. It will take you north east through farmland and woodland with views of the River Mole valley to enjoy on the way. It's a pretty area which also includes 19th century woolen mills and country views.",
