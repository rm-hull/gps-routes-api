  "description": "Follow the Wilberforce Way from Hull to York on this walk created in memory of Hull's most famous son, William Wilberforce the Slave abolitionist. You start at the Deep Aquarium, on the River Humber in Hull and head north along the River Hull to Beverley, with its magnificent Minster. You then head west along a dismantled railway to Market Weighton and Londesborough Park where there's lovely grounds and a lake to see. You then continue onto Pocklington, where Wilberforce went to school. A waterside section along the Pocklington canal then takes you to Elvington before the final section from Wheldrake to York. This section passes Wheldrake Woods and the University of York before joining the River Ouse and finishing at York Minster. The walk is waymarked with a black and white disc.",

It's a nice place to stop for refreshments with cosy open fires indoors and a garden area to relax in on finer days. You can access the pub just to the south of the historic Grade II listed Church Bridge in the village of Melbourne. Postcode is YO42 4QJ. In the village of Wheldrake, near York, there's the Wenlock Arms to consider. The pub has an interesting history having been originally owned by Lord Wenlock when it provided a retreat for his tenants and workers within the area. They do very good food and also have a sunny beer garden if the weather is good. You can find them on Main Street at a postcode of YO19 6AA."

      "content": "In Pocklington we recommend a visit to the very pretty Burnby Hall Gardens. It's a lovely place for an afternoon stroll with landscaped gardens and two lakes. The park is notable for over 100 types of water lilies displayed in the lakes where you can also feed the fish. There's also an ornamental bridge, a Victorian Garden, an Aviary Garden, a newly restored Edwardian Rock Garden, a Stumpery, and a Birch Walk, the latter being the most recent horticultural addition. You can find out about the history of the area in the Stewart Museum. It houses a fascinating collection of artefacts collected by Major Stewart on eight world tours that were undertaken between 1906 and 1926, several of which have been deemed by UNESCO as being of national and international importance. Afterwards visit the cafe where you can enjoy refreshments with a view. You can find the park in the town centre with a postcode of YO42 2QF for your sat navs.  Burnby Hall - Victorian Gardens and Dragonfly Pond"
