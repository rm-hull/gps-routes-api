  "description": "Follow the Wilberforce Way from Hull to York on this walk created in memory of Hull's most famous son, William Wilberforce the Slave abolitionist. You start at the Deep Aquarium, on the River Humber in Hull and head north along the River Hull to Beverley, with its magnificent Minster. You then head west along a dismantled railway to Market Weighton and Londesborough Park where there's lovely grounds and a lake to see. You then continue onto Pocklington, where Wilberforce went to school. A waterside section along the Pocklington canal then takes you to Elvington before the final section from Wheldrake to York. This section passes Wheldrake Woods and the University of York before joining the River Ouse and finishing at York Minster. The walk is waymarked with a black and white disc.",
