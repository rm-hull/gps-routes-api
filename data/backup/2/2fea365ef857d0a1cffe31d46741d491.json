  "description": "This walk makes use of a section of the Pennine Way to take you along this series of pretty reservoirs in Calderdale. There's some splendid moorland scenery and waterside paths along the reservoirs. You start the walk from the Clough Foot car park and follow the Pennine Way to Walshaw Dean Lower Reservoir. The path continues along the middle reservoir and upper reservoir where you cross the Dam. You then return to the car park on the western side of the reservoirs. If you continue along the Pennine Way you will come to Top Withens. This ruined farmhouse is said to have been the inspiration for the location of the Earnshaw family house Wuthering Heights in the novel of the same name by Emily Bronte. It is located about a mile from the upper reservoir, just east of Withins Height below Delf Hill. The video below shows an alternative route from Top Withens to the reservoirs. The Gorple Reservoir and Widdop Reservoir walks also start from the same location so it's easy to extend your walking in the area.",
