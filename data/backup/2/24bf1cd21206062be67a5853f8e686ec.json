  "description": "This popular cycling and walking trail uses the Hayling Billy Coastal Path which runs along the west coast of Hayling Island near Havant. The trail gives fabulous views of Langstone Harbour which is an internationally important site for its wildfowl and wading birds. Also watch out for brent geese, oyster catchers and dunlin in winter. The route is very flat and entirely off road so is ideal for families looking for a safe traffic free cycle ride or for walkers looking for a pleasant waterside stroll. This route links nicely with the Portsea Island Explorer if you'd like to continue your outing. To further extend your walking try our Hayling Island Coastal Walk and explore the coast around the southern section of the island. You could also head west to Portsea Island and pick up the Solent Way and explore the coast around Portsmouth and Southsea, Gosport and Lee on Solent. The Shipwrights Way cycling and walking trail runs along the trail too. It can be followed all the way into Portsmouth in one direction or you can head north up on to the South Downs to visit Queen Elizabeth Forest Park and Alice Holt Forest .",
