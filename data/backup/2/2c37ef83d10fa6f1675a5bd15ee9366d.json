  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the beautiful Gwent Levels near Newport. The reserve covers 1,080 acres of the Caldicot Levels attracting a wide variety of wildlife. These include Cetti's warblers, Bearded Tits, Little Egrets and Little Grebes. There are well laid out footpaths taking you to ponds, reedbeds, grassland, lagoons and along the lovely Severn Estuary. On the Orchid walk you can look out for beautiful plants and flowers. The RSPB facilities are very good with a visitor\u00a0centre, picnic areas, play areas and cafe. The section along the estuary and past the Usk Power Station is part of the National Cycle Network so you can bring your bike too! It's a lovely traffic free ride, passing the 19th century East Usk Lighthouse with views of the River Usk. The reserve is located just a few miles south of Newport town centre. You can park at the reserve if coming by car or you could follow National Cycle Network Route 4 and other local cycle routes to the reserve.",
