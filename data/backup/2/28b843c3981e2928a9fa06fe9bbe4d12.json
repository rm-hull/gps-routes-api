  "description": "This circular walk takes you to the Llyn Stwlan Reservoir Dam near Tanygrisiau in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. On the route you will also be exposed to a number of photogenic slate mines which dominate the landscape in this scenic area. The walk starts from the Tanygrisiau rail station on the heritage Ffestiniog Railway railway. From here you can follow trails south west along the lovely Tanygrisiau Reservoir before coming to the Power Station on the western side of the lake. Here you can link up with the Llyn Stwlan Mine Railway Walk and follow it west to the Stwlan Dam. The dam is an impressive sight and part of the Ffestiniog Power Station, a pumped-storage hydroelectricity scheme. The trail continues west past the lake to the Moelfryn Quarry before heading north east to take you past Moel-yr-Hydd where there are some wonderful views back down to the lake. You'll then round the Wrsygan Slate Quarry before turning south to follow trails back to Tanygrisiau.",
