  "description": "Follow the walking trails around this fascinating and beautiful island off the Pembrokeshire coast, near Tenby. You can catch a boat from Tenby Harbour to the island. A short stroll from the jetty takes you to the attractive monastery, village green and pretty cottages of the inhabitants. There is also the fascinating Old Priory and two medieval churches to explore. Caldey is one of the Holy Islands of Britain and has a history stretching back 1500 years. There are good footpaths to follow to the south of the island where you will find a lighthouse and wonderful views of the Pembrokeshire Coast. There is also a lovely beach at Priory bay on the north of the island. Caldey is also rich in interesting flora and fauna. The country's largest colony of cormorants is located at St Margaret's Island at the western end of Caldey. It is also covered in pretty, rare flowers.",
