  "description": "This small village sits in a lovely position in the Ullswater\u00a0Valley, near the southern tip of the same named lake. It makes a good base for exploring the lake and many of the surrounding fells. This circular walk from the village visits three of the lovely lakes including Angle Tarn , Hayeswater and Brothers Water . The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths south east up to Boredale Hause and Stony Rigg. You then come to the Angletarn Pikes and Angle Tarn. It's a beautiful spot with fine views to Ullswater Lake and the surrounding fells. From the tarn you continue south east towards Satura Crag and the Knott, passing Rest Dodd on the way. The path then descends to Hayeswater Lake. From the lake you can pick up the Hayeswater Gill and follow it north east towards the little village of Hartsop. At Hartsop it is a short stroll to Brothers Water. It's another delightful, peaceful spot with a circular trail around the small lake. From Brothers Water you then head north to follow footpaths back into Patterdale.",
