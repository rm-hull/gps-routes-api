  "description": "This Cheshire based town sits in a nice spot next to the canalised section of the River Weaver. It also includes a number of pretty lakes (or flashes) that show evidence of the town's salt mining history. This waterside walk from the town follows the Weaver Way to neighbouring Northwich along the canal. It's a nice easy walk with pretty locks and good views of the surrounding countryside on the way. The route starts on the eastern side of the town at Weaver Parkway, just north of the picturesque Bottoms Flash Reservoir. The parkway is a good sized green space on the outskirts of the town. There's nice trails along the river and lots of wildlife to look out for too. You can park for free at the Rangers\u2019 Office here and then pick up a shared walking and cycling path running north along the Weaver Navigation. The trail will take you past Moulton, Meadowbank Salt Mine and Eaton Bank Woods before coming to the Valeroyal locks. The route then heads north east through Kingsmead and Northwich before finishing at Carey Park to the north of the town.",
