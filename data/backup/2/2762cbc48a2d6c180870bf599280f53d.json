    "description": "This Cotswolds village is located in a rural spot just to the east of Stroud . This walk from the village takes you to the peaceful woodland trails in Standish Wood before climbing to the viewpoint at Haresfield Beacon . The route uses a section of the Cotswold Way National Trail which can be picked up just to the east of the village and the train station. The trail will take you north past Doverow Hill, Westrip and Randwick before entering Standish Wood where there's bluebells in the spring and evidence of Bronze Age settlements. From here you can head a short distance north to Haresfield Beacon where there's an Iron Age Hillfort and wonderful views over the Severn Vale. Towards the end of the route there's also a pleasant waterside stretch along the Stroud Canal which runs just to the south of the settlement.",
