  "description": "This popular circular walk takes you from Dovedale to Milldale using sections of the Tissington Trail and Limestone Way to take you on a tour of this popular area of the Peak District. It's just under 10 miles and includes riverside paths, woodland sections and some moderate hill climbs. The walk starts in the little village of Tissington where parking is available. It's a popular and picturesque place with pretty little cottages and a village pond. From Tissington you can pick up a section of the Limestone Way and follow it south west to Thorpe, passing Tissington Hall on the way. The 17th-century Jacobean mansion is Grade II* listed and includes pretty garden terraces and a stable block. It is open to the public at certain times of the year. From Thorpe you head west to St Mary's Bridge on the River Dove, where you pick up a riverside footpath heading north towards Thorpe Cloud and the photogenic Dovedale Stepping Stones. The delightful valley is one of the most popular places in the national park with its distinctive limestone scenery, fascinating caves and diverse plant life. You continue north past Bunster Hill, the Dove Hole Caves and the striking Ilam Rock before coming to Milldale. Here you turn east away from the river, towards Alsop en le Dale, where you pick up the Tissington Trail. The shared cycling and walking trail will take you south east back to the village and the finish point. On the open sections of the trail there are seats where you can enjoy fine views of the surrounding Derbyshire countryside. If you enjoy this walk then you could try our Ilam Circular Walk which is of a similar length and level of difficulty. It starts from the National Trust's Ilam Park car park and visits the Manifold Valley and the River Hamps.",
