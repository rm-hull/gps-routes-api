    "description": "This Gloucestershire based village sits in a beautiful spot in the Forest of Dean. It's great for exploring on foot with miles of woodland trails, riverside paths, local hill climbs and a significant historic site all nearby. This circular walk from the village visits Tintern Old Station, the historic Tintern Abbey and the splendid viewpoint at the Devil's Pulpit. The walk starts in the village and crosses the bridge over the River Wye to pick up the Wye Valley Walk. Follow the waymarked walk south and you will soon come to Tintern Old Station. The old rail station has been converted into a park with three old rail carriages used as a gift shop and a museum with old railway memorabilia. There's also some pleasant footpaths to follow around the site. The route then continues around the river bend to visit the nearby abbey. The ruins of this 12th century monastery are a fine place for a stroll, with views of the river and the surrounding woodland of the Forest of Dean. After exploring the abbey retrace your steps along the river to the old footbridge where you can cross over the water. Head south east and the route will take you up to the Devil's Pulpit. There are excellent views over the Wye Valley AONB from this popular elevated spot. You then head north east past Caswell Woods to return to Brockweir.",
