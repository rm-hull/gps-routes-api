  "description": "Climb to the summit of Deadwater Fell in Kielder Forest and enjoy wonderful views over Northumberland and Scotland. The 1900 feet (571 metres)\u00a0fell sits on the England-Scotland border about 2.5 miles north of Kielder. You can start the walk from Kielder Castle and follow footpaths through woodland and across open moorland to the hill summit. From here there are great views towards the Lake District, the Pentland Hills near Edinburgh and the North Sea coast. This route is for walkers but there is also a good mountain bike trail which you can follow all the way to the summit. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could try the Kielder Forest Lakeside Way and enjoy views across Kielder Water.",
