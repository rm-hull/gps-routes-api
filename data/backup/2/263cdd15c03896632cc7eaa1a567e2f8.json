  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the pretty Anglesey village of Rhoscolyn. The village is located south of Holyhead and is notable as the most southerly settlement on the island. For walkers there's a fine cliff top path with interesting geological features and excellent views to enjoy throughout. There's also lots of wildlife to see with grey seals in the water and stonechat, whitethroat and wheatear to look out for in the air. The walk starts in the village and follows a footpath west to Tywrideen before turning south west to Rhoscolyn Head. You then pick up the Anglesey Coast Path and follow it south east past the mediaeval St Gwenfaen's Well to Borthwen. There's great views over the Llyn Peninsula from the dramatic rocky coast path. There's also lots of coves, two striking natural arches and views to the nearby Ynysoedd Gwylanod (seagull\u2019s islands) and Rhoscolyn Beacon. From the attractive sandy Borthwen beach it is then just a short walk back to the village.",
