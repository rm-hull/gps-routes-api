  "description": "Enjoy a lovely riverside walk along the River Nidd, from Knaresborough Castle to the nearby Conyngham Hall. The walk runs for just under two miles, starting from the ruins of the 12th century Knaresborough Castle. The 12th century castle sits in a fine location, next to the river, just south of the train station. For a fee you can explore the interior of the castle and visit the interesting museum which details the history of the castle. The grounds include pretty gardens, attractive lawns, a bowling green and a putting green are free to access. From the castle's elevated position there are also fine views over the surrounding area. From the castle head north and then west along the river until you come to High Bridge. Cross to the other side and you can follow footpaths through the woodland on the southern side of the water. After the river bends round to the north you will come to a footbridge where you can cross to Conyngham Hall. There's nice trails to follow around the hall's open parkland, woodland and gardens. After exploring the hall grounds the route then follows the northern side of the river back to the castle. To extend the walk continue along the river into the wonderful Nidd Gorge . The gorge is a hugely popular walk and includes the impressive Nidd Viaduct and huge variety of wildlife to look out for. You could also head south east along the river on the Knaresborough Round long distance trail. Heading in this direction will take you to Goldsborough where you could explore the beautiful gardens at the 16th century Goldsborough Hall.",
