  "description": "A popular walk from Studland to Swanage along a lovely section of the South West Coast Path. The walk runs along a good waymarked path for about 4 miles, with some moderate climbing along the way. At the end of the walk you can return the same way or catch the open top bus back to Studland. The walk starts from the car park at South Beach in Studland and follows a nice grassy path up to Old Harry Rocks. The three striking chalk formations mark the most easterly point of the Jurassic Coast. The rocks are thought to be named after Harry Paye, the infamous Poole pirate. His ship would lay in wait for passing merchant ships, using the rocks as cover. You then follow the path up to Ballard Point where you can pick up the Purbeck Way to take you up onto Ballard Down. From here you can enjoy fabulous views over Poole Harbour, the Isle of Wight and down to the town of Swanage below. From here you can pick up a footpath descending towards Swanage. The South West Coast Path follows some minor roads to the town but you also have the option of dropping down to the beach and following the sands into the town. To extend the walk you could continue along the coast path up to Durlston Country Park. There's more great views and lots of interesting flora and fauna to see here.",
