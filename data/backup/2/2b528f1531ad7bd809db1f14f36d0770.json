  "description": "This spectacular park in Shropshire covers 100 acres and includes intricate pathways, ravines, arches, bridges, towering cliffs and follies. There are magnificent views of the surrounding Shropshire countryside from the clifftops, a series of atmospheric caves to explore, the remains of the ruined Red Castle and the delightful Hawk Lake. The video below shows the fabulous scenery you can expect to see on your walk. The park is located about 8 miles north of Shrewsbury. To continue your walking in the area you could try our Shrewsbury River Walk and enjoy riverside trails and a visit to the lovely Quarry Park. The National Trust owned Attingham Park is another great place for a walk. Here you'll find orchards, resident deer, a beautiful Walled Garden and the River Tern.",
