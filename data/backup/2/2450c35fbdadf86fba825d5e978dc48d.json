  "description": "This walk visits the Buchanty Spout waterfall on the River Almond near Crieff in Perth and Kinross. There is a public car park near the falls and a short walking trail. At the impressive falls you can see the leaping salmon during late summer and autumn. It's a fine spot, particularly after heavy rain. You can continue your walking in the area by heading into Crieff to try Lady Mary's Walk .",
