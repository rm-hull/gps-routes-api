  "description": "This circular walk around Chislehurst takes you to some of the highlights of the area. You'll visit Chislehurst Common, the National Trust's Petts Wood and the pretty Scadbury Park. The route uses various public footpaths and a section of the waymarked 7 London Loop to explore the area. The route starts on Chislehurst Common where there are some nice woodland trails to follow across the public open space. Follow the paths south across the common and they will take you past Hawkwood House and over the Kyd Wood to Petts Wood. Here you pick up the London Loop to follow it east through the woods though you could take a small detour south to visit Jubilee Country Park. The woods are good for wildlife spotting with a variety of woodland birds to look out for. The peaceful estate is run by the National Trust and covers 338 acres. After passing through the woods you follow the London Loop north and then east to visit Scadbury Park. The park is also a nature reserve which includes 300 acres of ancient woodland, grassland and ponds. There's also the ruins of the historic Scadbury Manor where playwright Christopher Marlowe stayed in the late 16th century. From the park footpaths then head west past Icehouse Wood before heading through the town to return to the war memorial on the common.",
