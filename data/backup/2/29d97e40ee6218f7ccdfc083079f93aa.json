  "description": "Enjoy a stroll around these beautiful gardens in Buxton. The park covers 23 acres with plenty of nice walking trails to keep you busy for an hour or so. In the park you'll find shrubbery, trees, streams and a lake with ducks and geese. Other attractions include a miniature railway, an excellent cafe and a botanical conservatory with plants from around the world. At the weekends there is likely to be an event such as antique markets, local artists and brass bands to see. If you'd like to extend your walk you could head to the nearby Poole's Cavern and Buxton Country Park which is less than a mile away. Here you can enjoy a climb to the Victorian folly of Solomon's Temple and enjoy some wonderful views over the town.",
