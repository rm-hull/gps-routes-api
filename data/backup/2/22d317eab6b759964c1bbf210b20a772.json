    "description": "This is a splendid walk along canals and through wonderful Shropshire and Cheshire countryside from Grindley Brook, near Whitchurch, to Mow Cop near Congleton . The walk starts on the Shropshire Union Canal at Grindley Brook and heads to Marbury. Here you'll pass the tranquil Marbury Meres, known as Big Mere and Little Mere. The larger Comber Mere is just to the east, slightly off the route. The next stage takes you towards Wrenbury and then onto Coole Pilate where you cross the Shropshire Union Canal. The path continues passing Weston and Haslington before joining the Trent and Mersey Canal at Malkin's Bank for some waterside walking. At Thurlwood you leave the canal and head towards Little Moreton Hall . Owned by the National Trust the hall is a moated 16th-century half-timbered manor house. The final section then takes you onto the finish point at Mow Cop finishing near the castle.",
