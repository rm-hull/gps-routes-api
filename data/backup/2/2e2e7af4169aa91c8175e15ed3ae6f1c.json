  "description": "Climb to Lonscale Fell from Keswick on this lovely walk in the Lake District. From the 715 m (2,346 ft) summit there are splendid views over Thirlmere and Derwentwater. It's a nice climb which you can start from the centre of Keswick. The route follows the Cumbria Way long distance footpath out of the town, climbing through the woodland of Whinny Brow to Ewe How. You continue on to Lonscale Fell, passing Latrigg, Whit Beck and Lonscale Crags on the way. The route leaves the Cumbria Way on Lonscale Crags and heads towards the hill summit. It's a nice, fairly short climb on good footpaths with wonderful views over many of the major fell groups. There's lots of good options for extending your walking in the area. You could climb to Latrigg or visit the fascinating ancient stones at Castlerigg Stone Circle. At Whit Beck you could turn north west and up Skiddaw Little Man to Skiddaw. A similar climb to this one can be found at Great Wood with the climb to Walla Crag .",
