  "description": "This attractive village in Bedfordshire is home to English Heritage's Wrest Park . The estate provided the village with a number of its historic features including the St James's church, the old school and a row of picturesque almhouses. This circular walk around the village takes you through the countryside surrounding the impressive Wrest Park . You'll also visit the Silsoe Nature Reserve and Park on the southern side of the settlement. The walk starts in the village and heads east, skirting the edge of Wrest Park. There's some beautiful 'Capability' Brown landscaped gardens and a series of canals in this 92 acre park. You continue south along bridge tracks to Higham Gobion before turning north to Fielden Court. The trail then heads through Buckle Grove Wood before entering the Silsoe Nature Reserve and Park. There's some nice easy footpaths here with ponds and wildlife to see. You can also pick up a footpath heading south west from here to Pulloxhill if you would like to extend the walk.",
