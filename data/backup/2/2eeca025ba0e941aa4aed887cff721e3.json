  "description": "Climb to the highest point in North Yorkshire on this challenging circular walk in the Yorkshire Dales. Whernside is one of the Yorkshire Three Peaks, with the others being Ingleborough and Pen y ghent. The route runs for a distance of just under 8 miles with a steep ascent and descent, meaning a good level of fitness is required. The circular walk begins at Ribblehead and heads to the Blue Clay Ridge via the magnificent Ribblehead Viaduct. You continue your ascent passing the pretty Little Dale Beck and Force Gill where you can see a series of waterfalls. The route then passes Knoutberry Hull and a small tarn before arriving at the 736 m (2,415 ft) Whernside summit. From here there are fantastic views over the Yorkshire Dales, the Lake District and Morecambe Bay. From the summit you descend to Broadrake before crossing the lovely Winterscales Beck. You then follow the beck to Gunnerfleet Farm, and on to the finish point at Ribblehead. To extend your walking in the area you could try our easy circular walk around the magnificent Ribblehead Viaduct. The Grade II* listed structure is one of the England's greatest monuments to Victorian engineering. The long distance Dales Way and Ribble Way both pass near to the mountain so you could pick up these splendid trails to further explore the area.",

There's a good menu and you can also book rooms for the night. Just up the road to the west you'll find the Old Hill Inn (LA6 3AR). This pub dates all the way back to 1615 and is another popular spot for walkers exploring the Dales."
