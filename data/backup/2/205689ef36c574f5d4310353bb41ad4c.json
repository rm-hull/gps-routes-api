The house survived for just over 100 years although nothing of Smythson's Hall now remains above ground. It was apparently replaced by a more ordinary looking house until 1820 when Sir Robert Sheffield sold up the family's remaining properties in London and had the present house designed and built by Robert Smirke, the architect of the British Museum."
