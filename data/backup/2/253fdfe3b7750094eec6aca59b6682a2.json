  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside surrounding the Chilterns village of Turville. The walk makes use of the Shakespeare's Way and Chiltern Way waymarked trails to create the loop. It's a 13 mile route but can be cut down to about 8 miles without the excursion to Stonor Park and the Warburg Nature Reserve. There are some moderate climbs along the way, with the route reaching a high point of just over 600ft. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Chiltern Way and follow it east past Turville Windmill and Turville Hill, where there are nice views back down to the village. You continue through Fingest Wood to Skirmett , Pheasant's Hill and the village of Hambledon. The village includes a noteworthy church which dates from the 14th century and includes a conspicuous memorial to Cope D'Oyley (who died in 1633) and his family.\u00a0The post office in the village serves also as the local shop and cafe, so it's a good point in the walk to stop for refreshments. At Hambledon you pick up the Shakespeare's Way and follow it north west through woodland and countryside to Southend. You then head west to Stonor Park which has a public footpath running through Balham Wood and to the south of the house. The fine country house was probably begun after 1280 when Sir Richard Stoner (1250\u20131314) married his second wife, Margaret Harnhull. The house has a 12th-century private chapel and the remains of a prehistoric stone circle are also in the grounds. It is open to the public on certain days and includes  The Chilterns Pit Stop Cafe and a\u00a0Visitor Centre. After passing the park you continue west to visit Warburg Nature Reserve . The reserve is a lovely place for a stroll with lots of bluebells and wood anemones in the spring. In the summer months the site is rich with orchids including fly orchid and bird's-nest orchid. After exploring the reserve the route heads east to return to Turville, via Stonor Park and Southend. To continue your walking in the area you could head north west and visit Christmas Common and Watlington Hill . It's a popular area with walkers, with nice beech woodlands and the prospect of spotting red kites flying above the hills. Our Hambleden Walk will take you south to visit Hambleden Mill and lock on the nearby River Thames.",
