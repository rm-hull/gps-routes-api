  "description": "This walk follows a lovely section of the John Muir Way long distance trail, from Dunbar to North Berwick. There's nice coastal stretches and some East Lothian countryside to enjoy on the way. The route runs for just over 15 miles with some moderate climbs along the way. The walk starts on the front in Dunbar and follows the coast west to Belhaven Bay and John Muir Country Park. The route continues west through the countryside to East Linton, with views of the River Tyne on the way. At East Linton you turn north, passing the Howden Burn and the ruins of Waughton Castle which dates from the 14th century. The next stage climbs toward North Berwick Law which overlooks the East Lothian town of North Berwick and stands at 613 ft (187 m) above sea level. The summit bears remnants of an Iron Age hill fort, and the ruins of later military buildings that were once used by lookouts in both the Napoleonic Wars, and in World War II. The hill top provides a stunning view over the Firth of Forth and the nearby Bass Rock island. After taking in the views from the hill summit the route then descends into the town of North Berwick. To extend your walk you can visit the interesting mid-14th-century Tantallon Castle, just to the east of the town. There's a nice path running along the coast with views of Milsey Bay. You could also pick up the John Muir Way and head west toward Dirleton and Gullane on the Gullane to North Berwick Walk. Our circular Dunbar Cliff Walk will take you along part of the path with fine views of the ruined Dunbar Castle and Bass Rock.",

This easy 5 mile walk takes you along a dismantled railway line, running between these two East Lothian Towns. Just to the south of Dunbar you can enjoy a walk up to the Dunbar Bear. The large bear sculpture celebrates the life of the locally born John Muir, known as the father of national parks"
