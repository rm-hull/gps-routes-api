  "description": "This circular walk from Sutton Cheney Wharf takes you along the Ashby Canal and through the surrounding woodland and countryside. It's a lovely place for a stroll with the easy towpath trails and the site of a historic battlefield to visit nearby. You start off at the car park at Sutton Wharf next to the bridge and the canal. You then follow a section of the Leicestershire Round north west along the canal and through Ambion Wood toward Ambion Hill. Near here you can visit the Bosworth Battlefield site. This field is the site of the last significant battle of the Wars of the Roses, the civil war that took place in the 15th century. The route then bends round to the east to visit Sutton Cheney village. From the village you follow footpaths south to Harper's Hill before heading west to Stapleton Lane. Near here you can then rejoin the canal and follow it north back to the car park.",
