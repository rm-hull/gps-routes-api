    "description": "Explore the fascinating ruins of this 13th century castle and enjoy lovely views over the River Dee estuary on this interesting circular walk in North Wales. The castle was the first of a series of castles built during King Edward I's campaign to conquer Wales. It's a very picturesque area with the striking castle sat next to the pretty estuary. The views over the estuary to England and the Wirral are also splendid. There is a car park next to the castle or you could walk up from the nearby Flint railway station. There are good walking paths along the Wales Coast Path which runs past the site to Flint Marsh. You could extend your walk by continuing along this long distance path towards Holywell or Connah's Quay. Also nearby is the River Dee footpath into Chester in England.",
