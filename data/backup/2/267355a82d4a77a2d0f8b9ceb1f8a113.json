The business closed due to advancements in technology and the mill was initially sold to a private buyer, but was eventually bought by the Lincolnshire County Council."

The town is noted for the splendid Alford Manor House, a 13th century church and the five sailed Alford Windmill. This circular walk from the town takes you east to the neighbouring village of Bilsby. It also passes the Alford Windmill, a local tourist attraction. The walk starts in the town centre near the market place and church. You can follow country lanes east through the countryside to Bilsby where there's a noteworthy 15 century church to see. The walk then returns to Alford on a footpath heading west. This passes close to the windmill which has been restored to working order, and grinds grain to organic flour. From here it is a short stroll back into the town centre.",

The town is located not far from the coast where you can visit the popular towns of Skegness, Chapel St Leonards and Mablethorpe. This pleasant town has a lovely promenade and some attractive coastal gardens to visit. To the west there's the worthy village of Donington on Bain. Here you'll find a 12th century church, a fine 18th century pub and nice views of the River Bain. Near here there's also Binbrook, Biscathorpe and East Wykeham where there are the sites of two deserted medieval villages to explore. A few miles to the south there's the noteworthy Gunby Hall. The historic hall is one of the area highlights with 8 acres of beautiful gardens, an 18th century manor and an expansive country estate to explore.
