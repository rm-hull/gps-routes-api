Purchased by Harry Hoyles, a local farmer and land owner, in the early 20th Century, the business of milling and baking continued until the mid 1950s, run by his sons Walter, Arthur and Winston (The Miller). The business closed due to advancements in technology and the mill was initially sold to a private buyer, but was eventually bought by the Lincolnshire County Council."

  "description": "This small market town is located in a lovely spot on the edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds AONB. The town is noted for the splendid Alford Manor House, a 13th century church and the five sailed Alford Windmill. This circular walk from the town takes you east to the neighbouring village of Bilsby. It also passes the Alford Windmill, a local tourist attraction. The walk starts in the town centre near the market place and church. You can follow country lanes east through the countryside to Bilsby where there's a noteworthy 15 century church to see. The walk then returns to Alford on a footpath heading west. This passes close to the windmill which has been restored to working order, and grinds grain to organic flour. From here it is a short stroll back into the town centre.",
