  "description": "This walk climbs to Hawkley Hanger and Noar Hill in the Hampshire Hangers. The walk starts from the Hawkley Inn in the village of Hawkley. This fine pub serves high quality food and is popular with walkers and cyclists. From here you can pick up the Hangers Way and follow the waymarked trail to the Hanger. Keep going north along the trail and it will take you along woodland paths to Noar Hill. Here you will find a delightful nature reserve noted for its wildflowers and butterfly species. You could extend the walk by continuing north to Selborne Common where there's one of the highest points in the county. For an alternative circular walk in the area see the video below. This will take you to Shoulder of Mutton Hill, Happersnaper Hanger and the Poets Stone - a memorial to local poet Edward Thomas who lost his life in the First World War.",
