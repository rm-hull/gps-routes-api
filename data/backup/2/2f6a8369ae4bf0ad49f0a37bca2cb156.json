A double sunset can sometimes be seen against Chrome Hill from the southern flank of Parkhouse Hill; and also from nearby Glutton Bridge, on the upper valley of the River Dove, which is more easily accessible. The phenomenon is visible from Glutton Bridge in good weather for a short period around the summer solstice, when the sun sets just to the southwest of the summit of Chrome Hill, begins to re-emerge almost immediately afterwards from its steep northeastern slope before fully reappearing and later sets for a second and final time at the foot of the hill."

    "description": "This circular walk climbs the beautiful Chrome Hill in the Upper Dove valley area of the Peak District. You will visit the Chrome and Parkhouse Hills SSSI, an area with fascinating geology and limestone flora. It is also known as the Dragon's Back ridge. The walk starts from the little village of Earl Sterndale near Buxton . The village is a popular start point for walks because of its proximity to Dovedale , High Wheeldon , Parkhouse Hill and Chrome Hill. There is also an old pub called the Quiet Woman where you can find refreshments at the end of your walk. From Earl Sterndale you follow footpaths to Parkhouse Hill. The distinctive hill sits just to the north of the River Dove and stands at a height of 360 m (1,180 ft). You continue the ascent to the higher Chrome Hill which stands at 425 m (1394 ft). There are wonderful views over the Dove Valley towards the surrounding Peak District Hills. The walk then descends to Tor Rock and then through Dowel Dale on a nice country lane. You then pick up another footpath to Glutton Grange and Glutton Dale, before returning to Earl Sterndale. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to Buxton and climb to Solomon's Temple in Buxton Country Park . The Dane Valley Way long distance walk also runs through Buxton.",
