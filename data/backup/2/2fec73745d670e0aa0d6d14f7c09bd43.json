  "description": "This coastal walk takes you from the town of Stonehaven to the dramatic ruins of Dunnottar Castle. It's about a 1.5 mile walk following the coast path. The walk starts at the Stonehaven Harbour car park, about a mile south east of the train station. From here you can pick up the signed trail heading south past Downie Point to Strathlethan Bay where there are a series of waterfalls. You then pass Bowdun Head and Castle Haven before coming to the castle. The photogenic ruin sits in a wonderful position on the cliff top with wonderful coastal views from the fortress. The 15th century castle has a fascinating history being known as the place where the Honours of Scotland, the Scottish crown jewels, were hidden from Oliver Cromwell's invading army in the 17th century. Full access to the castle requires a fee with more details on the link below.",
