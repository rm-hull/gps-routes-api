Grain was found in a number of the pits, which are unusually large at 6 to 8 feet in diameter and typically 6 feet deep. For a good guide to the hillfort, see \u0091Worlebury.

  "description": "These pretty woods in Weston-Super-Mare have a series of good footpaths to try. The woods are also a local nature reserve covering 130 hectares (321 acres) on Worlebury Hill above the town. From the elevated position of the woods there are nice views over Sand Bay towards Wales. \u00a0There's also an Iron Age hillfort at the western tip of the site where the defensive ramparts can be clearly seen. You can park at the car park on Worlebury Hill Road at the eastern tip of the woods. Then pick up the trails heading west towards the coast. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the West Mendip Way long distance path and explore the Mendip Hills from Weston-Super-Mare. Just to the north of the woods you will find the splendid Sand Point where you can enjoy fine views across the Bristol Channel on a beautiful coastal peninsula. Just to the south you can enjoy more great coastal views on Brean Down or climb to the nearby Bleadon Hill .",
