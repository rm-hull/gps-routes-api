  "description": "This walk explores the Oxfordshire village of Kirtlington visiting the Kirtlington Quarry Nature Reserve, the River Cherwell and the Oxford Canal Walk. The quarry is located just north west of the village and is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The site dates to the Upper Bathonian, around 166 million years ago with several species of extinct mammal having been found. There are also fossils of theropod dinosaurs, crocodilians, pterosaurs, fishes and many shark teeth. Starting on the South Green in the village you can pick up the Oxfordshire Way and follow it west along Mill Lane to the quarry. You can follow footpaths around the fascinating site with some splendid views over the surrounding countryside from the high points. After exploring the quarry head west and you can pick up the canal towpath and enjoy an easy waterside stroll. The walk also passes Kirklington Park where there's a Grade I, 18th-century Palladian mansion set in 3,000 acres of parkland designed by Capability Brown, with views to the Chiltern Hills. The return leg includes a detour which follows a public footpath north east across the estate. You can also pick up the Palladian Way here. The long distance trail runs through the counties of Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire and is named after Andre Palladio's Italian architecture.",

The stone 19th century inn has a charming interior with a large wood-burning stove and church candles on pine tables. Outside there's a lovely courtyard area and a kitchen garden where they grow their own produce. They serve good quality food and have a car parking area. You can find them on Troy Lane at postcode OX5 3HA for your sat navs. The pub is dog friendly. Next to the green there's the Dashwood Arms which dates from the early eighteenth century and operates as a hotel."
