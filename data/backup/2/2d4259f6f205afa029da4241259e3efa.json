  "description": "This walk visits the Victorian manor house of Wightwick Manor in Wolverhampton. The Manor and its gardens are accessible to the public and have been owned by the National Trust since 1937. The grounds are a lovely place for a stroll with orchards, pools, formal gardens and a Victorian kitchen garden to explore. You can also tour the house where you will find a fine collection of paintings and ceramics. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal runs just to the south of the grounds. You could pick up the towpath and enjoy an easy waterside walk into Wolverhampton via the wildlife rich Smestow Valley Local Nature Reserve. You can link up with the South Staffordshire Railway Walk in this area too. Heading south would take you towards Wombourne where you could pick up the Wombourne Railway Walk. The Pattingham Walk will take you to the house from the village to the west.",
