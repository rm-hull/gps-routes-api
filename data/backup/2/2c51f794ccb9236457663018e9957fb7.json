In 1976 the Nottingham Canal Society was formed with the aim of restoring the canal for navigation between Langley Mill and Trowell. Broxtowe Borough Council originally supported this objective, but since then open cast mining has made this unrealistic, and the lengths in Council ownership are managed for nature and as a public amenity."

  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle along this pretty canal in Nottingham. The route runs along the Erewash Valley Trail from Langley Mill to the outskirts of Nottingham. It's a nice flat ride which is ideal for families. The route starts at Langley Mill and heads south to Cossall and Trowell. This area has now been declared as a nature reserve which attracts lots of dragonflies, damselflies and birdlife. On the Trowell section are the remains of Swansea bridge, one of the original stone bridges, which was built around 1793\u201395. From here you can see the original stone built lock keepers cottages. The route finishes very close to Wollaton Park where you can extend your outing. The large country park consists of an exquisite Elizabethan mansion surrounded by acres of parkland, woodland, lakes, formal gardens and the deer park. The video below shows the Erewash Valley Trail which includes this section along the Nottingham Canal.",
