  "description": "This walk takes you along Slapton Sands and the Slapton Ley National Nature Reserve in Devon. The lagoon at Slapton Ley is the largest natural freshwater lake in South West England. It's a beautiful area with the lovely shingle beach and the ocean on one side and the stunning lake on the other. There are a number of walking trails taking you through the reserve, including a family trail which takes about 45 minutes.  You can also easily continue to the nearby village of Slapton. The reserve is fantastic for wildlife with a number of bird hides around the lake. Look out for Cetti's warbler, Swallows, Badgers and Otters as you make your way through the reserve. For cyclists there is a super coastal road taking you past the lake and Slapton sands. The South West Coast Path runs past the site so there is scope for continuing your walk along the coast towards Dartmouth or Salcombe. If you head west you can visit Start Point where you can look out for seals and basking sharks before enjoying an interesting tour of the lighthouse. See the Torcross to Beesands and Start Point Walk page for more details.",
