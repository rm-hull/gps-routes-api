  "description": "A walk from Chepstow through the Wye Valley to the wonderful Tintern Abbey. It's about a 5 mile walk from the town to the abbey, passing through peaceful woodland with lovely river views. The route takes place on good waymarked footpaths, with some moderate climbing around Wyndcliff. From the high points there are great views over the surrounding countryside of England and Wales. Starting in Chepstow, the walk heads north along the river to Wyndlciff Wood, passing Chepstow Racecourse and Piercefield Park on the way. You continue north through Blackcliff Wood to Tintern where you can visit the fascinating ruins of the 12th century abbey. It's a very special area with the atmospheric ruins and the river flanked by the attractive woodland of the Forest of Dean. To continue your walking in the area you try our Severn Bridge Walk which crosses from Wales into England over the famous suspension bridge. This walk uses a section of the Wye Valley Walk long distance trail. You could continue north along the trail to visit Cleddon and Llandogo.",

      "content": "Just north east of Tintern you could visit the interesting village of St Briavels. Here you will find the historic St Briavels Castle which dates back to the 12th century and is open to the public under the care of English Heritage. The village can be accessed by crossing the Bigsweir Bridge over the Wye from Llandogo in Wales to St Briavels in England on the other side. In Llandogo you can enjoy a walk to the pretty Cleddon Falls on the River Cleddon. Near here there's Brockweir where there is easy access to Tintern Old Station where you can learn all about the history of the local railway. The Wye Valley Greenway runs from Sedbury to Tintern. The shared cycling and walking trail follows a disused railway line, notably passing through the murky Tidenham Tunnel on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Wye Valley Walks page."
