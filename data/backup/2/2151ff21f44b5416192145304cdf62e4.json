Although the church we see today is a 1846 rebuild, the original church was built in the 14th century. It is also believed that a small church occupied this site before 1174."

It contains a series of symbolic images representing easily recognisable features of the town. A coble is prominent overlooked by a puffin which stands on the Point rocks with a lifebelt to hand. St. Bartholomew\u0092s Church is also prominently represented with the Coble Inn itself and Bertorelli\u0092s Cafe Riviera sign, which has, sadly, now disappeared. The lifeboat station is featured together with simple images representing the Couple, the horseshoe steps and the old breakwater. The whole panel is held together with subtle colours which reflect the outlook of the settlement."

  "description": "This interesting town in Northumberland has some nice coastal trails along the local beach and bay. There's also an eye catching 13th century church and a noteworthy pub dating back to the 17th century. This circular walk from the town takes you along Newbiggin Beach and Bay before following a section of the England Coast Path north to the scenic Newbiggin Point, Beacon Point and Newbiggin Moor. On the way you'll also pass the golf course and the Alcan Aluminium Lagoon. To continue your walking in the immediate area head just a mile west to visit Queen Elizabeth II Country Park. Here you'll find nice footpaths around a pretty lake with woodland, grassland and a miniature railway too.",
