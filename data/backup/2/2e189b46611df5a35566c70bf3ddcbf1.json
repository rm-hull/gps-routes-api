  "description": "This super, large park in Sunderland has a number of cycling and walking trails and interesting environmental sculptures. There is also a boating lake, a nature pond and a sculpture trail. The park is ideal for an easy family cycle ride. The Great North Forest Heritage Trail runs through the park so you could continue your cycle/walk along this route. Also of interest is the Penshaw Monument just to the north of the park. This folly is situated on Penshaw Hill and dedicated to John George Lambton, first Earl of Durham. The video below shows the splendid views from this iconic landmark which appears on the badge of Sunderland Football Club. The riverside James Steel Park in Washington can also be visited in this area.",
