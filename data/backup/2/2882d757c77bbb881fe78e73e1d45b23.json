  "description": "This market town in Somerset sits on the edge of the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Local walking highlights include the climb to the Wellington Monument which lies just to the south of the town. The distinctive landmark commemorates the Duke of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo, commanding fine views over the countryside. The town also sits on the edge of the Brendon Hills where you'll find streams, rivers, rolling hills, wooded valleys and great views towards the nearby Exmoor National Park. Just to the north of the town there's also two long distance trails to pick up in the shape of the Grand Western Canal and the West Deane Way. These waymarked trails are an excellent way of exploring the surrounding countryside on foot. This circular walk makes use of these trails to visit the neighbouring villages of Langford Budville and Nynehead. On the way you will pass close to the noteworthy Nynehead Court. The Grade II listed house dates back to the 14th century and includes impressive landscaped gardens. There's also great views of the surrounding countryside and a visit to a splendid inn that dates back to the 1600s.",

Outside there's also a fine courtyard garden to relax in. They serve an excellent Sunday roast and provide rooms and car parking. You can find them in Langford Budville at postcode TA21 0QZ."

The signed Sustrans route starts on the Cornish coast at Land's End and takes you through Devon and Somerset before arriving at Bristol. Much of it is on quiet country lanes so also suitable for walkers."
