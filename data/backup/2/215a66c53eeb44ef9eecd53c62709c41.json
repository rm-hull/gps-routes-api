    "description": "These splendid gardens in Monmouthshire were built around 1895 but then buried just after WW2. They were rediscovered in 2000 and since then they have been beautifully restored. There are rock gardens, herbaceous borders, pretty  ponds and a wonderful labyrinth of underground grottoes, tunnels and sunken ferneries. The walk below takes you through the 7 acre gardens before heading into adjacent woodland where you can extend your walk along a variety of paths and tracks.",
