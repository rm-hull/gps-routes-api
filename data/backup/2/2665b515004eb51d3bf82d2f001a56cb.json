  "description": "This Warwickshire based village is located in a pleasant rural spot on the Stratford Upon Avon Canal. Lowsonford is known for its fine canalside pub and a series of locks along an attractive part of the canal. This circular walk from the village takes you along both the Stratford Canal and the Grand Union Canal Walk which runs just to the east of the settlement. The route first takes you north to Kingswood, passing a number of pretty locks on the way. Near here you could take a detour from the route to visit the historic Baddesley Clinton with its fine moated manor House. At Kingswood you can join with the Grand Union Canal and follow it south towards Turner's Green and Rowington. At this point you can pick up the Heart of England Way long distance footpath and follow it west to return to Lowsonford. The Henley in Arden Circular Walk passes the village. You could pick up the trail to visit the historic town with its medieval timber walled buildings on a splendid High Street.",
