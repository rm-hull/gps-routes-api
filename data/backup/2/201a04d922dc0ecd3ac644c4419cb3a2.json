  "description": "Ketteringham Hall is located in the Norfolk village of Ketteringham, a few miles south west of Norwich. The hall is generally not open to the public but there are bluebell walk days in May where you can explore the beautiful grounds and gardens. Here you can enjoy the Victorian walled gardens, peaceful woodland, wide lawns and the pretty lake that surround the Grade II listed mansion. There is also the tea room which gives access to the grounds during their opening hours. See the link below in the pubs/cafes section for more details. There's also public footpaths running up to the hall from the village, taking you through woodland to St Peter's church. These can be accessed all year round and provide a view of the entrance to the estate. In the winter you can see snowdrops in the woods and bluebells in the spring. There's also some lovely surrounding countryside to enjoy here as well. You can continue your walking by picking up the Tas Valley Way . Head east and you could visit Swardeston and Mulbarton with its pretty village green and historic church. The Hethersett and Swardeston Country Walk can also be picked up in this area.",
