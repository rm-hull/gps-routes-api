      "caption": "Rising Universe (Shelley Fountain). Percy Bysshe Shelley was born in Horsham at Field Place on August 4th 1792. In 1892, while the world\u0092s press celebrated the centenary of his birth, the only recognition given to Shelley by Horsham was a plaque placed in Horsham\u0092s parish church. However, by 1992 there were many events celebrating Shelley\u0092s Bicentenary in Horsham and Warnham, and it was resolved to mark his contribution to art and culture in a permanent and tangible way. Sculptor Angela Conner produced a bold and imaginative sculpture which vividly conveys the modern non-conformist nature of Horsham's famous poet. This strikingly modern sculpture is an apt symbol for a man greatly admired for his revolutionary and visionary ideas. The globe section of the sculpture fills with water which brings it down the central column - then, as has been caught in this picture, the water is released and the globe rises back up the column."
