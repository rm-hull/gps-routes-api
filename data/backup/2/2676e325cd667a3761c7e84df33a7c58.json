  "description": "Explore the four former slate mining valleys of Nantlle, Gwyrfai, Padarn and Ogwen on this beautiful walk through Gwynedd. The walk runs from Penygroes to Bethesda passing along the edge of the Snowdonia National Park along the way. Highlights on the walk include the 13th century, Dolbadarn Castle which features one of the finest surviving examples of a Welsh round tower. You will also pass between Llyn Peris and Llyn Padarn in Snowdonia. These glacially formed lakes are overlooked by Elidir Fawr mountain, with the busy village of Llanberis located on the southern shore of Llyn Padarn. The beautiful Marchlyn Mawr reservoir can also be found in this area. The walk is waymarked with a green and white disc. The area's quarrying history can be further explored on the Snowdonia Slate Trail which can be picked up in Bethesda.",

It runs mostly along old railway paths and the River Ogwen. The route is also suitable for walkers. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
