  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Rame Peninsula on the Cornish Coast. It's a fantastic place for a walk with wonderful views across Cawsand Bay to Plymouth Sound and the city of Plymouth. There's some nice coastal woodland and a visit to the mediaevel Rame Chapel. It's a great place for wildlife spotting with lots of sea birds and Dartmoor Ponies to look out for. The entire area of the peninsula is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The walk starts from the car park at Kingsand and follows the South West Coast Path to Penlee Point, before heading to Rame Head and the mediaevel chapel. You then head north along the coast before crossing the peninsula to return to Kingsand.",
