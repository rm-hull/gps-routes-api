  "description": "Starting at Cold Ashton in St Catherine's Valley, Gloucestershire follow the Limestone Link from the Cotswolds to the Mendip Hills in Somerset. The walk first heads south towards Batheaston where you join the River Avon and the Kennet and Avon Canal for a lovely waterside stretch to Monkton Coombe. You will also pass near to Little Solsbury Hill, made famous by the Peter Gabriel song 'Solsbury Hill'. The second section of the path then takes you through the Mendip Hills with fabulous views of the Chew Valley, Burrington Combe limestone gorge, Dolebury Warren Iron Age Hill Fort, the waterfall at Hallatrow and the final stretch through Burrington common the main highlights.",

      "content": "In Midford we recommend stopping off at the noteworthy Cross Keys. The pub has an interesting history, dating all the way back to the early 1700s when it began as a coaching house. There's an attractive interior with log fires in the winter and a large beer garden outside in the summer. They have a great menu and are also very dog friendly with water and treats provided for your canine friend. It's also a great place for walkers with many local walking groups that start and end their walks at the inn. You can find the inn just west of the Coombe Down Tunnel at a postcode of BA2 5RZ for your sat navs. In Monkton Combe there's the Wheelwright's Arms. The building dates back to the 18th century and includes a noteworthy large garden which can seat up to 140 people. They serve a fine Sunday lunch and also provide accommodation if you need to stay over. You can find them on Church Lane with postcode BA2 7HB for your sat navs."

In Somerset the route passes close to a number of pretty lakes including Chew Valley Lake, Litton Reservoir and Blagdon Lake. These are all worth a small detour from the route."
