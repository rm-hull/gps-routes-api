It was designed by James Wyatt, 1768-73, begun when he was only 22 and yet to acquire the flair which distinguished the rest of his career, making it his first known commission. Originally it was built in Totternhoe stone, but partly renewed in Bath stone during C20th restoration. Grade II* listed. The date of the photo is uncertain."

In the absence of any names on any maps, or any obvious history on the internet, I have called this Broadwater Lake after the nearby nursery. Given that water levels in the River Gade in this upstream reach very close to its source can fluctuate quite markedly over short spells of time, this was probably a man-made impoundment, created by the road bridge, to try to maintain some water in the river. The lake is about 180 metres long and about 40 metres wide at its maximum width."
