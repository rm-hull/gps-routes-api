    "description": "This walk takes you from Cardiff Bay to the seafront at Penarth . It runs for about 2.5 miles with nice views of the bay, Cardiff Barrage and Penarth Flats. The walk starts from Cardiff Bay station in Butewtown, just to the south of the city centre. You can then follow a footpath south past the Roath Basin where there are lots of new housing development around the marina. The path also passes the noteworthy Queen Alexandra Dock. At its peak, the port was one of the largest dock systems in the world. The route then passes the impressive Cardiff Barrage that impounds the Rivers Taff and Ely to create a massive fresh-water lake across to Penarth Head. The route then heads through Penarth, passing Penarth Head before finishing on the sea front. Here you can enjoy a stroll on the pier and enjoy some refreshments in one of the many pubs and cafes. You could extend the walk by continuing along the coast path before heading inland to visit Cosmeston Lakes Country Park . There's some nice waterside trails to follow around the two pretty lakes here.",
