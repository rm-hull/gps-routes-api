The three-wire fence is substantial enough to prevent access by commoners' ponies and cattle, whilst allowing the more nimble and slender deer to get in and out easily."

  "description": "This is a short walk in the New Forest taking you around the Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary. Here you will find a large herd of fallow deer with a viewing platform overlooking the meadow where the deer congregate.  The deer are fed daily by the Forestry Commission keeper so it's highly likely you will see a large number of deer in the early afternoon.  There is a good sized car park right next to the sanctuary and a number of graded walks taking you through the surrounding woodland.  There is also a large lawn area, picnic tables and an information cabin. The sanctuary is located about 4 miles west of Lyndhurst and about 6 miles east of Ringwood. To extend your walking in the area you could follow our Lyndhurst Circular Walk and visit the Knightwood Oak. The tree is over 500 years old and the largest oak tree in the New Forest.",
