  "description": "This Cornish town has some fine local hill climbs and riverside walks to try. To the north there's the Kit Hill, a country park with some great views over the Tamar Valley. Another local walking highlight is the splendid Cotehele House. The Tudor house has nice footpaths taking you around the extensive grounds. This walk from the village takes you to Cadson Bury Hill Fort. The ancient fort lies just to the south of the town and commands some fine views over the area. The route starts in the town and heads south to Pencrebar and Newbridge where you can follow a footpath up to the hill top. There's an Iron Age Hill fort here with excellent views over the countryside of the River Lynher Valley below.",
