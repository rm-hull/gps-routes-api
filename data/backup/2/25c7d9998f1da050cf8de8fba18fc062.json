  "description": "This short circular walk visits Cowm Reservoir in the Whitworth area of Rossendale. The reservoir was created with nearby Spring Mill Reservoir to augment Rochdale's water supplies during the 19th century. Today it makes for a scenic walk with fine views across the water to the surrounding moorland scenery. The walk starts from the car park at the southern end of the water. From here you can pick up a circular trail heading around the reservoir where you can look out for sailboats from the The Water Ski Academy.",
