    "description": "This interesting town is located near Loughborough in the Charnwood area of Leicestershire. This walk from the town visits two of the highights of the area at Blackbrook Reservoir and the historic Mount St Bernard Abbey . The walk starts in the town and follows path south to White Horse Wood and Blackbrook Reservoir where there are fine views across the water. You cross the southern end of the water passing Moult Hill and Drybook Wood before coming to Mount St Bernard Abbey . The abbey dates from 1835 and is notable as the first permanent monastery to be founded in England since the Reformation. The abbey monks are also known for brewing \"Tynt Meadow\" the only Trappist beer in Britain. Near the abbey you could extend the walk by heading to another local historic landmark at the 13th century Grace Dieu Priory . The anicent ruins of the priory are surrounded by some pleasant woodland with trails along the Grace Dieu brook. After exploring the abbey the route returns to the village on the same paths.",
