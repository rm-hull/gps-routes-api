  "description": "This walk takes you through the beautiful Wye Valley in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Wales. The walk begins on the mouth of the River Wye at Chepstow Castle in Monmouthshire and follows the River Wye north to Monmouth, passing the fascinating ruins of Tintern Abbey on the way. You continue through Ross on Wye to Hereford and then onto Hay on Wye. You then return to Wales and head to Builth Wells, Newbridge and Rhayader before the final stretch takes you towards the source of the Wye on the slopes of Plynlimon mountain in the Cambrian Mountains of Powys. There's plenty of spectacular mountainous scenery as you pass through the Wye Valley AONB, with several waterside sections along the River Wye to enjoy. You'll also pass the mysterious King Arthur's Cave and the splendid Symonds Yat Rock where there are fine woodland trails and wonderful views over the Wye Valley gorge. The walk is well waymarked with a white disc featuring a leaping salmon.",
