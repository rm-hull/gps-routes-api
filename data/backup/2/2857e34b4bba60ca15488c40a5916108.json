Along the way there's lovely beaches, interesting geology and some excellent coastal views to enjoy. You can start the walk from the car park at Sandyhills Bay where there is a lovely beach. The route then heads south west to Torrs Hill and the Needles Eye Natural Arch. There are fine views over the bay from the top of the hill. You continue past Portling Bay, Brandy Cove, Port O' Warren Bay, Lagmuck Sands and Castle Point before coming to Rockcliffe. This National Trust owned area includes, beaches, wildflowers and wonderful views to Rough Island and across the Solway Firth.
