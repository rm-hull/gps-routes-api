The neighbouring Magpie mine (SK1669) is visible on the far left of shot and in their heyday the proximity of the two operations often led to disputes over the prized veins of lead ore. Roof falls, fires and floods were also common occurances. Recent excavations of the abandoned mine shafts uncovered some more unexplained sightings - read Barbara Wadd's 'Ghost Walks in Derbyshire' for more tales..."

  "description": "This walk visits the Magpie Mine from the Derbyshire village of Sheldon. The trail exposes you to the interesting industrial heritage of the area. There's also some fine views of the surrounding White Peak limestone countryside from the photogenic site. You can start the walk in Sheldon village and follow footpaths south to visit the mines. The walled site includes a series of well preserved Lead Mines which date back to the 1600s. The mine closed in 1958 but has been recently restored for visitor access. It is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a popular place for a stroll. Sheldon is very close to the popular and beautiful Monsal Dale. Just head north and you can enjoy wonderful views from Monsal Head and pick up the Monsal Trail .",
