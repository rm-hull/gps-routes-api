  "description": "A short cycle and walking route along a dismantled railway line from Spennymoor to Bishop Auckland. This is a nice, easy route ideal for families. In Spennymoor you could stop off at Whitworth Hall Country Park and enjoy afternoon tea at the old country house. There's also lovely parkland and gardens to explore with a large herd of deer you can hand feed. In Bishop Auckland there's some nice riverside trails along the Wear.",
