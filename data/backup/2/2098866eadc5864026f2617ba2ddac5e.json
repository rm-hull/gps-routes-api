A glance at the map suggests that the Nebit belongs to the ridge that runs down off Craighorn, but it is actually connected to Ben Ever as the Glenwinnel Burn has crossed the ridge through capturing the burn that once flowed down the Silver Glen. The Silver Glen now has a misfit stream with its headwaters cut off. Silver was mined at one time in this area."

    "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Alva Glen in the Clackmannanshire town of Alva, in the Central Lowlands of Scotland. The route follows the Alva burn north from the town, taking you past pretty waterfalls with fine views of the surrounding Ochil Hills . You can start from the Alva Glen car park and then pick up the steadily rising footpath through the scenic gorge. Towards the end there are some splendid views back down the glen as you rise to over 200 metres. On the way you can also enjoy some lovely flora and fauna with pretty widflowers  and a variety of tree species. Wildlife includes kestrel, the long tailed wagtail and various other woodland birds. There's also the Alva Glen illuminations when the trail and the waterfalls are beautifully lit up with different coloured lights. To continue your walking in the area head south east to visit Gartmorn Dam Country Park . There's a fine waterside path around the Gartmorn Dam reservoir to enjoy here.",
