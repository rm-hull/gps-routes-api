    "description": "This delightful village in the North York Moors is a splendid place for a stroll. There's lots of nice cottages, sheep roaming freely around, the pretty Hutton Beck and the Ryedale Folk Museum . The fascinating museum is one of the highlights of the area. It includes several rescued and reconstructed historic buildings, including an Iron Age round house, period shops, thatched cottages, an Elizabethan manor house, barns and workshops. This circular walk takes you through the countryside surrounding the village, visiting the nearby Lastingham . The walk runs for about 4 miles with some moderate climbing on the return leg from Lastingham. In Lastingham a visit to the beautiful St Mary's Church is advised. It has an exquisite interior which includes an eleventh-century crypt. Just to the east of the village you can continue your walking in the expansive Cropton Forest . The long distance Tabular Hills Walk runs through Hutton-le-Hole. You could pick it up and follow it through Appleton-le-Moors to the woods. Continuing along the Tabular Hills Walk will eventually bring you to Levisham and the wonderful Hole of Horcum which is a must see if you are visiting the area. To the north of the village are the popular valleys of Rosedale where you can visit the historic abbey, the splendid old kilns at Rosedale Chimney Bank and the heritage mineral railway on the Rosedale Railway Walk . There's also Farndale and the popular Daffodil Walk to try in spring. You are also not far from the town of Pickering where you can visit the castle and enjoy walks along the Pickering Beck. You can also pick up the popular North Yorkshire Moors Railway here.",
