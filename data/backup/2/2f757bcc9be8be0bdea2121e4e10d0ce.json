  "description": "This circular hike takes you around the stunning Loch Coruisk in the Cullin Hills on the Isle of Skye. It's a remote spot with some fairly rugged paths surrounding the isolated loch. Legend has it that the fresh water loch is the home of a kelpie or water horse, a shape-shifting creature that can assume human form. The site is located south of Sligachan and north of Elgol. If you head north west of the loch you could visit another of the area's highlights at the delightful Fairy Pools .",

Here you can pick up the circular Portree Scorrybreac Walk and enjoy views of the picturesque harbour, the colourful buildings of Portree town and out to the Island of Raasay. To the north west there's the lovely Talisker Bay Beach. Here you will find a lovely, quiet beach with some impressive sea stacks and views to a waterfall.
