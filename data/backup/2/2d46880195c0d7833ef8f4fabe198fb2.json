  "description": "This pretty Kent based town is surrounded by some lovely High Weald countryside and several large areas of woodland. It's an interesting town to stroll around too with several medieval buildings, a church known as the 'Cathedral of the Weald' and a very photogenic working windmill. This walk from the Cranbrook visits one of the highlights of the area at the nearby Sissinghurst Castle . It's about a 3 mile walk from the town to the castle, passing through some attractive woodland and farmland on the way. The walk starts from the centre of the town centre where you can pick up the High Weald Landscape Trail . Follow the trail north east past The Park, Wisley Green, Hilly Wood and Buckhurst Farm and you will soon come to Sissinghurst village. It's a quaint little village with a picturesque collection of pretty white clapboard cottages and a local pub. The route then heads north and then east to arrive at Sissinghurst Castle. There's 460 acres of parkland, woodland and gardens to explore on a number of well laid out footpaths. After exploring the castle grounds the route returns to Cranbrook on the same paths. Back in the village you could pay a visit to the notable Cranbrook Windmill. The working mill was built in 1814\u00a0and is the tallest smock mill in the United Kingdom. You can climb the sails for wonderful views over the area and learn all about the heritage of the town inside. Also of interest is the Church of St Dunstan\u00a0which is known as the \u2018Cathedral of the Weald\u2019. The church includes the clock mechanism was the prototype for London's Big Ben.",
