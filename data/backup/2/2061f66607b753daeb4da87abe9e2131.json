  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the village of Llansteffan on the south coast of Carmarthenshire. On the way you'll enjoy a lovely stretch of coast and a visit to the historic Llansteffan Castle. Starting in the centre of the village it's a short stroll to the estuary of the River Towy. Follow the coast path south, past the pretty dunes and you will soon come to the castle. The castle was built by the Normans after 1100 as part of their invasion of Wales and granted to the Marmion family before passing to the de Camvilles through marriage. It sits on a much older Iron Age promontory fort, proving Llansteffan has been inhabited for several millennia. After passing the atmospheric ruins of the castle the footpath continues south to Scott's Bay. At Anthony's Cottage the path turns inland to climb through the countryside before following country lanes back into the village. To continue your walking in the area, head west to visit the splendid town of Laugharne. Here you can visit two major highlights of the area at Laugharne Castle and the Dylan Thomas Boathouse. The castle dates from the 12th century and has a fascinating history. The boathouse is now a museum with lots of interesting exhibits to view. You could also visit the county town of Carmarthen where there's nice walks to be had in Carmarthen park and along the River Towy.",
