  "description": "Enjoy a climb to Helsby Hill Fort on this short circular walk in Cheshire. The hill is one of the notable landmarks of the area, standing over 450ft above the village of Helsby below. From the summit there are splendid views over the Mersey Estuary, the city of Liverpool and into Wales. You can start your walk from the Helsby Quarry car park off Alvanley Road, about 1 mile to the south of the hill summit. Then head north, crossing the road before picking up the woodland trails towards the hill top. Here you pick up a section of the North Cheshire Way to take you to the edge of the woodland, before turning around and picking up the Middle Walk trail to take you back down the hill. Several long distance trails pass Helsby Hill so you can pick any of these up to extend your walk. For example you could follow the Longster Trail south to Harmer's Wood and then on to the pretty Manly Mere where there is an adventure trail to try. The Sandstone Trail runs just to the east of Helsby. On this trail you can climb to the nearby Woodhouses Hill Fort and then on to Frodsham Hill near Overton. Here you can also link up with the Delamere Way and follow it south east to the expansive Delamere Forest near Kelsall. The Longster Trail starts on Helsby Hill so this is another good option. The long distance path runs from Helsby to Chester via the villages of Great Barrow and Guilden Sutton.",
