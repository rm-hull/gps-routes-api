    "description": "This circular walk visits Deffer Wood in West Yorkshire. The woods are a peaceful place with nice trails and lots of bluebells in the spring months.\nYou can start the walk from the car park at Cannon Hall Country Park and follow a footpath north west along the Jowett House Beck to the woods. The walk then explores the woods on various paths before picking up another public footpath at the eastern end. This will take you along the edge of the park toward the village of Cawthorne. From here you can follow the waymarked Barnsley Boundary Walk back to the car park where the route finishes. In the woods look out for a variety of woodland birds including woodpeckers, pied flycatcher and crossbill. At the northern end of the woods you can pick up our Denby Dale Circular Walk which explores the area surrounding the village.",
