One of the purposes of the canal was to provide Coventry with a regular supply of cheap coal from the Bedworth coalfield, which it already did by 1769.\nThe towpath here is used as part of The Centenary Way, a long distance walking path covering about 100 miles in Warwickshire."

There's also some lovely Cotswolds scenery and typical pretty villages with thatched cottages and Norman churches. The path is well waymarked with a green and white disc picturing a bear.",
