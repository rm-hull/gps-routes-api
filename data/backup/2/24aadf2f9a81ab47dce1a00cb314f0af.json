Originally established as McHugh's Hotel & Tearooms in the early twentieth century, it also housed a schoolhouse. Presently, it remains under the ownership of the McHugh family. In 2005, the hotel underwent significant renovations, introducing additional rooms, a heated pool, a spa, and a new restaurant. Notably, in 2007, the hotel served as the rally headquarters for the final stage in the Rally Ireland stages. In 2010, the Pier Head Hotel hosted the legendary Leonard Cohen, who chose Mullaghmore for its peaceful ambiance outside of Sligo town. Cohen, known for his appreciation of scenic walks, enjoyed the beach and the village during his stay. The hotel was his residence while he performed two gigs in Sligo, with one of them being at Lissadell House, a venue he praised as one of his favorites. In 2015, The Pier Head welcomed Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, during their official visit to Mullaghmore, a place with personal significance as it is where Prince Charles's uncle was tragically killed. The hotel even organized a brief history exhibition for the royal visitors. As of July 2022, The Pier Head Hotel boasts over 40 rooms, Nimmo's residents bar (named after the Harbour's designer), and a restaurant known as The Clashybann Restaurant, offering scenic views of Donegal Bay. The restaurant is open to the public, as is the leisure centre and the Quay Bar."

Built in the 19th century, the castle stands proudly against the backdrop of Mullaghmore Head, contributing to the area's unique charm.. Designed in the Baronial style by the accomplished Dublin architect James Rawson Carroll, the castle stands as a testament to the historical and cultural richness of the region. Its construction employed a yellow-brown sandstone, meticulously transported by sea from County Donegal, showcasing the dedication to craftsmanship and attention to detail. The architectural ensemble of Classiebawn Castle includes a distinctive gabled range featuring a central tower crowned by a conical-roofed turret, adding to the castle's picturesque allure. The castle's design echoes the Baronial style, characterised by its romanticised interpretation of medieval architecture, creating a harmonious blend with the rugged coastal surroundings. The history of Classiebawn Castle is intertwined with the complex narratives of Irish land ownership. Originally part of the holdings of the O'Connor Sligo family, the land upon which the castle stands underwent confiscation by the English Parliament as a form of compensation for those who quelled an Irish rebellion. Subsequently, approximately 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) of this land were granted to Sir John Temple (1600\u20131677), who held the esteemed position of Master of the Rolls in Ireland."

      "caption": "Mullaghmore Beach. Mullaghmore is renowned as a destination for big wave surfing. On 8 March 2012, surfers and windsurfers, hailing from various corners of the globe, navigated waves reaching heights of up to 15 metres (49 ft) off Mullaghmore Head. Although impressive, these waves fell short by about five metres (16 ft) compared to the tallest wave ever recorded in Ireland, which occurred in County Donegal on 13 December 2011, measuring a staggering 20.4 metres (67 ft). The formidable waves at Mullaghmore were a consequence of a intricate weather system aptly named the \"Viking storm,\" creating significant wave conditions in the region consistently for the month of March over a 15-year period. Despite the thrill, some riders experienced injuries, including bruising, broken bones, and damaged surfboards. A low-pressure system originating from North America advanced eastward and merged with another cyclone in the Western Atlantic. This combined system positioned itself off the coast of Ireland, already marked by high waves from preceding strong weather systems. Furthermore, a robust anticyclone over the Azores established a substantial pressure gradient in the North Atlantic, directing a powerful fetch towards Ireland. Alongside this, there was an extended fetch length in the North Atlantic directed towards Europe, contributing to the creation of swells. The amalgamation of these conditions was validated by satellite data on 7 March 2012, confirming waves exceeding 15 metres (49 ft) in height."

The Beach Hotel, positioned just across the road from the Pier Head and offering a picturesque view of the harbour, has been a prominent establishment in Mullaghmore since its inception in the 1950s. Over the years, it has been a favored choice, especially during the heyday of showbands. In the late 1990s, the hotel underwent expansions that included the introduction of Corki's Niteclub and the establishment of a leisure center featuring a 15-meter pool, a gym, and a Jacuzzi. Notably, the hotel was showcased in Episode 6 of Series 7 of RT\u00c9's At Your Service in 2015. Renowned hoteliers Francis Brennan and his brother John intervened to revitalize the hotel, implementing a comprehensive plan encompassing room renovations, refurbishment of the function room, and a strategic rebranding initiative. Despite budget constraints leading to the decommissioning of the leisure center, the outcomes were transformative, breathing new life into the hotel. Presently, the Beach Hotel boasts 28 rooms, a resident's restaurant, and the Boatmans Bistro Bar, open to the public, marking its continued success in Mullaghmore."
