  "description": "This circular walk uses part of the Oxfordshire Way long distance trail to explore the area around the Oxfordshire town of Charlbury. The walk is just over 4 miles long, using waymarked footpaths to take you through a lovely part of the Evenlode Valley area of the Cotswolds. There's some attractive countryside, pockets of woodland and good views of the River Evenlode to enjoy. The town is accessible by rail on the Cotswold Line. It is served by First Great Western trains between London, Oxford, Great Malvern, Worcester and Hereford. This walk starts from the train station which is just to the west of the town. To extend your walking in the Charlbury area you can head south west from the town and visit Wychwood Forest where you will find hundreds of acres of attractive woodland, pretty streams and a series of lakes and ponds. If you follow the Oxfordshire Way south east from the town you can visit the wonderful Blenheim Park. It's about an 8 mile walk to the park, via the village of Stonesfield. You could also follow the Oxfordshire way west to Ascott-under-Wychwood. The path follows the river all the way to the village.",

They have an excellent selection of beers and were voted CAMRA Oxfordshire Pub of the Year and North Oxfordshire Pub of the Year in 2018. You can find the pub at 1 Market St with a postcode of OX7 3PL for your sat navs. The Rose and Crown doesn't do food so if you're looking for a bite to eat head to The Bell Inn. The pub is set in a beautiful 18th century Cotswold stone building and has a very good menu. You can find it on Church Street at postcode OX7 3PP."

You can also visit the lovely Foxholes Nature Reserve where there are more nice woodland trails and pretty bluebells in the spring months. Just a few miles to the north there's the historic Heythrop Park to explore. The 18th century hotel is surrounded by some beautiful parkland and gardens with miles of walking and cycling trails to try."
