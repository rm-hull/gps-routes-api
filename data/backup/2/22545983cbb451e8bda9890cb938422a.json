  "description": "Explore 450 acres of community country park in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. There are a number of well maintained footpaths taking you to open meadows, secluded woodland glades and silent pools. Look out for Skylark, lapwing, grey partridge, water vole and Great Crested Newt in Apedale's wetland and ancient woodland. In the spring months the park is particularly lovely with carpets of bluebells in the woodland area. For cyclists there are also some good mountain bike trails to try. The park is located on a former mining area so there's a small museum with an interesting collection of mining related items. There's also a working narrow gauge railway to enjoy. The Newcastle Way walk also passes through the park so you could continue your walk. The adjacent Silverdale Country Park is also a good option if you would like to continue your outing.",

The Newcastle Under Lyme Walk follows the pretty Lyme Brook from the town centre and is just over 2 miles to the park. A few miles south of the park you'll find the village of Keele. Here you can explore the lovely campus of Keele University which includes an arboretum, lakes and gardens. It's well laid out with several colour coded footpaths to try. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
