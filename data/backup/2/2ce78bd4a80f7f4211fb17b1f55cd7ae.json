This pub is now the main feature of Osmington Mills and in the summer it is heaving with tourists and holidaymakers from the nearby Osmington Mills Holidays site. The pub was originally called The Crown Inn, later the Picnic Inn. The present name is a reference to the role that the pub's past landlords played in smuggling. The South West coast path runs alongside the stream in front of the pub and up the steps on the right in the foreground."

  "description": "This walk follows a lovely section of the Jurassic Coast from Lulworth Cove to Osmington Mills. On the way you'll pass several highlights of the area including Durdle Door , Swyre Head and Ringstead Bay . The walk starts at the car park at Lulworth Cove and heads west past St Oswald's Bay along the waymarked South West Coast Path . After a short while you will come to the natural limestone arch of Durdle Door where you can descend to the little beach if you have time. After passing the arch the route continues to Swyre Head, the highest point in the Purbeck Hills. It's a great spot standing at an elevation of 208 m (682 ft) and commanding views as far as Dartmoor and the Isle of Portland near Weymouth. The Isle of Wight, Lulworth Cove, Poole Harbour and much of the Purbeck Hills are also visible on a clear day. The route then descends from the hill and continues to Ringstead Bay. It's another stunningly beautiful area with the cliffs and views at White Nothe particularly special. Soon after passing the bay you come into Osmington Mills where there's a pretty village with a nice pub for refreshments. If you'd like to extend your walk you could climb to the Osmington White Horse and enjoy more wonderful views.",
