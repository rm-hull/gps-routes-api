The tranquil medieval woodland contains ancient limes and is well known for its large numbers of butterflies. There are three colour coded walking trails to try. Two are very easy walks on well surfaced paths which will suit all abilites. There is also a longer route which can be a bit muddy. It's a very tranquil place with a diversity of flora of fauna to look out for. Birdwatchers can look out for nuthatch, Woodlark, Buzzard, Hen harrier and green and great spotted woodpecker. There have also been 16 species of butterfly recorded. The reserve is located about 10 miles east of Lincoln, and not far from Horncastle .",
