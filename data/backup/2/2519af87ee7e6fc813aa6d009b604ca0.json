The mill as one might expect was used to grind corn in flour but was finally used to produce animal feed. When it ground to a halt in 1956 and was the last working tide-mill. To the left you will see the granary where the wheat was stored. The tide mill was restored and opened to the public in 1972. The pond in which tide water was trapped to run the mill became the Yacht Harbour a small pond still exists for demonstration of the mill."
