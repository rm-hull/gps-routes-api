  "description": "Explore over 600 acres of grassy coastal plain, salt marsh, sand dunes and grasslands in this coastal country park in Devon. The park overlooks the beautiful Taw Torridge Estuary within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. At the northern end of Westward Ho! beach is the Northam Burrows Centre. The centre has a wealth of information about the park and  also runs family activities during the summer months. The South West Coast Path runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along the beautiful Devon coast in either direction. The park is located just north of Bideford between Westward Ho and Appledore. You can reach the park easily from the village along the coast path. See the circular Appledore Walk for more details. Our Bideford Circular Walk also runs close to the park and is a good way of reaching the park from Bideford or for extending your exercise.",
