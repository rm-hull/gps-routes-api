  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the viewpoint at Old Hills before visiting Stanbrook Abbey where you'll find a family fun trail. The walk starts from the car park at Old Hills and follows a footpath west to the viewpoint. There's a trig point and fine views to the Malvern Hills and Worcester Cathedral from this elevated spot. You then head around Woodsfield Farm to Deblin's Green and Kent's Green before coming to Stanbrook Abbey. The former Benedictine monastery is set within 26 acres of lovely grounds. There's a nice woodland trail to follow around the estate before following a country lane south past Callow End. The route then heads west along Pixham Ferry Lane to return to the Old Hills car park.",

The epic Three Choirs Way also runs through the area. To the south are the historic settlements of Tewkesbury, Upton Upon Severn and Twyning where you can enjoy more waterside trails along the River Avon. A few miles to the south there's the delightful village of Hanley Swan. The picturesque settlement includes a pretty village green, a pond, a 17th century pub and walking trails to neighbouring Hanley Castle where you can see the remains of the ancient fort.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Worcestershire Walks and the Malvern Hills Walks page."
