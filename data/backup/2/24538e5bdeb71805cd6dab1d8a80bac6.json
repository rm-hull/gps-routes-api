  "description": "Enjoy nearly 500 acres of heathlands, woodlands and ponds on this circular cycle or walk in Yateley, Hampshire. The route begins at the car park by Wyndham's Pool and takes you along a sequence of peaceful woodland trails to Yately Heath Wood and Minley Wood, before returning to the start point. It's easy to extend your walk by heading south to Hawley Woods and Hawley Lake near Farnborough. Head north and you can visit the lovely Tri Lakes Country Park with its numerous pretty lakes and animal park.",

      "content": "A couple of miles south of the park there's a nice circular trail around Fleet Pond to try. There's lots of water loving birds to look out for on the water and some interesting flora in the nature reserve. It's also notable as the largest freshwater lake in the county at 52 acres. Near the pond you'll find Fleet train station so you could potentially come by public transport and explore the pond before heading to the common. The Three Castles Path passes just to the north of the common. This historically themed long distance trail will take you from Windsor Castle to Winchester Castle, visiting the ruined Odiham Castle on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
