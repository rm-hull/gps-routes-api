  "description": "This walk heads from Eastbourne to Hastings along a lovely section of the East Sussex coast. The route runs for a distance of about 15 miles on a flat path. As such it's possible to complete in a day for fit walkers. On the way you'll pass Pevensey Bay and Bexhill with fine sea views and pretty beaches for most of the way. The walk starts at the pier at Eastbourne and heads north east to the pretty Sovereign Habour where there's lots of boats moored at a new development. You continue to Pevensey Bay, an attractive area which is also of some historical significance. It was here that\u00a0William the Conqueror\u00a0made the landing in his invasion of England in 1066 after crossing the English Channel from Normandy, France. There's a shingle beach here and two Martello towers, constructed in 1806 as Napoleonic coastal defences. Also look out for the ruins of the medieval Pevensey Castle and the 16th century Castle Inn. The next section takes you past Norman's Bay to the town of Bexhill. It's worth enjoying a stroll around the town where there is some interesting\u00a0Edwardian\u00a0and\u00a0Victorian architecture. On the seafront there's also the noteworthy\u00a0De La Warr Pavilion. The Grade I listed building is a centre for contemporary art, having featured the work of\u00a0Andy Warhol,\u00a0Cerith Wyn Evans\u00a0and\u00a0sculptor Richard Wilson\u00a0over the years. The final section of the route takes you from Bexhill to Hastings, passing Glyne Gap before finishing at the pier. Built in 1872 the pier was restored in 2017 and reopened to the public in the spring of 2019.",
