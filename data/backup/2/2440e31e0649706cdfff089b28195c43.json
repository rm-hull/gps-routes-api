  "description": "This pretty Peak District village is located in the Hope Valley area of the National Park. Though not as popular as some of its neighbouring villages it is well worth a visit. It's very picturesque with many old stone cottages, a historic limestone church and the\u00a0Bradwell Brook running through the centre. This circular walk from the village takes you to the Navio Roman Fort, Brough and Bradwell Edge. It runs for just under 4 miles with a moderate climb on the way. There's some splendid Peak District scenery with far reaching views over the National Park from the high points. The walk starts in the village and picks up a public footpath heading north towards Brough before turning west to visit the Navio Roman Fort. The remains of the fort are situated in a flat green field, above a sharp bend in the\u00a0River Noe, just to the west of Brough. The route then heads back to Brough before turning south to Elmore Hill Farm. You then begin an ascent to Bradwell Edge which rises to a height of over 1100ft. There's some fine views over the area from here and you will often see hang-gliders launching on the weekends. After enjoying the views the route descends into the village on a country lane.",
