  "description": "This expansive site of Special Scientific Interest is a great place for walks and wildlife. The area is located just a few miles east of Doncaster in South Yorkshire. This walk on the moors explores the Humberhead Peatlands National Nature Reserve before picking up a section of the Peatlands Way and following it to the nearby village of Epworth. The area is wonderful for bird watching with species including Nightjars, Grey Partrige and Corn Bunting. Around the wetland areas there's also lots of wildfowl including Ringed Plover, Crane and Snipe to see. The walk starts at the car park for the Humberhead Peatlands National Nature Reserve. You can explore the wetlands and wildlife of the reserve on a series of waymarked trails before picking up the waymarked Peatlands Way on the eastern fringes. Follow the trail east and it will take you along the River Torne towards Wroot and the Epworth Turbury Nature Reserve. Shortly after you arrive at Epworth village on the Isle of Axholme Greenway. You can enjoy some refreshment here before returning to the reserve. To continue your walking on the moors head north to pick up the Keadby Canal. There's some pleasant grassy footpaths along the canal which runs along the northern edge of the moors. The Peatlands Way will also take you to Thorne Moors, another nature reserve which makes up part of the Humberhead Peatlands National Nature Reserve.",
