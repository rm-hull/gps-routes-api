    "description": "This circular walk climbs to Tregonning Hill near the town of Helston in Cornwall. You can start the walk on the country lane at Balwest where you can pick up a footpath leading up to the hill top. The path then bends round to return you to the country lane, creating a short circular walk. On the hill there's heathland, an Iron Age hillfort and a grade II listed Germoe war memorial to see. There's also fine views over the Cornish countryside to the coast a few miles to the west. You can view a list of the visible landmarks on the handy Topograph at the top. These include Lizard Point and the neighbouring hills of Carn Brea and St Agnes Beacon. The hill is located just south of the Godolphin Estate which provides the perfect opportunity for extending your walk. You could head about a mile north to climb Godolphin Hill for more great views.",
