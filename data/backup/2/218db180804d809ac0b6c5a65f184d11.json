    "description": "This Essex based commuter town is located on the tidal River Crouch, within the Borough of Basildon . The town includes a pleasant local nature reserve and country park where you can enjoy some easy local walking. This walk takes you along the River Crouch to visit the Shotgate Thickets Nature Reserve , just to the east of the town. The reserve is managed by Essex Wildlife Trust and is a nice place for a stroll and some wildlife watching. There's also some woodland trails and views of the River Crouch to enjoy here. You can continue your walking around Wickford by heading south to visit Wick Country Park.  Here you'll find 50 acres of former agricultural land, with over 2 km  of easy access trails around the site. In the park you'll also find a lake, ponds, woodland, and boardwalks over the North Benfleet brook. You can find the park at postcode SS12 9LD, to the south east of the town centre and train station.",
