  "description": "This walk visits the town of Lahinch on Liscannor Bay, on the northwest coast of County Clare. The walk first takes you along the beach before following the Burren Way to the Cliffs of Moher, one of the walking highlights of the area. The walk starts at the car parking area on the seafront in Lahinch. You can then stroll north along the promenade and the beach with the golf course on your right. The route then crosses the Inagh River on O'Brien's Bridge before heading through the countryside to Liscannor with fine views over Liscannor Bay. The route then continues north west to the coast where you pick up the Doolin Cliff Walk which will takes you along the Cliffs of Moher. On the wonderful cliff top path there's fabulous views over the  Atlantic coast and a large variety of sea birds to look out for. After exploring the cliffs you can then catch a bus back to Lahinch from the Cliffs of Moher coach park.",
