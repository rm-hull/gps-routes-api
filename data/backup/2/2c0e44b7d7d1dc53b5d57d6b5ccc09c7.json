  "description": "This walk visits Penn Wood near High Wycombe and Amersham in Buckinghamshire. The walk starts in the car park on Penn Street on the eastern side of the woods. From here you can pick up the peaceful trails through the ancient woodland. Here you'll find pretty ponds and lots of bluebells during the spring months. It's also great for wildlife with lots of woodland birds, foxes, deer and red kites to see.",
