  "description": "This circular walk visits the historic Hailes Abbey in Gloucestershire. It then uses a section of the Gloucestershire Way to visit the nearby town of Winchcombe. As such the route could also be started/finished from the town if your prefer. The route runs for about 7 miles, exploring the countryside surrounding the abbey. It starts and ends at the abbey car park, located next to Hailes Wood about two miles north east of Winchcombe. The ruined abbey dates back to 1246 is and is designated as a Grade I listed building. It is now under the care of English Heritage and includes a fascinating museum where you can learn all about the abbey's history. You can extend the walk by heading a little to the south to visit the neighbouring Sudeley Castle, another highlight of the area.",
