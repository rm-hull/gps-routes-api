  "description": "This long distance waymarked walk runs for about 90 miles across the beautiful countryside of the Yorkshire Dales. The trail runs from Saltaire to Appleby-in-Westmorland, passing a series of delightful villages, expansive moors and challenging hill climbs. Starting in Saltaire the route first heads north across Bingley Moor and Ilkley Moor to Ilkley. You continue to Addingham and Skipton where you will pass Skipton Castle where there's some fine woodland walks and fascinating history. The next stage runs into the Yorkshire Dales National Park passing Hetton before a waterside stroll along the pretty Winterburn Reservoir. Continuing north west you come to a major highlight of the area at Malham. Here you can explore the hugely popular Malham Tarn Estate and visit the photogenic Malham Cove. The route also links up with the epic Pennine Way in this area. The route heads west from here to Settle where you can pick up part of the Settle Riverside Walk along the Ribble Way. Here you will also pass the splendid Stainforth Force waterfall on the riverside trail. The route continues north west to another significant highlight at Ingleborough Mountain. One of Yorshire's Three Peaks, the mountain stands at a height of 723 metres (2,372 ft) providing wonderful views over the National Park. After descending the mountain you continue north towards Dentdale where there's more pleasant waterside trails along the River Dee towards Sedbergh. From here the trail heads north to climb The Calf before following the Bowderdale Beck to Newbiggin On Lune. The final section continues north towards the splendid limestone pavement at Great Asby Scar before passing Rutter Force waterfall and finishing in Appleby on the River Eden.
