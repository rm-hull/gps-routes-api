A fire in 1897 resulted in the rebuilding of the 1884 mill; it was then equipped with a six-sack roller plant \u0091on system of Messrs Thomas Robinson and Son Ltd of Rochdale\u0092. The Mill is listed Grade II."

  "description": "This delightful Devon village is surrounded by some lovely rolling countryside making it a fine place to start a walk. There's riverside trails and peaceful country lanes with a noteworthy 18th century inn to relax in after your exercise. This circular walk from the village uses part of the Exe Valley Way and series of quiet country lanes to explore the area to the north of the settlement. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Exe Valley Way and follow the waymarked footpath north along the River Exe to Nether Exe, Latchmoor Green and the neighbouring village of Thorverton. Here you cross the river at Thorverton Mill and head west through the village. You could enjoy a pit stop here at the local pub at what is roughly the half way point on the walk. The route continues west before turning south along a lovely country lane with fine countryside views to enjoy. Follow the lanes south and then east and you will return to the village.",
