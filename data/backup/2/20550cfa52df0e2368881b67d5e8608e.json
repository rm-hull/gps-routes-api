It consisted of a cruciform church, cloister, garden and ancillary structures. The monks would have made a living from rents and spiritual duties, while providing work for the local people who serviced the priory."

  "description": "Haverfordwest is the county town of Pembrokeshire. There are some nice waterside walks along the River Cleddau which runs through the town. The town is also not far from the wonderful Pembrokeshire Coast Path. This walk takes you along the Western Cleddau to the village of Little Milford, just to the south of the town. The walk starts at the ruins of Haverfordwest priory, located next to the river, just to the south west of the train station. It's a peaceful and atmospheric spot with the picturesque ruins and flowing river. There's also a number of information boards detailing the history of the priory which dates back to the 12th century. From here you can pick up a public footpath heading south along the river to the village of Little Milford. The area is run by the National Trust and includes ancient woodland and river views. You can follow the peaceful trails around the woods before returning to Haverfordwest on the same river paths. If you continue south you could visit nearby Llangwm where there are some fine trails along the river estuary with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way.",
