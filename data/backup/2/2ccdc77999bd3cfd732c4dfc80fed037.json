  "description": "This short circular walk visits the Waggoners Wells beauty spot in East Hampshire. The area is run by the National Trust and includes a series of ponds surrounded by attractive woodland. You can start the walk from the Waggoners Wells car park at Hindhead. From here you can pick up footpaths heading west along the picturesque ponds which are thought to date from the medieval period. There's also a wishing well with a Tennyson poem which he composed at the site. The Tennyson memorial statue in Lincoln shows him holding a flower in his hand and a plaque with this poem. You can extend the walk by following a series of bridleways and footpaths north onto the expansive Ludshott Common .",

Just a few miles to the south east there's the significant site of Black Down to explore. The Down includes some fine ancient woodland and is notable as the highest point in the South Downs, commanding wonderful views towards the coast. Just south of Black Down there's the worthy village of Lurgashall to explore. The picturesque settlement includes a pretty village green, a quintessentially English cricket pitch, a millpond, a historic Saxon church and a number of historic timber framed properties to admire. To the south west is the village of Liphook where you can enjoy a walk to the lakes on the pretty Foley Manor Estate before a climb to Weavers Down on the edge of the expansive Woolmer Forest.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
