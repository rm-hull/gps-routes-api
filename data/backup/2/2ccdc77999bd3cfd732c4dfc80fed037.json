  "description": "This short circular walk visits the Waggoners Wells beauty spot in East Hampshire. The area is run by the National Trust and includes a series of ponds surrounded by attractive woodland. You can start the walk from the Waggoners Wells car park at Hindhead. From here you can pick up footpaths heading west along the picturesque ponds which are thought to date from the medieval period. There's also a wishing well with a Tennyson poem which he composed at the site. The Tennyson memorial statue\u00a0in Lincoln shows him holding a flower in his hand and a plaque with this poem. You can extend the walk by following a series of bridleways and footpaths north onto the expansive Ludshott Common .",
