  "description": "This walk takes you through the area around How Hill House in the Norfolk Broads. The house includes lovely parkland and gardens with riverside paths along the River Ant which runs past the site. The area is also a nature reserve so keep your eyes peeled for a wide variety of birds and insects on your visit. You can take a trip on the Electric Eel boat and look out for marsh harriers, dragonflies and butterflies as you make your way along the river. The walk starts at the How Hill car park just to the west of the pretty village of Ludham. From here you can pick up footpaths heading around the beautiful gardens. These include herbaceous borders, a walled garden and a rose garden with lots of pretty butterflies to see in the summer months. There's also a secret garden with stunning azaleas and rhododendrons to see in May and June. The route then leads you to the river at Turf Fen. You can then follow a nice riverside path south along the River Ant for a couple of miles to Ludham Bridge and Mill. Here you'll find a riverside cafe and a picturesque boatyard. The trail then returns to the car park on the same footpaths. On the way you'll pass the Toad Hole Cottage Museum where you can find out about the life of a marsh man in bygone days in the Broads. It's a quaint little spot right next to the river.",
