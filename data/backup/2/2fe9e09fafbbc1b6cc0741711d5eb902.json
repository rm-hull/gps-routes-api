Arthur Wellesley Peel was an MP and Speaker of the House of Commons. In 1934, the house was sold to Sir Malcolm Stewart and the formal gardens were established. The RSPB has had its UK headquarters at The Lodge since 1961."

  "description": "This Bedfordshire based market town has some nice waterside trails along the River Ivel and a significant local nature reserve to explore. This circular walk visits The Lodge, an RSPB Nature Reserve at Sandy Warren. The reserve is the headquarters of the RSPB and located just to the south east of the town centre and train station. There's lovely woodland walking trails, attractive heathland, lots of wildlife and some beautiful gardens to see near the visitor centre. You can start the walk from the car park, off the Potton Road at the north eastern tip of the reserve. Then follow the trails south past Bunker's Hill to the Lodge. Here you'll find an excellent visitor centre where you can learn all about the flora and fauna at the site. Bird species to look out for on the walk include woodpeckers, hobby and nuthatch. There's also some lovely formal gardens to explore around the 19th century Swiss Cottage. To the south of the reserve you can pick up the Biggleswade Green Wheel. The shared walking and cycling trail explores the area using a section of the Kingfisher Way which runs along the River Ivel on the western side of the reserve. It visits one of the local riverside highlights at the historic Jordan's Mill which is well worth a visit. The Greensand Ridge Walk also passes just to the north of the reserve and provides an opportunity to extend your walk on a good waymarked footpath.",

      "content": "To continue your walking around Sandy you could pick up the Bedford to Sandy Country Way. The shared walking and cycling trail follows a dismantled railway line to the nearby town. On the way it visits the nearby Priory Country Park where there's 360 acres of lakes, meadows, woodland and riverside paths along the River Great Ouse. You'll also pass the delightful village of Great Barford. There's nice river trails along the Ouse, an ancient arched bridge and a notable church with a 15th century tower to see here. A few miles to the east you can pick up the long distance Clopton Way in Potton Wood where there are peaceful woodland trails and lots of pretty bluebells in the spring. For more walking ideas in the area see the Bedfordshire Walks page."
