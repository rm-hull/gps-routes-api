  "description": "Follow this splendid walking path from Portchester to Winchester and enjoy the wonderful Hampshire countryside. You start off at the medieval Portchester Castle at the head of Portsmouth Harbour. The route then heads north towards Fareham and then onto Fort Nelson, one of five defensive forts built on the summit of Portsdown Hill in the 1860s. From here you continue to the town of Bishop's Waltham. Here you'll find the moated Bishop's Palace ruin built in 1135. The final section of the walk takes you through the beautiful Itchen Valley and along the River Itchen to Winchester where the walk finishes near the splendid cathedral.",
