  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the Kilvey Hill viewpoint in Swansea . The hill is located on the south eastern side of the city, near to the docks. There's some fine views and peaceful community woodland trails to enjoy in this area. You can start the walk near Jersey park, on Harbour View Road. From here you can pick up woodland footpaths heading east and then north up to the hill top which stands at a height of 193 metres (633\u00a0ft). From here there are excellent views of\u00a0the city centre,\u00a0the docks,\u00a0Swansea Bay,\u00a0and Port Talbot . At the summit you'll also find an old ruined windmill, a TV transmitter station\u00a0and a telecommunications mast.\u00a0After taking in the views you can descend on alternative paths in the community woodland area to the south of the hill.",
