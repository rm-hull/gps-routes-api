  "description": "This walk takes you from the Cutty Sark to the Greenwich Peninsula where you can enjoy great views of the Millenium Dome. The walk starts from the Cutty Sark for Maritime Greenwich station on the Docklands Light Railway. From here it is short hop to the river and the famous 19th century clipper ship. You then head east along the Thames Path rounding the Greenwich Peninsula and the Millennium Dome, now known as the 02 arena. The dome was completed in 1999 and originally housed the Millennium Experience, a major exhibition celebrating the beginning of the third millennium. The dome is one of the largest of its type in the world with the Prime Meridian passing the western edge. You can extend the walk by continuing east along the Thames Path through New Charlton and Woolwich. Heading north from the pier you can visit the Isle of Dogs. Also nearby is the splendid Greenwich Park where there's 180 acres of wide lawns, tree lined avenues, orchards and pretty gardens.",

You can find it in a fine location at the top of the hill by the Royal Observatory. Built in 1906 the octagonal building is topped by a dove-cot with a weather vane showing Nelson looking through his telescope. In fine weather make the most of the large garden at the front and rear. There's a good menu which includes freshly made stone-baked pizzas, soup, sandwiches and hearty hot dishes."
