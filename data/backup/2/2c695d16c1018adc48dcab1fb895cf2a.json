  "description": "The Green Chain Walk visits a number of London's prettiest parks and open spaces while also passing through some interesting urban areas. This section of the route runs from Thamesmead to Crystal Palace. It covers a distance of just over 14 miles on a fairly flat, waymarked footpath. As such it could be completed on a single day. You'll visit a number of peaceful woods, attractive parks and historical sites allowing you to reconnect with nature in an urban environment. The walk begins on the River Thames at Thamesmead and passes Lesnes Abbey Woods, Oxleas Wood, Bostall Woods, Avery Hill Park, Eltham Palace, Elmstead Woods and Beckenham Place Park before finishing at Crystal Palace Park. Highlights on the walk include the fascinating ruins of the 12th century Lesnes Abbey and the splendid views from the elevated terrace garden in Oxleas Wood .",
