  "description": "This shared cycling and walking trail runs from Penicuik to Dalkeith along a dismantled railway line. The Penicuik line opened in 1872 and closed in 1967. It's now a pleasant leisure route taking you through some of Midlothian\u2019s historic villages. Along the way there's lovely country views and lots of flora and fauna to look out for. The route starts in Penicuik on the River North Esk. You then follow the waymarked trail north along the eastern side of the town. The trail then turns east to take you past Old Woodhouselee Castle and Roslin Glen Country Park. The pretty park includes wooded glens, the ruined Roslin Castle and views of the rushing River North Esk. After passing through the park you continue north east past Bonnyrigg and Lasswade before coming into Dalkeith where you can explore Dalkeith Country Park .",

Just to the east of the park you can pick up the Pencaitland Railway Walk. The trail runs along a dismantled railway and is suitable for both walkers and cyclists. Similarly the Haddington to Longniddry Railway Walk runs between the two East Lothian towns for a distance of about 5 miles. Near here you'll also find the Gosford Estate where there's some nice trails to follow around the grounds of grand mansion. Just to the north of the start point you can try the Flotterstone to Glencorse Reservoir Walk and the climb to the viewpoint at Scald Law. At Roslin you could take a detour to visit the noteworthy Rosslyn Chapel. There's some stunning architecture at the 15th century site which includes some pleasant trails through a wooded glen to the ruins of Roslin Castle. The chapel became famous when it was featured in Dan Brown's the Da Vinci Code. For more walks in the area see the Edinburgh Walks page."
