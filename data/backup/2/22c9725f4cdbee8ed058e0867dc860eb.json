    "description": "This shared cycling and walking trail runs from Penicuik to Dalkeith along a dismantled railway line. The Penicuik line opened in 1872 and closed in 1967. It's now a pleasant leisure route taking you through some of Midlothian\u2019s historic villages. Along the way there's lovely country views and lots of flora and fauna to look out for. The route starts in Penicuik on the River North Esk. You then follow the waymarked trail north along the eastern side of the town. The trail then turns east to take you past Old Woodhouselee Castle and Roslin Glen Country Park . The pretty park includes wooded glens, the ruined Roslin Castle and views of the rushing River North Esk. After passing through the park you continue north east past Bonnyrigg and Lasswade before coming into Dalkeith where you can explore Dalkeith Country Park .",
