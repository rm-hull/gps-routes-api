  "description": "This walk takes you along a section of the Anglesey Coast Path from Trearddur Bay to the White Eagle pub in Rhoscolyn. It's about a 3 mile walk along an undulating coastal path with tremendous views and interesting geology including two photogenic Natural sea arches. You can start the walk in the car park at Trearddur Bay. From here you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it south to Porth Diana and Ravens Point. You continue south past Gromlech before coming to Porth Saint. Here you leave the coast, following footpaths east into Rhoscolyn where you can enjoy some post walk refreshment at the popular White Eagle public house. The attractive pub includes a patio area with superb views over Caernarfon Bay and the Lleyn Peninsula to Bardsey Island.",
