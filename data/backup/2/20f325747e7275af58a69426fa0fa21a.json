Today it is home to a variety of waterfowl, including a fine flock of canada geese. The Vyne is a National Trust property."

  "description": "Explore the beautiful gardens and grounds surrounding this 16th century Tudor Mansion in Sherborne St John near Basingstoke. In the 18th-century West garden you will find beautiful herbaceous borders, rose beds and wisteria. There is also a pretty walled garden with a restored glasshouse and a summerhouse. The walk then takes you into the wider grounds and through Morgaston Wood with a number of peaceful way-marked paths to follow. There's also a wetlands area with a bird hide where you can look out for Snipe, Great Crested Grebe and Heron. The house was built for Lord Sandys, King Henry VIII's Lord Chamberlain. You can explore the grand rooms which contain a number of decorative and interesting rare artifacts and much of the original Tudor furniture still intact. There is also a wonderful Tudor chapel, with stained glass windows.",

On the southern side of nearby Basingstoke there's the historic area of Old Basing. Here you'll find the 16th century Basing House, a Tudor Tithe Barn, Basingstoke Common and the Basing Lime Pits. There's also some more nice trails along the River Loddon and the Basingstoke Canal Walk in this area. Just south of Old Basing there's also Hackwood Park to explore. The Grade I listed park has a series of public footpaths taking you past the old estate which includes an ornamental bridge, fountains, a statue of George I, deer and the impressive Hackwood House. Just to the east of the park you can pick up the circular Mapledurwell Walk and visit the pretty villages of Mapledurwell and Upton Grey.
