The caves possess an intriguing and mysterious allure, with their walls intricately carved by natural forces such as humidity, salt, and the nearby ocean. Visitors can explore the cave galleries free of charge, as they are open year-round. However, it is advisable to plan a visit on a clear day with calm sea conditions to fully appreciate the natural light illuminating the cave. Otherwise, turbulent seas may detract from the experience."

  "description": "This walk visits the attractive village of Cushendun near Ballycastle in County Antrim. The village's caves are a tourist attraction and are well known globally after featuring in the Game of Thrones TV series. The site formed the backdrop for the Stormlands and was the setting for a some important scenes in season 2 and again in season 8. It's a fine place for a walk with the dramatic cave system and some wonderful views of the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland which lies just 15 miles away over the North Channel. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit Cushendall where there's more excellent coastal paths to try.",
