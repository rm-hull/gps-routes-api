    "description": "This picturesque Cambridgeshire village sits in a nice location on the River Nene, near the border with Northamptonshire. There's woodland trails in a nearby National Nature Reserve and nice riverside paths to enjoy in this area. This circular walk from the village visits the River Nene, Yarwell, Nassington and the Bedford Purlieus National Nature Reserve . The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the Nene Way and follow the waymarked footpath south past Wansford Bridge to Yarwell where there's a mill, lock and weir on the river. The trail continues round to Nassington where you'll pass Nassington Manor before crossing the dismantled railway to the north of the village. The route then heads north along country lanes to visit the Bedford Purlieus National Nature Reserve where there are miles of woodland trails, bluebells, wildflowers and lots of wildlife to look out for. You then head east past the Old Sulehay Forest to return to Wansford.",
