  "description": "This signed off road circular trail takes you on a tour of the peaceful Wareham Forest in Dorset. You will pass through the high forest and open heath of the area with its variety of wildlife. Look out for crossbills and sand lizards as you make your way around this 7 mile circular ride. This trail is suitable for families with older children as the trail is relatively flat but has a couple of climbs. It is signed for its duration and though it is advertised as a cycle trail it is also suitable for walkers. You can start off from the Sika Trail car park located at postcode BH20 7PE. This route links with the Wareham Forest Way. It runs from Wareham to Sturminster Marshall with nice views of the River Frome and the River Piddle Valley. Also nearby are the Hartland Moor and Arne Nature Reserves. Here you will find more nice footpaths with a variety of wildlife to look out for.",
