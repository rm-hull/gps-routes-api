  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll along this small reservoir in Bartley Green, Birmingham. The walk starts from the roadside car parking area at Frankley Beeches. There's a viewpoint with fine views over the countryside and towards Birmingham from here. On a clear day you can see the hills of the Cotswolds, Shropshire and even Wales. There's also a cluster of beeches trees which are a legacy of the Cadbury family, and now cared for by the National Trust. A public footpath can be followed east from here and then south along the south western side of the reservoir. To continue your walking in the area just cross the road to pick up the path around Bartley Reservoir .",
