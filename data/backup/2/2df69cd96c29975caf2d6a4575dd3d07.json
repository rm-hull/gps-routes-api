    "description": "This 400 acre park lies just a couple of miles north of Stockport in the Tame Valley. The park contains a Visitor Centre, Community Orchard and Garden, Butterfly Conservation Field and a Dipping Pond.  There are also peaceful woodland walks, a waterside path along the River Tame and two reservoirs which attract plenty of wildlife. For children there's a farm where you can pet and feed a variety of animals. Both the Trans Pennine Trail and the Midshires Way run through the park. You can follow both these trails on towards Stockport either on a bike or on foot. The park is conveniently located a short distance from Reddish South and Brinnington railway stations. Just to the west you'll find Highfield Country Park in Levenshulme. There's more nice walking trails and a cycle track here.",
