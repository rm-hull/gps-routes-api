  "description": "This 400 acre park lies just a couple of miles north of Stockport in the Tame Valley. The park contains a Visitor Centre, Community Orchard and Garden, Butterfly Conservation Field and a Dipping Pond. There are also peaceful woodland walks, a waterside path along the River Tame and two reservoirs which attract plenty of wildlife. For children there's a farm where you can pet and feed a variety of animals. Both the Trans Pennine Trail and the Midshires Way run through the park. You can follow both these trails on towards Stockport either on a bike or on foot. The park is conveniently located a short distance from Reddish South and Brinnington railway stations. Just to the west you'll find Highfield Country Park in Levenshulme. There's more nice walking trails and a cycle track here.",

      "content": "The Stockport Walk visits the botanic gardens at Fletcher Moss Park in East Didsbury. It starts in the town centre of Stockport and follows the River Mersey for just over 4 miles. Just to the south you can also explore Vernon and Woodbank Park where you can pick up the Etherow Goyt Valley Way and enjoy waterside walks along the River Goyt. Head north along the Tameside Trail and you will soon come to Debdale Park. There's some nice trails around the Gorton Reservoir and lots of water based activities to try here. Heading east along the trail will take you to Haughton Green where you can visit the Haughton Dale Nature Reserve. There's some nice bluebell woods and lots of wildlife to see here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
