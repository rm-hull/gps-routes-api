    "description": "This circular walk climbs to Helman Tor and then visits the adjacent Breney Common Nature Reserve in Bodmin. You can park at the Helman Tor car park just south of the hill to start your walk. It's a short climb from here to the rocky outcrop which stands at a height of 209 m (686 ft). From here there are fabulous views over the surrounding Cornish coutntryside. After descending from the tor the route then follows the Saints Way long distance trail around Breney Common. The reserve covers over 500 acres with heathland, grassland, wetland, woodland and ponds. It's great for widlife with grazing ponies and the rare Orange Tip butterfly to look out for. Various wildfowl can be seen on the open water too. Just to the south of the tor you can explore the popular Luxulyan Valley , a designated World Heritage Site. The valley is one of the highlights of the area with nice trails along the River Par, a series of historical industrial remains and the impressive Treffry Viaduct to see.",
