  "description": "Explore the extensive grounds of this 13th century Augustinian priory on foot or by bike. The National Trust owned site includes a museum with regularly changing art exhibitions. There's also a walled rose garden which is home to the National Collection of ancestral species and 19th-century rose cultivars. There's nice footpaths to follow along the River Test, through woodland and past some lovely wide lawns. You can reach the abbey by following the Test Way from the nearby town of Romsey . It's about a 5 mile walk from the town, passing Squabb Woods and Awbridge Danes Lakes on the way. The riverside, waymarked path also offers the opportunity for further exploring the countryside surrounding the abbey.",
