  "description": "Explore the extensive grounds of this 13th century Augustinian priory on foot or by bike. The National Trust owned site includes a museum with regularly changing art exhibitions. There's also a walled rose garden which is home to the National Collection of ancestral species and 19th-century rose cultivars. There's nice footpaths to follow along the River Test, through woodland and past some lovely wide lawns. You can reach the abbey by following the Test Way from the nearby town of Romsey. It's about a 5 mile walk from the town, passing Squabb Woods and Awbridge Danes Lakes on the way. The riverside, waymarked path also offers the opportunity for further exploring the countryside surrounding the abbey.",

At the Victorian Old Kitchen there's indoor seating within the historic surrounds of the kitchen, or you could take a riverside seat outside on the porch. You could also head half a mile south to the village of Dunbridge and visit the Mill Arms. It's in a lovely spot and includes a new conservatory for looking out over the garden with two open fireplaces indoors for colder days. You can find the pub at Barley Hill, Dunbridge with a postcode of SO51 0LF for your sat navs."
