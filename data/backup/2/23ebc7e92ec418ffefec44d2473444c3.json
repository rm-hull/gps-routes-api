  "description": "This walk or cycle takes you along a dismantled railway line and National Cycle Route 76 between the East Lothian towns of Haddington and Longniddry. The route runs for about 5 miles along a nice flat path so suitable for most abilities. The line was originally opened in 1846 but closed in 1949 with the emergence of the motor car. The trail starts on the western side of Haddington where there is a public car park near to the East Lothian Community Hospital. You then head north west passing Merryhatton Cottages, the Cotty Burn and Setonhill Wood before coming into Longniddry where the route finishes at the train station. To extend the walk you can head to the coast at Longniddry and enjoy a stroll along Gosford Sands and Seton Sands to Cockenzie and Port Seton. The Hopetoun Monument is also visible from the trail and can be climbed for fine views of the area.",

The Haddington to East Linton Walk also starts in Haddington. It will take you to neighbouring East Linton along the River Tyne, passing the delightful Amisfield Walled Garden, the fine viewpoint at Traprain Law and the historic ruins of Hailes Castle on the way. To the south west you'll find similar trails on the Pencaitland Railway Walk and the Penicuik to Dalkeith Railway Walk. Dunbar is not far so you could head east to try the Dunbar Cliff Walk, the Dunbar to North Berwick Walk or visit the woodland trails at Pressmennan Wood. John Muir Country Park and the John Muir Way are also not far away. For more walks in the area see the Edinburgh Walks page."
