Situated atop a dramatic hill, the visitor centre commands striking views of Cardigan Bay and the Cambrian Mountains, straddling the boundary between the lowlands and uplands. While exploring the trails, visitors can still observe remnants of the historic lead mining industry. Nowadays, the hills are adorned with bilberry and heather, while majestic red kites soar gracefully above."

    "description": "This large forest near Aberystwyth has a series of good mountain bike trails and miles of good footpaths for walkers. The forest has a good sized car park and visitor centre just off the A44 between Goginan and Ponterwyd. From here you can pick up the mtb trails heading north into the forest. There's two red grade and two black grade trails of varying lengths. These include technical singletrack descents and long climbs with more details on the open street map link and more information link below. If you're on foot then there's nice paths around the two ponds located just to the east of the car park. There's also miles of bridleways and footpaths to the north of the car park. Some of the trails are quite challenging with a climb to Mynydd March in the northern section. From the high points there are stunning views to the Welsh Mountains. There's also a number of large ponds which are in really lovely remote spots. The forest has a number of bird hides and is well known as a great place to watch red kites. There's also a nice cafe where you can refresh yourself after your exercise. To extend your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Devil's Bridge Falls. The spectacular falls include the imposing Jacob's Ladder stone steps and some wonderful scenery. A few miles north you'll find Nant-y-moch Reservoir where there's a nice waterside trail to try.",
