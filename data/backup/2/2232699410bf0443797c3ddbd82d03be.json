  "description": "These pretty little Pembrokeshire village is located in a fine spot on the western side of the River Cleddau estuary near Haverfordwest. This walk takes you along the Llangwm Pill where you can enjoy some lovely views across the estuary to Lawrenny Quay and the Daugleddau River on the other side. The estuary is also great for wildlife watching with a variety of birds to look out for. You can extend the walk by continuing south into Benton Woods where there are some peaceful woodland trails. To the north there are more nice views around Black Tar point. To continue your walking in the area head north to visit the National Trust's Little Milford. There's some pleasant walking trails here around ancient woodland with more river views to enjoy.",
