  "description": "This Devon based market town is close to both the Exmoor and Dartmoor National Parks. This walk from the town visits the viaduct at Derriton just to the south east of the settlement. It then goes on to visit the Coles Mill Viaduct. The walk starts at the tourist information centre and heads south west through the town to the viaduct. You can then follow a cycle and walking path over the viaduct which crosses the River Deer. You can then head back east to visit the Coles Mill Viaduct which lies just south of the town.",

There's also outdoor seating if the weather is favourable. You can find them at postcode EX22 7HU. They are also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."

      "content": "Head south east of the town and there's some nice woodland trails around Cookworthy Forest. The old rail line also runs through this area which is popular with dog walkers. Holsworthy Woods are located just to the south of the town. Head north and you can enjoy waterside walking around the lovely Tamar Lakes. Beyond that is the Hartland area where you can pick up the Hartland Point and Hartland Quay walks. South of Hartland Quay you'll find another local coastal highlight at Morwenstow. The area is run by the National Trust and includes some fine cliff top trails. It's also historically significant with a thousand year old church, a 14th century farm and the noteworthy Hawker's Hut. This unusual structure sits in a photogenic spot and was built using driftwood by local vicar and poet Rev. Robert Stephen Hawker. For cyclists National Cycle Route 3 runs through the area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Exmoor Walks and Dartmoor Walks pages."
