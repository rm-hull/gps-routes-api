    "description": "This Devon based market town is close to both the Exmoor and Dartmoor National Parks. This walk from the town visits the viaduct at Derriton just to the south east of the settlement. It then goes on to visit the Coles Mill Viaduct. The walk starts at the tourist information centre and heads south west through the town to the viaduct. You can then follow a cycle and walking path over the viaduct which crosses the River Deer. You can then head back east to visit the Coles Mill Viaduct which lies just south of the town.",
