  "description": "These woods in central Bedfordshire have some good walking trails to try. In the peaceful woods you will find lots of flora and fauna with pretty bluebells in the spring and a variety of woodland birds. You can start your walk from Appley Corner where there is some parking available. Then follow the Long Drive south west through the centre of the woods. This nice wide track includes a monument to Lord Halifax. At Pedley Wood you can pick up the Greensand Ridge Walk long distance trail to take you back to Appley Corner. It's easy to extend your walk if you have time. Just continue south west along the Greensand Ridge Walk to Clophill where you will find Maulden Woods. Here you will find more walking trails taking you through semi-natural broadleaf woodland, acidic grassland and conifer plantations. At the Appley Corner end of the woods you can pick up the John Bunyan Trail and follow it a short distance to Rowney Warren Wood near Shefford. The large coniferous woodland has lots of footpaths, a BMX trail and a mountain bike trail. It includes the excellent Chicksands Bike Park which has a range of courses for all abilities.",
