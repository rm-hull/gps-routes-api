  "description": "These woods in central Bedfordshire have some good walking trails to try. In the peaceful woods you will find lots of flora and fauna with pretty bluebells in the spring and a variety of woodland birds. You can start your walk from Appley Corner where there is some parking available. Then follow the Long Drive south west through the centre of the woods. This nice wide track includes a monument to Lord Halifax. At Pedley Wood you can pick up the Greensand Ridge Walk long distance trail to take you back to Appley Corner. It's easy to extend your walk if you have time. Just continue south west along the Greensand Ridge Walk to Clophill where you will find Maulden Woods. Here you will find more walking trails taking you through semi-natural broadleaf woodland, acidic grassland and conifer plantations. At the Appley Corner end of the woods you can pick up the John Bunyan Trail and follow it a short distance to Rowney Warren Wood near Shefford. The large coniferous woodland has lots of footpaths, a BMX trail and a mountain bike trail. It includes the excellent Chicksands Bike Park which has a range of courses for all abilities.",

      "content": "The Stone Jug in the nearby village of Clophill is a fine place to go for some post walk refreshments. It's a place of some historic note having been converted to a pub from a 16th century building. It's name may have something to do with the local quarry stone which the building is mostly constructed from. The pub is nestled on a quiet rural lane has a rear decking area which in the summer months catches all the afternoon and early evening sun - perfect for a relaxing sit down. During the colder months you can sip a mulled wine and relax in the attractive interior beside one of the many fires. You can find the pub in the village at 10 Back St with a postcode of MK45 4BY for your sat navs."

      "content": "Near to Clophill you will find the interesting Cainhoe Castle which is worth a visit if you have time. The hill is the site of the a former 11th-century Norman castle but today only the turf-covered mound remains, with earthwork banks outlining the bailey enclosure. It's a nice climb to the top though and there are good views of the surrounding countryside from the elevated position of the site. There is a public footpath from the High Street in Clophill, opposite Town Shott, heading east out to the castle. The field has permissive access, so visitors can explore freely. The Clophill and Haynes Circular Walk starts in the nearby village and explores the local countryside, with a visit to the woods on the way. Just to the south of Clophill there's Silsoe where you can enjoy easy trails around Wrest Park. There's 92 acres of landscaped early eighteenth-century gardens to explore here. You can also enjoy a pleasant stroll around Silsoe village where there are a number of historic properties associated with the park estate. For more walking ideas in the area see the Bedfordshire Walks page."
