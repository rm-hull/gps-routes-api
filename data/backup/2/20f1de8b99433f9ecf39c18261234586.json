  "description": "This is a delightful walk along the River Ivel from Baldock to Roxton. You start off at the source of the river at Ivel springs, Baldock, and follow the river north through Stotfold, Henlow, Langford, Biggleswade, Sandy and Blunham. Walk highlights are the series of pretty, riverside villages with historic churches and watermills.  Wildlife lovers will enjoy the Henlow Common and Langford Meadow Nature Reserve at Langford. This 50 acre reserve is home to a variety of wildlife and consists of grassland, scrubland, native trees, bushes and a running stream. Also of interest is the Warren Villas Nature Reserve where there is also a plethora of water loving wildlife. The reserve features an island lake, home to wintering wildfowl and in summer breeding terns. The reserve is on route and situated just to the north of Biggleswade. Other highlights include the 17th century Henlow Grange and park which is now used as a health and beauty farm visited by the rich and famous.",
