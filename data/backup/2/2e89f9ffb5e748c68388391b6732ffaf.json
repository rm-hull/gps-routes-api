  "description": "This walk visits Lough Curra in the Galty Mountains area of County Tipperary. You can start the walk from the parking area at Glengarra Wood which lies just to the north of the lough. Then pick up the woodland trails heading south to the small clear lough. It's a lovely tranquil spot with the lake surrounded by steep hills and moorland. Just to the south east there's Galtymore Mountain, another popular climb in the area. From here there are splendid views back down to the lake and surrounding mountains. The area is great for wildlife with birds such as kestrels to look out for on the way. For more lake views in the area head east to visit Lake Muskry .",

      "content": "Just to the east is the historic Cahir Castle. The 12th century castle is well worth a visit with lovely grounds and a fascinating history. You can also pick up the Suir Blueway here. The riverside cycling and walking trail runs along the River Suir from Carrick-on-Suir to Clonmel. To the north west there's more lakeside trails at Lough Gur to explore. The photogenic horseshoe-shaped lake includes walking trails, picnic areas and ancient sites of historical and archeological interest. To the south east is the beautiful Bay Lough. The remote Corrie Lake is located at the The Vee in the Knockmealdown Mountain range, a popular local area for hiking. To the south east you'll find Glengarra Woods where there are two waymarked trails, specimen trees and fine views of the Burncourt River. To the north there's a popular loop walk around the Glen Of Aherlow where you'll find some stunning scenery and peaceful woodland trails."
