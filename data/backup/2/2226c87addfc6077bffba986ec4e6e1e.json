  "description": "This circular walk visits the Litton Reservoirs in the village of Litton in the Mendip Hills area of Somerset. You can start the walk in the village and then follow footpaths north along the River Chew to reach the two pretty lakes. Footpaths and country lanes can then be followed around the site, passing Coley and Sherborne before returning to the village. It's a picturesque area with an impressive dam and attractive woodland surrounding the water. The area is good for flora and fauna with Violets, Primroses, Bluebell, Wood anemone and Campion among the plant species. Look out for Tufted duck, Swans, Mallards, Coot and Moorhen on the water.",

The long distance Limestone Link can also be picked up just to the north. Just to the west is the neighbouring village of Compton Martin. Here you will find a noteworthy Norman church, an historic 16th century pub and the picturesque millpond which is the source of the Congresbury Yeo River. Just south of here there's also East Harptree Woods to explore. There's some peaceful woodland trails and the photogenic Smitham Chimney to visit here. In the nearby village of East Harptree there's also a fine 16th century pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Mendip Hills Walks page."
