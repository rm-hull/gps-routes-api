  "description": "An easy waterside walk along a nice section of the Llangollen Canal from Chirk to Llangollen. The route runs for a distance of just over 9 miles, passing the iconic Pontcysyllte Aqueduct along the way. The walk starts on the canal next to Chirk railway station. You follow the towpath north to the pretty Chirk Marina where you can see lots of boats moored. The route continues north to the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct which you cross over the River Dee. The early 19th century structure is the longest and highest aqueduct in Britain. There's a handy information point nearby where you can learn all about the history of the aqueduct. The canal then turns west to head through the beautiful Vale of Llangollen, passing Trevor before coming into the finish point in the town. To extend your walking in the area you could visit the 13th century Chirk Castle which is located just to the west of Chirk at the start of the route. The castle has award-winning gardens and a 460 acre estate to explore so is well worth the small detour from the canal. You could also try the Panorama Walk which will take you up to the lovely World's End. The attractive gorge is a great place for a walk with pretty streams, little waterfalls and attractive woodland.",

There are some glorious views over the River Ceiriog Valley from the top of the elevated structure. Crossing the aqueduct will take you across the border into England. To the west of Chirk you can visit the villages of Glyn Ceiriog and Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog where you can explore the beautiful Upper Ceiriog Valley. The splendid Berwyn Mountains can also be explored on the North Berwyn Way in this area."
