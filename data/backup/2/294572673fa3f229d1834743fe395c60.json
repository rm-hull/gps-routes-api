  "description": "This Denbighshire based village sits a few miles south of Corwen in the Berwyn Mountains. It's a very pretty village with several listed buildings and views of the River Dee. Llandrillo makes a great base for exploring the Berwyn Mountains with many footpaths to try and a fine 18th century inn to stay at. This challenging circular walk from the village takes you to some of the highlights of the area. On the route you will climb to Moel Pearce, Cadair Bronwen and the famous Cadair Berwyn, the highest point in the Berwyn Mountains range. The opening section also passes the ancient Moel Ty Uchaf stone circle which lies just east of the village. At the southern end of the route there's also an optional extension to another major local highlight at Pistyll Rhaeadr. The spectacular 240-foot (73 m) waterfall is regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of Wales.",
