  "description": "This Surrey based village has several local areas of common land which are ideal for walkers. There's woodland, heathland, ponds and some attractive countryside to explore in the immediate vicinity of the settlement. Oxshott is often referred to as the \"most expensive village in England\" being home to several premier league footballers including former Liverpool player Jamie Redknapp. Two time Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray is also a resident here. This walk from the village visits Oxshott Heath and Woods, Esher Common and Fairmile Common. There's a network of good walking trails on the commons with lots of interesting flora and fauna to see on the way. The walk starts from Oxshott train station which is located right next to the heath. From here you head north west across the heath before turning north to explore Esher Common. Just to the north of the common you have the option of extending the walk by visiting the adjacent Claremont Park. Here you'll find a picturesque lake, wide lawns and an unusual turfed amphitheatre. This route circles the common before heading south west to visit Fairmile Common. There's another pretty pond and more woodland trails here. From the common you head east through Fairmile to return to the train station.",
