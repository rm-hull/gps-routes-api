  "description": "Robinswood Hill country park is located in Gloucester, just to the south of the city centre. The walk explores the 250 acres of park which includes a Local Nature Reserve, an orchard, Robin's Wood Hill Quarry (a Site of Special Scientific Interest) and a dry ski slope. From the 650 ft (198 m) top of Robinswood Hill there are spectacular views of the surrounding area including the Cotswolds, the Malvern Hills, May Hill, the city of Gloucester and on a clear day the Severn Bridges. There's several colour coded walking trails to try including the Fox Trail through the woodland and the Geology trail to the quarry. The area is also great for wildlife with foxes, badgers and red kites to look out for in the skies above.",
