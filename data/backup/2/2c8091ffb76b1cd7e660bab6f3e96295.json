  "description": "The Brockhampton Estate in Herefordshire has a number of excellent waymarked walking trails to follow. The trails take you through large areas of ancient oak woodland with oak carved sculptures to look out for on the way. There are also waterside paths around the small lake and along the pretty stream. Look out for a variety of wildlife including buzzard, heron, woodpecker, and nuthatch. The estate covers 1,700 acres so you can extend your walk and visit the relaxing orchards and the 14th century moated manor house. There's also acres of farmland with Hereford cattle and Ryeland sheep. It's easy to further extend your walk by heading to the nearby Bringsty Common. It's right next to the estate and consists of miles of lovely footpaths with great views towards the Malvern Hills. You could also pick up the Worcestershire Way in Knightwick and explore the Suckley Hills and the River Teme valley.",
