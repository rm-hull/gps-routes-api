    "description": "Visit the largest oak tree in the New Forest on this short, accessible walk. You start off at the Knightwood Oak car park and follow a nice gravel path to the impressive tree. It's over 500 years old, has a girth of 7.38 metres (24.2 ft) and is still growing! The Knightwood Oak trail is located just a few miles west of Lyndhurst. You could extend your walk by trying the New Forest Reptile Centre Trail which is less than a mile away. You could follow our Lyndhurst Circular Walk to visit the centre and the lovely Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary .",
