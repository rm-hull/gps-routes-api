  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Moray Coast Trail from Hopeman to Lossiemouth. The walk runs for just over 6 miles on a mainly flat path. On the way there are beautiful beaches, picturesque coves and fine cliff tops views to enjoy. The walk starts from the car park next to the beach in Hopeman. From here you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it east towards the gold course at Covesea, passing the old quarries and the picturesque Clashach Cove on the way. You then head along Moray Golf Course before passing Stotfield and arriving in Lossiemouth. You can extend your exercise on the Lossiemouth to Spey Bay Walk which continues east along the coast path to the nature reserve at Spey Bay. Here you can look out for lots of wildlife including a variety of wildfowl and even dolphins. You could also head west on the Hopeman to Burghead Walk via Cummingston and St Aethans.",
