  "description": "Visit this classic chalk escarpment in the Chilterns and enjoy wonderful views across this beautiful area. This circular walk makes use of the John Bunyan Trail and the Icknield Way Path to take you on a tour of the Sharpenhoe Clappers and the Smithcombe Hills. There's a degree of climbing involved with the route hitting a peak of just over 500ft at the high points. You can park at the Sharpenhoe Clappers car park on Sharpenhoe Road to start your walk. Then head north towards the Iron Age Hill Fort and beech wood which sits atop the area. In the summer months the chalk grasslands are covered in pretty wildflowers which attract a variety of butterflies. Look out for orchids, primroses and an uncommon rose, Rosa stylosa, found in scrub areas. After exploring the hill fort you can head south through the Smithcombe Valley along the Icknield Way Path . You'll pass Smithcombe hill as you make your way to the village of Streatley. From Streatley you pick up the John Bunyan Trail to take you back to the car park. There's lots of good options for extending your walking in the area. Just to the east is the lovely Barton Hills National Nature Reserve where there's lots more interesting flora and fauna to see. Just to the west is Sundon Hills Country Park with lots more walking trails and great views to enjoy. The Toddington Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the park before heading to Sharpenhoe.",
