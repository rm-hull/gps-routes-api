By the 16th century trade was mainly in pilchards, reaching a high point in the 19th century. In 1850 there were 49 fishing boats based here. When I was a child in the 1960s, this was a quiet place where us local Cornish people came to get away from the crowds, but no longer! The Doc Martin series has made it even more popular"

    "description": "This picturesque Cornish village will be familiar to viewers of ITV's 'Doc Martin' show with Martin Clunes. The little fishing village includes a delightful harbour surrounded by cliffs and countryside made famous in the TV show. There's also a number of winding narrow streets with interesting 18th century cottages to see. This circular walk takes you from the village along the coast to the nearby Port Quin. It's a popular walk, taking place on an undulating path with lots of little coves and fine views of Port Quin Bay to enjoy on the way. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it north along The Haven to Lobber Point. You then head west past Pine Haven, Varley Head, Greengarden Cove, Scarnor Point, Downgate Cove and Kellan Head before arriving at Port Quin. If you head a little further up the coast you can visit the 19th century folly of Doyden Castle where there are fine views back down to the bay. The route then returns to Port Isaac by following and inland footpath east past Roscarrock.",
