With thanks to John Trimmer for the following additional information: \"This pub is on a Drover's route and would have been frequented by the Welsh Drovers in the 16th and 17th centuries, when moving their cattle down to London from Kent. The Three Horseshoes is the heraldic sign of the Worshipful Company of Farriers, suggesting a nearby forge. The pound would have been used to corral the cattle at night. The Bull at Pratts Bottom (Spratts Bottom on the 1810 map), would also have been a stop-over point.\" For a photo of the Bull at Pratts Bottom (presumably the Bulls Head)."

  "description": "This route from Knockholt Pound uses sections of the North Downs Way and the Pilgrims Way to create a circular walk through the area. There's fine views from the elevated position of the area and you'll also pass the noteworthy Chevening House on the route. The walk starts in Knockholt Pound and heads south past Lees Wood to link up with the ancient Pilgrims Way trail at Morants Court Farm. You then head west past Chevening House and Hagbush Wood before coming to Hogtrough Hill. The Grade I listed house was built between 1617 and 1630 to a design reputedly by Inigo Jones. It is often inhabited by a prominent member of ruling government and sometimes by the prime minister. At Hogtrough Hill you turn north to link up with a country lane to take you to the North Downs Way. The waymarked footpath will take you north east to Knockholt village. After exploring the village you return to the trail and continue east through a woodland area to return to Knockholt Pound.",
