    "description": "This splendid walk and cycle path runs along a former railway line that used to transport strawberries from Cheddar. You start by Yatton railway station and head south passing Congresbury and Axbridge before finishing in Cheddar. The route passes apple orchards, open fields and the River Yeo while there are also pleasant woodland sections at King's Wood and Rose Wood. Also on the route is the delightful Millennium Green at Winscombe (perfect place to stop for lunch!) and the tranquil Cheddar Reservoir at the end of the route. If you have time you could continue up to the magnificent Cheddar Gorge and see this spectacular natural wonder. Axbridge is also well worth exploring with its medieval town square, half timbered buildings and the Tudor King John's Hunting Lodge which houses a fine local museum. The route is part of National Cycle Route 26 which runs from Portishead in Somerset to the Isle of Portland on the south coast of Dorset. You can extend your outing on this signed Sustrans path if you have time.",
