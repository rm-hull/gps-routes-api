At the site there's riverside trails along the Lea Valley Walk, lakes, reedbeds, grassland and woodland to explore. There's an abundance of wildlife with bittern, widgeon, gadwall, shoveler, goldeneye  and dragonflies to look out for. You can start the walk from the public car park at Stanstead Lock and then follow the River Lea into the reserve. The New River Path also runs through the reserve so you can continue your walk along this pleasant waterway.",
