  "description": "This delightful village is located on the River Test in Hampshire. There's picturesque thatched cottages, old mills, weirs, pretty lakes and a fine old pub to visit here. This walk from the village takes you along a section of the Test Way to Harewood Forest, Wherwell and Chilbolton. The walk starts in the village and heads south west to neighbouring Middleton where you can pick up the Test Way and follow the waymarked footpath along the river to Forton. At Gavelacre you leave the river to head into the expansive Harewood Forest where there are miles of peaceful woodland trails to explore. The trail heads through the forest before coming to Wherwell. The route then crosses the river to head south into Chilbolton. Here you'll find the picturesque Chilbolton Common where there are some pretty old thatch cottages to see.",
