However coastal erosion has meant that most of it has fallen in to the sea. The coastline has advanced around half a mile inland over the past 800 years. A museum further down this street tells all about the town."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Dunwich to Walkberswick on the Suffolk coast. The route runs for just under 7 mile using an inland trail for the first section before returning along the beach. The route takes place on flat paths so is suitable for most abilities. The walk starts in the pretty little village of Dunwich where there is a public car park. From here you can pick up the waymarked Suffolk Coast Path and follow it north past Dunwich Forest, Dingle Marshes, Westwood Marshes and the Walberswick Nature Reserve. You then pick up a nice waterside section along the Dunwich River to take you into Walberswick. After exploring the village the route returns to Dunwich along the beach.",
