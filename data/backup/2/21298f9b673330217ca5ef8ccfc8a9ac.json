However coastal erosion has meant that most of it has fallen in to the sea. The coastline has advanced around half a mile inland over the past 800 years. A museum further down this street tells all about the town."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Dunwich to Walkberswick on the Suffolk coast. The route runs for just under 7 mile using an inland trail for the first section before returning along the beach. The route takes place on flat paths so is suitable for most abilities. The walk starts in the pretty little village of Dunwich where there is a public car park. From here you can pick up the waymarked Suffolk Coast Path and follow it north past Dunwich Forest, Dingle Marshes, Westwood Marshes and the Walberswick Nature Reserve. You then pick up a nice waterside section along the Dunwich River to take you into Walberswick. After exploring the village the route returns to Dunwich along the beach.",

You can find the pub at a postcode of IP18 6UA for your sat navs. Back in Dunwich there's the Ship. Here there's another lovely garden area and a very good menu. The interior is also charming with lots of sea prints on the wall and a woodburner to keep you warm on winter days. You can find the pub at postcode IP17 3DT."

      "content": "To extend your walk you could continue on to the pretty town of Southwold on the Southwold to Walberswick Walk. You would head north along the Suffolk Coast Path, crossing the river on the ferry to get to Southwold. The expansive Dunwich Heath is also nearby and has miles of trails to try. The circular Blythburgh Walk starts at the nearby village and visits the Westwood Marshes, Walberswick and Dunwich Forest. The village is located just to the north west of Walberswick and includes trails along the River Blyth and a noteworthy 14th century church which is lit at night. There's also a notable 16th century pub with an excellent garden area overlooking the estuary. If you followed the Blyth river west from the settlement you will soon come to the neighbouring town of Halesworth. This town has some interesting history with a walk down the central Thoroughfare highly recommended. The pedestrianised area includes many buildings dating back to the sixteenth century. For more walking ideas in the area see the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Walks and the Suffolk Walks pages."
