  "description": "This walk explores the Rosehaugh House Estate near Avoch on the south-east coast of the Black Isle, on the Moray Firth. The estate is located inland a couple of miles west of the village. The expansive estate includes peaceful woodland trails, a boating lake, waterside trails along the the Killen Burn and the ruins of the old house. There's also lots of flora and fauna with many woodland birds to listen for and look out for on the estate. From the high points there are also glorious views over the surrounding countryside. The boathouse by the lake can also be hired out as holiday accommodation.",
