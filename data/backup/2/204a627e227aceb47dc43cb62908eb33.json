  "description": "This walk visits Martinshaw\u00a0Wood in the National Forest near Groby and the city of Leicester. You can start the walk from the car park near the M1, about a mile west of Groby. The walk then crosses a bridge over the motorway to access the trails on the eastern side of the woods. There's hundreds of acres to explore on a network of paths suitable for both walkers and cyclists. The woods are also great for wildlife with goldcrest, woodcock and woodpeckers to look out for on the walk. You can continue your walking in the area by heading a short distance north east to visit the pretty Groby Pool .",
