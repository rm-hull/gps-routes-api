  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll through the ancient woodland and open grassland of the Hucking Estate in the Kent Downs AONB. Waymarked walking trails will take you along well surfaced paths with scupltures and fantastic views over the surrounding countryside. Spring is a great time for this walk as you will find a carpet of pretty bluebells in the delightful woodland glades.  Free parking is available on Church Road, where this circular walk starts and finishes. If you'd like to extend your walk then you could follow the North Downs Way to the nearby White Horse Wood Country Park for more walking trails with great views. It is located about 2.5 miles to the west. The Hucking Estate is located a few miles north east of Maidstone where you can enjoy some pleasant riverside walks.",
