  "description": "This walking route runs from Pett Level to Seabrook along the Royal Military Canal. Constructed in the early 19th century as a defence against a possible invasion by Napoleon, the canal-side path now makes for a nice easy walk. The route starts off on the coast at Pett Level and heads inland towards Winchelsea and then onto Rye. The path then heads to Hythe via Appledore before finishing at Seabrook just outside Hythe. Highlights on the route include the lovely Rye Harbour Nature Reserve near Rye. The reserve includes saltmarsh, lagoons, grazing marsh, shingle and reedbeds. You can also visit the ruins of Henry VIII's Camber Castle . The Device Fort was built to protect the\u00a0Sussex\u00a0coast against French attack in the 16th century. You'll also pass Lympne where there's the splendid Port Lympne Wild Animal Park , the medieval Lympne Castle and the interesting Portus Lemanis Roman Fort. Winchelsea is also a fine place for a stroll with a series of interesting medieval buildings and a splendid old museum.",
