    "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Lough Gur in County Limerick near Herbertstown. The peaceful, horseshoe-shaped lake includes walking trails, picnic areas and sites of archeological interest. You can start your walk from the visitor centre and car park at the northern end of the lake. In the visitor centre there's an interactive multimedia exhibition that brings to life over 6,000 years of archaeology and history. Near here you can also visit the ruins of Bourchier's Castle, named after Sir George Bourchier, the son of the second Earl of Bath. From the car park there are walking paths taking you to the lake and woodland. The area is of historical interest too with the Grange stone circle on the western side of the lake. The ancient site is significant as the largest stone circle in Ireland.",
