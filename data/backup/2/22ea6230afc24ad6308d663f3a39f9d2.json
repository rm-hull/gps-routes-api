    "description": "Follow the River Dee from England into Wales on this easy waterside walk or cycle. The route starts on the England and Wales border at Chester and follows a good riverside path to Connah's Quay in Wales. You'll pass Saltney Bridge and Queensferry Bridge before finishing at Hawarden Bridge at Connah's Quay. It's a good surfaced path which is great for cyclists looking for a safe, traffic free ride. It runs along National Cycle Route 568 with nice views of the surrounding countryside. Near the end of the route you'll find the delightful Wepre Park. You could extend your exercise by exploring the 160 acre country park with its river, waterfall and the 12th century ruins of Ewloe Castle. Also nearby is the fascinating ruins of Flint Castle with views over the Dee Estuary. In Chester you can explore the city on the Chester Walls Walk. There's much to enjoy with more views of the River Dee and a visit to a number of interesting historical sites. To turn it into a circular route you could pick up the Chester Millennium Greenway. This popular traffic free ride takes you along a disused railway line from Connah's Quay to Mickle Trafford.",
