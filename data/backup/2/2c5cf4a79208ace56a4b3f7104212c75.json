  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle along this disused railway line which now forms part of National Cycle Network Route 51. It's now a great traffic free tarmac path following the route of the new Cambridgeshire Guided Busway which connects Cambridge, Huntingdon and St Ives. It runs just alongside the busway starting near the Cambridge Science Park just north of the city centre. You then head west passing Histon and the lovely Fen Drayton Lakes. The reserve has a number of lakes, ponds and lagoons with the River Great Ouse running through it as well. Shortly after you arrive at the market town of St Ives where the route finishes. You have the option of continuing along route 51 to Huntingdon which is just a few miles to the west. It's a nice flat, safe route which is ideal for families or anybody looking for an easy cycle ride or pleasant stroll. Along the way there's great views of the surrounding Cambridgeshire countryside.",

Here you'll find pleasant walks along the River Rhee, rows of quaint thatched cottages, a church dating back to the 12th century and a noteworthy Tudor Manor House where Queen Elizabeth I stayed during the 16th century. Near here there's also the new settlement of Cambourne. There's some pleasant walks around this modern village with a lovely local nature reserve to explore. The wildlife rich reserve includes pretty lakes, wildflower meadows and wetland areas. On the walk you can also visit the ancient Bourn Windmill, the oldest surviving windmill in the United Kingdom. Just to the south there's also the stunning gardens at the historic Wimpole Hall."
