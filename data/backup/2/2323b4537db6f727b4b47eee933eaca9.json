    "description": "This Devon based town is located near Exeter in the vale of the River Creedy and River Yeo. This circular walk in the town visits Newcombe's Meadow park before heading down to the River Yeo which flows to the south of the town. The walk starts off at Newcombe's Meadow where there is a pleasant park with surfaced footpaths. There are wide lawns and pretty flower beds to enjoy in these public pleasure grounds. It is also home to the Town's St Boniface Statue and the Town Bandstand. The walk then takes you west along the High Street before turning south across the fields to visit the River Yeo. There's some nice riverside footpaths and great countryside views of the Yeo Valley here.",
