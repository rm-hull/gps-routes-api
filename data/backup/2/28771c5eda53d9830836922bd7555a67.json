The reason for its location away from the quarries was the presence of plentiful water power. The mill operated until the early 1920s, although by then Moel Fferna Quarry had had its own on-site mill since 1911. The Nant y Pandy site had a number of buildings and structures - a mill, a 40' water wheel, a forge, an office and stables."

  "description": "This walk takes you along the delightful Nant Y Pandy in the village of Glyndyfrdwy, Denbighshire. There are footpaths heading south from the village along the scenic little river. It's a lovely spot with the woooded gorge of the peaceful river and the ruins of the old mill to see on the way. There's also great views of the surrounding countryside of the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley AONB. A cycle trail runs just to the east of the walking paths as well. The trail can then be followed into the Ceiriog Forest and the neighbouring settlement of Glyn Ceiriog . Here you can enjoy more riverside walks along the Upper Ceiriog Trail and the Llwybr Ceiriog Trail .",
