  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty lake in Leeds. There's a nice surfaced footpath running around the perimeter of the tarn for just under a mile. Look out for various water loving birds on the water. The Leeds Country Way long distance footpath runs through nearby Horsforth so you can pick this up to extend your walk. A public footpath runs from Yeadon past Horsforth Golf Club and Leeds Bradford Airport to Scotland where you can pick up the Leeds Country Way. It runs east to Golden Acre Park where there are more good walking trails in lovely surroundings.",
