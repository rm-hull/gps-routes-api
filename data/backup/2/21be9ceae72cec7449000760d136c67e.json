It has a 14C steeple of unusual outline, having an octagonal stage between the pinnacles and the spire. The church was thoroughly restored in 1850 after being damaged by lightning in 1843, and has had a Victorian appearance although 13C work is incorporated. There is an important collection of monuments from the 14C to the 18C, possibly the most beautiful being a recumbent sculpture of Anne, wife of Lord Bruce of Kinross, d.1627."

  "description": "This Rutland based village has some pleasant trails to follow through the parkland of the historic Exton Hall. There's also a particularly fine 17th century pub for rest and refreshment after your exercise. This circular walk from the village takes you through Exton Park to visit Fort Henry Lake. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Viking Way. Follow the waymarked footpath north east and it will take you to Tunneley Wood in Exton Park. Here you can pick up a bridle track and follow it south east to visit the two pretty lakes at Fort Henry. The route then follows an alternative bridleway back to the village. The flat bridle paths on the trail are ideal for easy walking with some pleasant farmland views to enjoy on the walk. To extend your walk follow the Viking Way south to visit Rutland Water. There's miles of great cycling and walking trails around the expansive lake which is one of the highlights of the county.",
