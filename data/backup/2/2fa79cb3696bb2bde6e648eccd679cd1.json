    "description": "This coastal village in Lincolnshire has some fine blue flag beaches to explore. It's also close to the Lincolnshire Wolds where there are miles of trails to choose from. This walk from the village takes you south along the England Coast Path to visit Sandilands, Anderby Creek and Chapel St Leonards. It's a pleasant stretch of flat coast with nice beaches, pretty coastal villages and good sea views. The walk starts from the public car park on the sea front. You then head south along the sea defence wall passing the Sandiland Golf Course and Hufton Bank before coming to Anderby Creek. The final section passes Wolla Bank and Chapel Six Marshes before coming into Chapel St Leonards. You can extend the walk by continuing south to Ingoldmells and the popular resort of Skegness .",
