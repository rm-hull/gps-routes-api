Now management has passed to Essex Wildlife Trust and the Friends of Tiptree Heath. It is an important wildlife area for both plants and animals. The 25-hectare heath is the largest surviving fragment of heathland in Essex and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Noteable flora found on the heath include Cross-leaved Heather (Erica tetralix), Bell Heather (Erica cinerea) and Ling or Common Heather (Calluna). To help maintain the heath, Dexter cattle are grazed there during the summer and a herd of 8 hardy Exmoor ponies throughout the year."

    "description": "This large village is located near Colchester in Essex. This walk explores the Tiptree Heath Nature Reserve before heading to the woodland and countryside to the east of the settlement. The walk starts from the car park at Tiptree Heath. There's some nice footpaths across the heath with interesting flora and fauna to look out for on the way. After exploring the heath you head north east to Tiptree Quarry before passing through the town. The route then heads to the Rampart, a scheduled ancient monument with some unusual gnarled trees. Around here you can also pick up some woodland trails through the adjacent Pods Wood. The village includes a small park at Grove Road Lake, just to the north of the centre, off Church Road. It's a pretty place for a short stroll in the area.",
