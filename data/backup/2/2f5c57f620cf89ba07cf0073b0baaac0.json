  "description": "This lovely nature reserve in Harlow has a 1.5km nature trail to try. It's located on the southern outskirts of the town and consists of ancient woodland, 3 bird watching hides, a large pond and a conservation centre. It's great for wildlife with deer, squirrels, and various woodland birds to look out for. You can enjoy refreshments in the centre after your walk. Two long distance walking trails run past the reserve. You can pick up the Forest Way and the Stort Valley Way to further explore the area. For example you could follow the trail south west and visit Epping Forest and Waltham Abbey.",
