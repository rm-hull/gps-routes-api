  "description": "This pretty area of common land near Haywards Heath has a series of nice footpaths to try. You can start the walk from the car park on Warrs Hill Lane next to Red House Common. From here there's nice trails heading south west mast the Old Heritage Windmill. You can then continue across the A272 to Pound Common and Chailey Common where there's a nature reserve with wildlife and wildflowers to look out for. You can see lots of Bell and Cross-Leaved Heather with birds such as Nightjar, Stonechat, Yellowhammer and Linnet regular winged visitors. The long distance Sussex Border Path runs just to the east of the common. You could follow it north for views of the River Ouse. The beautiful Sheffield Park is located just to the north east of the site. There's well laid out footpaths with lovely gardens and water features to see here.",
