  "description": "This is the shortest route to the summit of Mount Keen, the most easterly of the Scottish Munros. It starts at the Invermark car park in Glen Esk and heads through Glen Mark to the summit.  The path is quite good for most of the route but become rockier towards the summit. There are fabulous views of Glen Esk, Loch Lee and the Cairngorms. Look out for red deer as you make your way through the beautiful Glen Mark. Mount Keen stands at 939 m (3,081 feet). The walk will probably take about 5-7  hours.",
