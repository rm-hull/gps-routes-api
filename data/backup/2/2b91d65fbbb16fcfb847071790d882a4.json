There is also a 35 acre lake with picnic and BBQ areas, an Animal Farm with a Petting Barn, Miniature Golf and a Miniature Railway. The park is located a few miles south of Reading. You could extend your walk in the nearby Bramshill Forest and visit the RSPB's Hazeley Heath where wildlife such as red kites and deer can be seen.",

The long distance trail runs along the River Blackwater to Aldershot, visiting Farnborough, Frimley Hatches Nature Reserve and Tri Lakes Country Park on the way. A few miles to the east there's also California Country Park to explore. In nearby Hook there's some pleasant trails along the River Whitewater in the pretty Bassets Mead park."
