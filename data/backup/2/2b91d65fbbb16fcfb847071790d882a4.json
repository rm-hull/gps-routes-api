    "description": "This 350 acre park is very popular with walkers with four splendid nature trails to follow. One trail even allows you to get up close to the resident herds of Red and Fallow deer. There is also a 35 acre lake with picnic and BBQ areas, an Animal Farm with a Petting Barn, Miniature Golf and a Miniature Railway. The park is located a few miles south of Reading. You could extend your walk in the nearby Bramshill Forest and visit the RSPB's Hazeley Heath where wildlife such as red kites and deer can be seen.",
