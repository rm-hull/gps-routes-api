  "description": "This walk visits the pretty waterfalls in Flowerdale Glen on the eastern side of Loch Gairloch in Wester Ross. You can start the walk in the public car park in the village and then pick up a pleasant waymarked footpath heading west towards the falls. It's just over a mile to the Easan B\u00e0na waterfall which sits in a scenic and remote location. On the path you will pass the attractive Flowerdale House and enjoy some lovely views of the interesting flora in the glen. To continue your waterfall walking in the area head a few miles east to Loch Maree where you can visit the beautiful Victoria Falls.",
