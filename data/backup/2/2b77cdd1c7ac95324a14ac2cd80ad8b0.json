It opened in 1796 carrying coal from the coal fields to the City of Nottingham, the River Trent and beyond. With the advent of the railways canal traffic declined and the canal was closed in 1937. The southern section is now part of the River Trent Navigation. Since 1977, the Broxtowe Borough Council has owned and maintained the upstream sections from Wollaton to Langley Mill as a nature reserve and walking trail."

  "description": "This walk from the village of Cossall takes you to the Nottingham Canal Nature Reserve. There's a nice footpath here along the disused canal with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The trail runs for just over 1.5 miles to Awsworth and Cossall Common. Keep your eyes peeled for water loving birds such as moorhen and heron as you make your way along the path. Back in the village you can visit the noteworthy 13th century church and see the 17th century Willoughby Almshouses.",
