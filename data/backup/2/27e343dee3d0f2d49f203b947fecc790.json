  "description": "This beautiful circuit around Settle visits a series of rushing waterfalls, pretty becks, limestone outcrops and mysterious caves. The walk runs for about 9 miles with some moderate climbing on the opening section before descending back to the town on the second section. The walk starts from the train station in Settle and heads north east, passing the Castlebergh woodland and Barrel Sykes. Follow the footpaths past Langcliffe and then up to Winskill Stones where you will find a  74-acre area of limestone grassland and limestone pavement. From here it is a short walk to Catrigg Force. The picturesque falls have 2 main drops of about 20 feet and a series of smaller waterfalls. It's a delightful area, with peaceful woodland and the Stainforth Beck to see. After enjoying the falls you head south east past the Winskill Stones to the caves. You'll pass Jubilee Cave, Victoria Cave and Attermire Cave. The Victoria Cave contained fossil remains, including mammoth, straight-tusked elephant, cave bear and hippopotamus, Bos primigenius, Rhinoceros leptorhinus and spotted hyenas. The route then continues south, passing Sugar Loaf Hill before turning down High Hill Lane to reach Scaleber Force. The falls are in another lovely location with the water cascading down several levels to the deep pool below. The walk then heads north west, passing Springfield and Upper Settle before returning to the train station. To further explore the countryside surrounding the town you could try the Settle Loop long distance trail. At Catrigg Force you are close to the village of Stainforth where you can also visit the lovely Stainforth Force on the Settle Riverside Walk .",
