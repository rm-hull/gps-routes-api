  "description": "This Somerset based town sits in a nice position on the edge of the Quantocks. It's also close to some pleasant canalside and riverside walking trails. This circular walk from the town explores the local countryside and visits the nearby Bridgwater and Taunton Canal. It uses sections of the Macmillan Way, the Samaritans Way South West and the River Parret Trail to create the 10 mile loop around the town. The walk starts in the village and follows the Macmillan Way to Fordgate where you can meet with the canal. Follow the towpath north and it will take you towards Bridgwater where there are views of the River Parret. You then pick up the Samaritans Way South West and follow the trail through The Meads towards Rhode. The route heads south along a country lane to Woolsmersdon and Dancing Hill before returning to North Petherton.",

      "content": "You can extend the walk by visiting the pretty Durleigh Reservoir which lies just to the north of the town. The Somerset Space Walk runs along the towpath of the Bridgwater canal. The route is lined with a number of interesting sculptures representing the planets of the Solar System. You can see the scale model of the sun at Maunsel Lock and the description panels next to the sculptures to find out more. For more walking ideas in the area see the Quantocks Walks and Somerset Walks pages."
