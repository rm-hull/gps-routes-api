They do good food which can be taken in the nice conservatory or the terraced garden bar on warmer days. They also provide accommodation if you need to stay over. You can find the hotel near the train station on 130 Main St, with a postcode of CA27 0DE for your sat navs. The climb to the fine viewpoint at Warton Crag can also be started from here. In Allonby there's the 17th century Ship Inn. They serve good quality food and also provide rooms if you wish to stay in the area. Notably the authors Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins stayed there in 1857. Dickens described The Ship as \"a capital little homely inn looking out upon the sea...a clean nice place in a rough wild country\". You can find them on the Main Street at postcode CA15 6QF for your sat navs. The inn is dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."
