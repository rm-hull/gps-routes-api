  "description": "This attractive loch is part of the Galloway Forest Park in Dumfries and Galloway. To the east of the loch there's a shared cycling and walking route running through the adjacent forestry. You can follow this trail from the nearby Clatteringshaws Loch to reach the loch. It's a very beautiful and remote place with attractive forestry and hills surrounding the scenic lake. Look out for the black headed gulls on the island in the middle of the loch.",
