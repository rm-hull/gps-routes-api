The fort is also gives a good indicator of how the dunes have spread in the last 150 years as it originally had a clear view of fire out to sea when constructed. Now overgrown with vegetation and off limits to the public as it falls within the fenced off area of the West Beach Nature Reserve."

Originally the land was part of the Arun estuary but silted up during the early modern period with a sand spit deflecting the river east until the present day mouth was cut in the late 18th century. On the horizon are the sand dunes that separate the course from the beach. The clubhouse was rebuilt in 1985 to replace the original which was destroyed by fire."
