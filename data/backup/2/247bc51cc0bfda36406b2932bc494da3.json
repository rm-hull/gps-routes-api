  "description": "This wonderful walk takes you from Crosby to Southport along the beautiful Sefton coastline. The walk starts at Waterloo station in Crosby and heads to the coast via Crosby Marine Lake. You then head north to Hightown through the Dunes, passing the fascinating Another Place Sculptures on Crosby Beach. The Anthony Gormley piece was created in 1997, consisting of 100\u00a0cast iron\u00a0figures facing towards the sea. The figures are modelled on the artist's own naked body which has caused some controversy. As the tides ebb and flow, the figures are revealed and submerged by the sea. The next section takes you to Formby where you will enter the captivating Ainsdale National Nature Reserve and Formby Beach . This is a well known spot for spotting the Natterjack Toad in the fabulous scenery of dunes, pinewoods and golden sand. Also look out for Red Squirrels, sand lizards and great-crested newts on this fantastic section of the walk. The final section of the walk takes you past Royal Birkdale Golf course (home of the Open) and onto the lovely seaside town of Southport with its magnificent pier. The path comes to end shortly after at Crossens. Here you can visit RSPB Marshside, a wildlife rich wetland nature reserve located on the southern side of the\u00a0Ribble estuary. There's bird hides here and an informative visitor centre.",
