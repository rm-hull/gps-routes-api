  "description": "This varied walk in Dartmoor explores the attractive woodland, rivers and crags around Cadover Bridge and Dewerstone. The walk starts from the Cadover Bridge car park and takes you along a lovely section of the River Plym to North Wood with its mixed silver birch and oak. You continue through the woodland to Shaugh Bridge where you cross the Plym to begin the return leg on the northern side of the river. This section takes you through Dewerstone Wood and past the Dewerstone Rocks which are a popular spot for climbers. The route then passes Cadworthy Wood and Cadworthy Farm before returning to the car park. The walk can be extended by continuing along the Plym at Shaugh Bridge through the beautiful Bickleigh Vale. You could also try the Plymbridge Woods Cyle and Walking trail. This follows the trackbed of a disused railway line through oak woodland, with the River Plym by your side for part of the way. The Dewerstone woods are located close to the village of Shaugh Prior. You can visit the site by following a footpath north west from the village.",
