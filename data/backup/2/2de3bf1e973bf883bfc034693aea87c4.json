A mill of some kind has existed here since as early as 1542 but the present building dates from the early 19th century. One of the two mill wheels carries the date 1801. The term \u0093French Mill\u0094, often used about Carew, may be a reference to the use of French burr stones. It is hoped that the south wheel will at least be able to turn some of the auxiliary machinery on a regular basis in the future."

An agreed translation for the abbreviated Latin inscription was reached only in the 1940s."

  "description": "This fine castle in Pembrokeshire has a lovely one mile circular walking trail taking you around the pretty 23-acre Millpond. It's a good footpath which starts at the car park and takes you along the southern side of the castle to the interesting Tidal Mill. The present building dates from the early 19th century and is the only restored tidal Mill in Wales and one of just five in the UK. There are interactive displays which describe the operation of the mill machinery. You then cross the causeway over the Carew river on a little bridge before picking up the path along the mill pond on the north side of the castle. You can stop and rest in the picnic area before returning to the car park by crossing the Carew road bridge. You can also tour the castle and see the pretty Elizabethan walled garden with herb garden and several interesting buildings and architectural features. These include three gatehouses, the 12th century Old Tower and the Great Hall which saw the gathering of most of the Welsh nobility for the Great Tournament of 1507. If you would like to continue your walking in this area then you could head to the nearby Lawrenny Quay and enjoy riverside walking along the Cresswell River and the Daugleddau River. The epic Landsker Borderlands Trail also passes through the area.",
