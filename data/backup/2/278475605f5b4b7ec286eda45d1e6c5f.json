In 1880 the brick roundhouse of the disused mill was converted into a Chapel of Ease to St Mary's Parish Church, Reigate and is now probably the only mill in the world to have been consecrated as a place of worship. The chapel, named St Cross Chapel, was opened for services on 14 September 1880 and has continued to this day when services are held throughout the summer."

  "description": "The Skimmington Castle pub is a great place to visit and start a walk from. This circular walk from the inn takes you to two of the highlights of the area at Reigate Heath and Colley Hill. The walk starts from the good sized car park at the pub which is located between Reigate Hill and Reigate Park on Bonnys Road. From here you pick up footpaths heading north through the heath where there's a windmill, pretty heather and acid grassland. You then follow Clifton Lane north before picking up a section of the North Downs Way to climb Colley Hill. Standing at a height of 722 ft (220 m) the hill commands fine views over the surrounding countryside of the North Downs. The route then descends east with the option of continuing to the nearby Reigate Hill. This route turns south, picking up a section of the Greensand Way and following the waymarked path back to Skimmington. Back at the pub you can enjoy refreshments in the nice outdoor seating area if the weather is fine. There's nice views over to the heath and the golf course plus a very good menu to choose from. The pub is also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you.",
