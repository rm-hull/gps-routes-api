      "caption": "Wolterton Hall - the former stable block Wolterton Hall was built by the architect Thomas Ripley in the 1720s for Horatio Walpole, younger brother of Britain's first Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole. On the death of the 3rd Earl in 1858 the Hall was abandoned until 1905, when the Earl moved back in. Ever since the present Earl inherited the property in 1989, there has been a programme of reorganisation, conservation and research into the rich family history of the Walpoles and the Hall now houses an extensive collection of family portraits. The ruined tower, all that remains of St Margarets church, stands at the edge of Wolterton Park"

A ha-ha is a dry ditch or trench with a fence, wall or hedge running along its bottom or side, forming the boundary to a garden or park. It is designed so as not to interrupt the view, and to be invisible until closely approached. The originator of the ha-ha is believed to be the English garden designer Charles Bridgeman (1690-1738). The waymarked public footpaths and permissive paths traversing Wolterton Park cover more than 20 miles; they lead around Wolterton and neighbouring Mannington, some connecting with the Weavers Way long distance footpath and the Holt circular walk. There also is an orienteering course and adventure playground."

  "description": "This walk explores the grounds of the 18th century Wolterton Park estate in Norfolk. This historic hall dates back to the mid 1700s when it was designed by the architect Thomas Ripley, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lord Walpole and his brother Sir Robert Walpole who is generally considered the first de facto first Prime Minister of Great Britain. The hall is generally not open to the public unless you are staying at the hotel or you book one of the tours. This walk circles the hall on public footpaths and country lanes that run around the perimiter of the site. There's some lovely countryside and views across the expansive estate from the paths. The walk starts from the Saracen's Head pub, located just north east of the park. From here you follow birdle paths south to Fring Wood Farm where you turn west towards the village of Itteringham. Country lanes will then take you north east to return to the pub. On the western fringes of the walk you will come very close to Mannington Hall .",
