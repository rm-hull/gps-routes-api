  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll along this pretty reservoir in Bartley Green, Birmingham. It's a lovely spot with sailboats on the water, views to the city and lots of birdlife to look out for. The reservoir is known as the place where Bill Oddie did much of his early birdwatching. To extend your walk you could visit Senneleys Park or head south to Frankley Reservoir. Both of these sites are very close by. Heading south west will take you up to Frankley Beeches where there's a nice viewpoint and some woodland trails.",
