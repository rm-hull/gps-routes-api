  "description": "This walk visits Downley Common next to the Buckinghamshire village of Downley in the Chilterns near High Wycombe. There's a series of nice footpaths taking you around the woodland and grassland of the common. It's a good place for an easy stroll with lots of woodland birds to look out for on the way. You can easily extend the walk by visiting the National Trust's Hughenden Park which lies just to the east. Heading north will take you to Naphill Common.",
