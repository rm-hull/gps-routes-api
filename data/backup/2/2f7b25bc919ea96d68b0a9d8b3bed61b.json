  "description": "Climb to the 7th highest mountain in Snowdonia on this challenging walk in the Carneddau mountain range. Start the walk from the National Trust Ogwen Cottage car park at the western end of Llyn Ogwen. Head up to the A5 and turn left until you cross the bridge. On your right you should see a stile and a National Trust information board. This path will lead you all the way up to the Pen Yr Ole Wen summit. The mountain stands at a height of 978 m (3,209 ft), the same height as England's highest peak, Scafell Pike. There's splendid views over the Ogwen Valley, Cwm Idwal and the Glyderau group including Tryfan. After taking in the views the route then descends back to the car park on the same track. To extend your walk you can try our Carneddau Walk and explore the other mountains in the range. You can also enjoy lovely lakeside walks around the nearby Cwm Idwal and Llyn Ogwen .",

It's open seven days per week for most of the year \u2013 opening only at weekends during the winter months. The popular snack bar can trace its history back to the early 1900\u2019s when it was precariously perched on rocks at the head of the waterfall from which it takes its name. Known throughout the world it has its place in the mountaineering history in this part of Snowdonia and has been run by the same family since 1953. It moved to its current location over forty years ago to the newer premises incorporating Snowdonia National Park warden office and public toilets. It sells a range of drinks, snacks, pasties, paninis and locally baked cakes. There's an outdoor seating area where you can enjoy your food with fine views of the surrounding mountains. You can find the snack bar between Llyn Ogwen and Llyn Idwal at postcode of LL57 3LZ for your sat navs."

The off road trail will take you north to the coast at Bangor, passing the splendid Penrhyn Quarry at Bethesda and the stunning glacial valley of Nant Ffrancon on the way. It runs mostly along old railway paths and the River Ogwen before finishing on the coast. The route is also suitable for walkers."
