  "description": "This delightful village is located near York and Easingwold in the Hambleton District of North Yorkshire. The settlement is notable for the 18th-century Georgian English country house of Sutton Park which includes some beautiful landscaped gardens. It's a private house but the gardens are open to the public on certain days of the year. This circular walk follows footpaths past the estate and through the farmland to the south of the village. You'll also pass the Manor House and pond on the eastern side of the settlement. The village is located just a few miles south of the Howardian Hills AONB where there are numerous options for extending your walking in the area.",

The historic settlement includes a photogenic ruined castle, a Grade I listed 12th century church and a fine country pub to relax in after your exercise. The Foss Walk, Ebor Way and the Centenary Way long distance trails can also be picked up in this area. The historic Beningbrough Hall lies a few miles south west.
