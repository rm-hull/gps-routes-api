  "description": "These pretty woods near the village of High Littleton have some nice woodland trails to try. There's free car parking and in the spring there's lots of bluebells within the ancient, mixed woodland. There's also a lovely waterfall and the option of picking up the Limestone Link which skirts the southern edge of the woods. You could pick up this long distance trail and head towards Clutton, Temple Cloud or Timsbury. In nearby Clutton you can join with the Three Peaks Walk and further explore the beautiful Chew Valley. Heading west will take you to the splendid Chew Valley Lake. Greyfield Woods are located not far from both Bristol and Bath.",

Heading west along the trail will take you to the popular Chew Valley Lake with the pretty Litton Reservoir also in this area. Just to the south there's the attractive town of Midsomer Norton where there's nice trails along the River Somer in the town centre. You can reach the woods from the nearby village of Paulton by following the Limestone Link. The village has a couple of nice pubs to relax in. The circular Timsbury Walk also visits the woods from the nearby village. For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks page."
