  "description": "This Hampshire based village has some lovely trails through the attractive countryside of the Meon Valley. There's also some fine listed buildings including the 13th century church and 18th century Meonstoke House which includes some excellent Georgian architecture. This route from the village uses sections of The South Downs Way and the Monarch's Way to create a circular walk around the village. On the way you'll enjoy a climb to the splendid viewpoints on Old Winchester Hill to the east and Beacon Hill to the west of the settlement. The site is one of the highlights of the area with the hill and surrounding area a designated National Nature Reserve which includes a wide variety of butterflies and wildlife to see. These include buzzards, kites, roe deer and foxes. On Beacon Hill there's a round barrow cemetery dating to the Late Neolithic or Bronze Age, which is designated as a scheduled monument. There's also fine views towards the Solent on the coast. The route also visits the neighbouring villages of Wanford and West Meon which lies just to the north.",
