  "description": "This popular circular walk takes you around the beautiful Coumshingaun Lake in the Comeragh Mountains of County Waterford. The hike runs for just under 7km and includes some challenging steep climbs with fabulous views of the surrounding mountains from the high points. There is some scrambling involved so good hiking boots are a must. The walk should take between 3-4 hours to complete. You can start and finish the walk at Kilclooney Wood which lies just to the east of the lake. At the south western end you also have the option of climbing to Fauscoum which stands at a height of 845 metres. This turns the route into a more challenging hike. To continue your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Mahon Falls where there's a good track running through the River Mahon valley to a series of pretty cascades.",

Just to the north west there's the Lough Mohra and Rath Beag Loop. The lake is a glacial coum and located in a lovely remote spot with beautiful countryside, forestry and mountains surrounding it.  Further to the north west there's the Galty Mountains where you can enjoy a walk to the secluded Lough Curra, climb to the excellent viewpoint at Galtymore Mountain and try the Lake Muskry Trail. To the west is the beautiful Bay Lough. The remote Corrie Lake is located at the The Vee in the Knockmealdown Mountain range, a popular local area for hiking."
