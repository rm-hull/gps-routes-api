  "description": "Climb to the summit of this hill in the Cheviots and enjoy fabulous views into Scotland and England as you stand high on the border. This challenging circular route runs for a distance of about 10 miles using the bridleways and footpaths that cross the area. The walk begins from the Wedder Leap car park and heads towards Shorthope hill, crossing the River Coquet and following the Rowhope Burn as you go. You continue the climb to Little Ward Law before coming to Russel's Cairn at the 619 m (2,031 ft) summit of Windy Gyle. From here there are wonderful views over the Scottish Borders, the Eildon Hills and Edinburgh. You begin the descent by heading west along the Pennine Way and then south towards Swineside Law and Hindside Knowe. Shortly after you cross the River Coquet and return to the car park. This is a challenging walk but the footpaths are generally good and you're rewarded with some stunning scenery. To continue your walking in the Cheviots you could climb the highest hill - The Cheviot .",
