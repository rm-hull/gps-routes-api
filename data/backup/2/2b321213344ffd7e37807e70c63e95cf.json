Here you can explore a series of early Neolithic chambered long barrows and megalithic monuments located in the lower valley of the River Medway. You can also climb to a splendid North Downs viewpoint at Blue Bell Hill near here. Two long distance trails pass near to the ancient site in the shape of the North Downs Way and the Pilgrims Way. Both of these waymarked paths provide and opportunity for further exploring the surrounding countryside. For more walking ideas in the area see the Kent Walks and North Downs Walks pages."
