  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Moray Coast Trail from Findhorn to Burghead. The route runs for just under 12 miles along a flat easy footpath. You'll pass along the beautiful Burghead Bay with fine coastal views throughout. The area includes expansive forest on one side and some of the best wide beaches in the country on the other. You can start the walk from the public car park next to the beach and dunes in Findhorn. Then pick up the waymarked trail and follow it east along the bay, passing RAF Kinloss, Bennet Hill and the Roseisle Forest before finishing in Burghead. At the eastern end you can extend the walk on the next leg from Burghead to Hopeman. In Findhorn there's the walking and cycling trails in the expansive Culbin Forest to explore.",
