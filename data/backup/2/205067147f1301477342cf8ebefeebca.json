The low, false-fronted, building towards the right of the photograph, with the two white wings, used to be a small cinema but this was destroyed in the 1950s. Since the photograph was taken the site has been demolished and the Crowthorne Library and apartments now stand there. To the left,just beyond the Monica's, and many years ago, was Bucklers sports car factory."

  "description": "This large Berkshire based village is located in a nice spot on the edge of Bracknell Forest. There's miles of local woodland trails and a couple of attractive country parks to visit in the area. This circular walk from the village visits two of the highlights of the area at Tri Lakes Country Park and Finchampstead Ridges. The walk starts from the public car park to the south of the village. From here you can head south west through the edge of Bracknell Forest and the Edgbarrow Woods Nature Reserve towards Little Sandhurst. Here you can pick up the Three Castles Path and follow the waymarked footpath through the Tri Lakes Park where there are a series of scenic lakes to admire. You could also take a small detour near here to visit Sandhurst where you can explore the memorial park and the Shepherd meadows on the River Blackwater Valley Footpath. The route then heads north to take you to the National Trust's Finchampstead Ridges. There's a series of quiet woodland trails, fine views from the high points and a number of tranquil ponds to enjoy here. After exploring the ridges the route then heads east on public footpaths to return you to Crowthorne.",
