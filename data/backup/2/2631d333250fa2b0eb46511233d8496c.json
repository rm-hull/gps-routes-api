Calf Hey is one of three reservoirs in the beautiful moorland valley of Haslingden Grane. This once thriving valley was depopulated with the construction of Ogden reservoir, which was opened in 1912. Prior to that, the valley was home to more than 1,300 people, who supported seven pubs, a church and a chapel. Reminders of this lost village can be found in the tumbled ruins half hidden in the moorland grass."

  "description": "The attractive area of Haslingden Grane includes some nice walking trails around Calf Hey Reservoir and through the adjacent woodland. There's a car park off Calf Hey Road at the north eastern end of reservoir. From here you can pick up public footpaths around the water and through the surrounding woodland. The Rossendale Way long distance trail runs through the area so you could pick this up to extend your walk. You can pick it up and head east towards Ogden and Holden Wood Reservoir. You could also climb south from the reservoir to Musbery Heights where there are splendid views back down to the water. Due south of the reservoirs there are nice trails across Holcombe Moor leading to the Peel Tower. The monument is dedicated to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th century Prime Minister considered the father of modern British policing. It's a major local landmark and worth the climb to the top for the views over the area. The worthy riverside settlements of Ramsbottom and Summerseat can also be explored around here.",

You can find it at 280 Holcombe Road, Helmshore with a postcode of BB4 4NP for your sat navs. You could also head into Haslingden where there are many good cafes and pubs to choose from."

Also known as Tor Hill this fine viewpoint commands fine views over the Alden Valley to its south and Musbury Valley to the north. Our circular walk climbs to the summit from the nearby village of Helmshore. To the north east of Haslingden there's the impressive Haslingden Halo. There's a striking art structure and another fine viewpoint to be found here. Just south of Ramsbottom there's the worthy Redisher Wood to explore. In the woods there are peaceful woodland trails and water features including the Holcombe Brook, a picturesque lake and photogenic waterfalls. At the reservoir you can pick up the Oswaldtwistle Walk which starts from the nearby town. It explores the photogenic Oswaldtwistle Moor Wind Farm and the beautiful Valley of Haslingden Grane. For more walking ideas in the county see the Lancashire Walks page."
