Calf Hey is one of three reservoirs in the beautiful moorland valley of Haslingden Grane. This once thriving valley was depopulated with the construction of Ogden reservoir, which was opened in 1912. Prior to that, the valley was home to more than 1,300 people, who supported seven pubs, a church and a chapel. Reminders of this lost village can be found in the tumbled ruins half hidden in the moorland grass."

  "description": "The attractive area of Haslingden Grane includes some nice walking trails around Calf Hey Reservoir and through the adjacent woodland. There's a car park off Calf Hey Road at the north eastern end of reservoir. From here you can pick up public footpaths around the water and through the surrounding woodland. The Rossendale Way long distance trail runs through the area so you could pick this up to extend your walk. You can pick it up and head east towards Ogden and Holden Wood Reservoir. You could also climb south from the reservoir to Musbery Heights where there are splendid views back down to the water. Due south of the reservoirs there are nice trails across Holcombe Moor leading to the Peel Tower. The monument is dedicated to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th century Prime Minister considered the father of modern British policing. It's a major local landmark and worth the climb to the top for the views over the area. The worthy riverside settlements of Ramsbottom and Summerseat can also be explored around here.",
