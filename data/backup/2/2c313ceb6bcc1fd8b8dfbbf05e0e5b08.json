  "description": "Follow the Little Ouse River on this delightful, gentle walk through Thetford Forest. The route runs for about 10 miles along a fairly flat riverside path surrounded by peaceful woodland. The walk starts in Thetford mainly following the river towpath through Santon Downham to Brandon. At Brandon you'll find the super Brandon Country Park. Here you will find beautiful lakeside lawns, a delightful walled garden and an excellent visitor centre. A few miles to the north of the park you'll find the splendid Lynford Arboretum. It's a lovely place for a walk with woodland trails, pretty lakes and an impressive 19th century Sequoia Avenue to see.",
