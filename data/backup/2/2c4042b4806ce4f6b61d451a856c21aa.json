    "description": "A circular walk from the Norwich village of Hellesdon. The route uses a section of the Marriot's Way and other public paths to explore the area to the north west of Hellesdon. On the way there's some attractive countryside and views of the River Wensum to enjoy. The village is located about 4 miles north-west of Norwich city centre. Start the walk from Hellesdon Bridge over the Wensum. From here you can pick up the Marriot's Way and follow the signed footpath north west towards Drayton and Taverham where you could take a detour to visit Taverham Mill . The mill is actually a wildlife rich nature reserve with three colour coded walking trails taking you to grassland, woodland, water meadow and a wild flower meadow. The route then leaves the path and follows Costessey Lane around the outskirts of Costessey . You can then follow other public footpaths south east to return to the bridge.",
