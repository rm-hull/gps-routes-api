  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this popular Cumbrian town. Kirkby Lonsdale sits on the western edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, within the beautiful Lune Valley. It's a delightful place and home to 'Ruskin's View'. He described the view of the River Lune from the churchyard as 'One of the loveliest views in England'. It was painted by J.M.W Turner in the early 19th century. The town is a great base for walkers looking to explore the Cumbrian section of the Yorkshire Dales. This walk starts in the town centre and head's to Devil's Bridge over the Lune. The wonderful 14th century bridge is a grade I listed structure and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.  It's a very picturesque spot with the ancient bridge giving lovely views of the river below. At the old bridge you pick up the Lune Valley Ramble long distance waymarked path to take you south along the river towards Nether Burrow. Here you turn north west to the Lancashire village of Whittington. The pretty village has an old church and quaint cottages. The final section of the walk takes you past Whittington Hall and Sellet Hall before returning to the town. There's lots of other nice walks to try in this attractive area. One of the real highlights are the wonderful Ingleton Falls. Located just 5 miles to the east of the town, the falls are one of the most popular walks in England. Just to the west of the town you can pick up the Limestone Link and climb to the wonderful limestone pavement at Hutton Roof Crags and Farleton Fell. The area has fascinating rock formations and wonderful views over the Lune Valley to the Yorkshire Dales hills and mountains. Also nearby is the beautiful Barbondale where you can enjoy another waterside walk along the pretty Barbon Beck. If you continue south along the River Lune you will come to Arkholme and Gressingham where the Lune meets the River Wenning.",
