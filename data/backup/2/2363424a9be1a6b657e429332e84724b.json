  "description": "This South Oxfordshire based village is located on the River Thames near Streatley and Wallingford. The pictureque stretch of the Thames around Moulsford has strong literary connections, featuring in The Wind in the Willows and Jerome K Jerome's Three Men in a Boat. This circular walk from the village takes you along both sides of the Thames visiting the neighbouring settlements of North Stoke, South Stoke, Streatley and Goring. The route makes use of The Ridgeway and Thames Path National Trails. Just north of Moulsford you'll also pass through Cholsey Marsh where you can look out for a wide variety of wildlife including crested grebe, warblers and a colony of the nationally rare Desmoulin's whorl snail. It's a particularly lovely section of the River Thames with weirs, old bridges and wonderful views of the surrounding Chilterns countryside.",
