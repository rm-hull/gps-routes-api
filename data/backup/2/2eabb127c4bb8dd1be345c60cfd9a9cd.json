  "description": "This walk visits Cateran Hole, a cave located in a crater on Cateran Hill in Northumberland. At the intriguing site you can walk down some steps into the narrow passage of the cave and then crawl into a small chamber if you feel brave enough. The walk starts from the car park at Hepburn Woods which lies about 3 miles to the west of the hole. From here you can follow paths east to Hepburn Crags and then on to the old Quarry on Quarryhouse Moor. Around here you will find a footpath heading south and then east across the moor to Cateran Hole. It's a rather unique location with the unusual hole in a remote location on the moors. There are grassy verges near to the path down to the cave where you could park a bit closer if you prefer. On the walk you will pass Ros Castle where there's a splendid viewpoint and an Iron Age Hillfort.",
