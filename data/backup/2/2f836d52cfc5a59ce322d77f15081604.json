  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this beautiful natural amphitheatre in the North York Moors. The hollow is 400\u00a0ft deep and was created over thousands of years by a series of landslides caused by water pressure. The walk starts from the parking area by Horcum Wood and takes you across Levisham Moor to Dundale Griff and Horcum Slack before returning to the car park. You'll pass interesting Bronze Age barrows, rocky ravines, woodland, waterfalls and streams on your way through this lovely area.\u00a0You can also see wild flowers and purple heather on the moor in the spring and summer. It's also a splendid area for wildlife - look out for deer,\u00a0grouse,  curlew, lapwing, merlin and golden plover. There is the possibility of a short diversion to Skelton Tower. A footpath leading west from Dundale Griff leads to this splendid beauty spot which commands great views over Newtondale. The Hole of Horcum is located near to the villages of Saltergate and Levisham. The walk could also be easily started from either of these locations. Our Levisham Circular Walk begins from Levisham Station on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. You can catch the train from nearby Pickering as an alternative to coming by car. The area is located just north of the splendid Dalby Forest where you can enjoy miles of waymarked walking and cycling trails. Also nearby is the splendid Bridestones Nature Reserve with its ancient sandstone rocks, woodland and meadows.  The long distance Tabular Hills Walk runs right past the site. The waymarked trail can be followed to Dalby Forest, Cropton Forest and the Bridestones.",
