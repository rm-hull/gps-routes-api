  "description": "This attractive market town in North Yorkshire has nice footpaths to follow through Malton Castle Gardens and along the River Derwent. There's also the Roman fort at Orchard Fields, historic buildings and a lovely market place. Start your walk in the town centre and head east past the Lodge to the Malton Castle Gardens and the Roman Fort. The lovely 5 acre gardens have a number of interesting flowers, plants and trees to see. They are located on the site of a historic castle. All that remains of the castle is a street name and a few remnants of wall. The Roman fort of Derventio Brigantum is of some note. It dates from 71AD and included large, elaborate dwellings with heated floors, baking ovens, workshops and storehouses, and even a bath house. Excavations have revealed pottery, jet jewellery and coinage. A plaque recording the excavations by Philip Corder in the late 1920s can be found on the site. After exploring the site you can cross the river and pick up a footpath along the Derwent. The Centenary Way long distance trail runs through the town so there is scope for extending your walking in the area. You could follow the trail south along the River Derwent to the atmospheric ruins of Kirkham Abbey. Following it east will take you over the river to Norton-on-Derwent and then through the countryside to Settrington. The town sits on the edge of the Howardian Hills AONB where there's numerous fine walking trails to try. For example if you head a few miles to the west you can visit the splendid Castle Howard near Welburn. Here you'll find 1000 acres of parkland and gardens surrounding a fine stately home. You could also visit the nearby village of Terrington which is another great base for exploring the beautiful countryside of the Howardian Hills.",

It's an idyllic and appealing place with a historic Saxon Church, a picturesque cricket pitch by the 18th century Hovingham Hall, a pretty beck and two fine hotels to relax in after your exercise.
