  "description": "An easy walk from Whitstable to the nearby village of Seasalter on the Kent coast. It's about 1.6 mile stroll along a section of the Saxon Shore Way long distance trail. Along the way there's nice views of the beaches, pretty seafront cottages and lots of little beach huts. There's also fine views across the estuary of the River Swale to the Isle of Sheppey. The village of Seasalter has a nice pebble beach and the Michelin starred Sportsman pub. The well known pub is located at the western end of the village on a site which has hosted an inn since 1642. It's a great place for refreshments before returning to Whitstable. To extend the walk continue west to Faversham where you can visit the wildlife rich South Bank of Swale Nature Reserve and Faversham Creek. See the Faversham Creek to Seasalter Walk for photos and more details.",
