  "description": "Explore this large area of heathland and pine woodland on this walk near Elstead in Surrey. There's lots of paths to follow with some moderate climbs and great views over the surrounding countryside. The land is owned by the MOD so there may be training exercises at certain times but the area is also open to the public. The common is located very close to the excellent Frensham Country Park where you will find more trails taking you around the beautiful Frensham Ponds and the surrounding woodland and heathland. Just to the east is Thursley National Nature Reserve and Thursley Common. The Sculpture Park Churt and the Devil's Jumps. These three small hills are located on the southern edge of the common. Follow the paths over Kettlebury Hill to reach them.",
