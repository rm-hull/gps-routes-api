It dates from around 1740 and since 1899 fed Neath's Mosshouse reservoir. In the 18th. century there was a means of damming the water at the top so that it could be released in an impressive surge for the amusement of guests of the Mackworth family who then owned the Gnoll Estate. After rain it's well worth a visit."

  "description": "Explore 240 acres of woodland and wide open spaces in this country park in Neath. There are miles of walking trails taking you to Mosshouse Wood Reservoir, Mosshouse Woods, two large duck ponds, two impressive 18th century cascades and the Gnoll House ruins. Gnoll Park was voted as the Best Picnic spot in Wales in the 2010 Warburtons National Picnic Awards. The park is located just a short walk from Neath town centre. There is a lovely waterside walking path running along the nearby Neath River and Neath Canal so this is a good option if you would like to continue your walk. You could also visit the delightful Aberdulais Falls located just north of the park. The Tennant Canal also runs through the area and can be followed west towards Swansea.",
