  "description": "This Hampshire based village is located just north of the town of Liss in the South Downs . Local walking highlights include Ludshott Common , Bramshott Common and the expansive Woolmer Forest which lies just to the east of the settlement. This circular walk explores the countryside to the west of the village. On the way there are views of the River Rother and a visit to the historic Old Church which dates back to the 13th century. Only the chancel remains of the old church but the present church of St. John the Baptist, was built in 1875, and lies just opposite the Old Church.",
