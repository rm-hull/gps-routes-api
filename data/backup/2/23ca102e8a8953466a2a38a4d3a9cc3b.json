  "description": "This splendid park in Glasgow was named the best park in Britain in 2006 and in 2008, was named the best park in Europe. Highlights in the park include a riverside section along the pretty White Cart River, a beautiful walled garden with glasshouses, a delightful woodland garden and the very grand Pollok House - Scotland\u2019s answer to Downton Abbey. The park is a lovely place for a peaceful stroll but National Cycle Network route 75 also runs right through the grounds so you can bring your bike too. Head west from the park and you can visit the excellent Gleniffer Braes Country Park in Paisley. There's wonderful viewpoints and miles of good cycling and walking trails to be found here. It's a great place to extend your outing if you have time.",
