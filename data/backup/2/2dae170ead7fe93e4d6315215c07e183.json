  "description": "These lovely woods in Doncaster have lots of nice walks to try. The park consists of broadleaf woodland, expansive meadows and wetland areas. There's a really nice mixture of habitats with great views of the surrounding countryside from the park's high points. Also look out for a number of tranquil ponds and a series of interesting sculptures dotted around the site. The park is located in Adwick Le Street with a car park just off Long Lands Lane. National Cycle Route 62 runs just to the east of the woods, near Scawthorpe. To extend your walking in the area you could visit the nearby Brodsworth Hall. The Victorian country house has some beautiful gardens to explore.",
