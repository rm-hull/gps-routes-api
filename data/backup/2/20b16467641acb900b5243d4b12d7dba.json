The route then continues east toward Gunnerside Moor. Just south of here you will pass another major highlight of the area at Gunnerside Gill. It's a beautiful valley with imposing scars, woodland, waterfalls and the pretty Gunnerside Beck running through the centre. The final stage of the walk takes you south along the pretty Gunnerside Beck which leads you back to the village. To continue your walking in the area try the Gunnerside Gill Circular Walk which also starts in the village.
