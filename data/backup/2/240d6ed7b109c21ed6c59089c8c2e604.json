  "description": "This pretty lake in Epping Forest has a nice circular walking trail around its perimeter. It's a nice easy stroll with the option of extending your walk into the surrounding woodland. The path is surfaced and fully accessible having recently been landscaped as part of the Heritage Lottery Funded Branching Out Project. A splendid boardwalk has also been created so you can enjoy a stroll above the water. As you walk around the site look out for wildlife including coots, swans, geese and great crested grebes on the lake. The area has good facilities with a car park just off Rangers Road. You can see this on the google street view link below. If you feel like stretching your legs further, you can pick up the Epping Forest Centenary Walk which runs past the lake. Follow it north to further explore the forest on waymarked footpaths. Head south and you can visit the Highams Park and Knighton Wood .",
