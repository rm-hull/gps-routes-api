  "description": "This medieval castle is surrounded by a beautiful 55 acre country park with woodland, grassland and several walking paths. Scenic highlights include the River Nedern that winds its way through the park. There is also the picturesque wildlife pond which is home to a variety of wildfowl. The castle is located just a few miles south of Chepstow where you can visit another historic castle. Head west along the coast and you could visit Redwick where there's some lovely views over the Severn Estuary on the circular walk.",
