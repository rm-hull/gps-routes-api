  "description": "The delightful Oxfordshire town of Dorchester on Thames has some lovely footpaths to follow through the surrounding countryside and woodland. This circular walk visits the River Thames, Little Wittenham Wood and Castle Hill Iron Age Hillfort. There's much to enjoy in the area, with riverside paths, peaceful woodland trails and wonderful views from the Wittenham Clumps hills on the southern side of the Thames. A must see in the town is the magnificent Dorchester Abbey. The abbey dates from 1140 and contains a fascinating museum detailing the history of the area. The walk starts in the town centre and heads south through the town before turning west towards Little Wittenham. Here you cross the Thames and follow paths through Little Wittenham Woods to Wittenham Clumps. These two hills are a popular local attraction, offering wonderful views of the Oxfordshire countryside from the high points. After exploring the site of an Iron Age Hillfort on Castle Hill, the walk descends through farmland to Shillingford where you cross the Thames on the 19th century bridge. Here you pick up the Thames Path to take you back along the river before turning north to return to the town. To extend your walking in the area, simply head south along the riverside path to Wallingford where you can visit the ruins of the 11th century Wallingford Castle and pick up The Ridgeway National Trail.",

Just to the west you can visit the neighbouring villages of Sutton Courtenay, Clifton Hampden and Culham. The former picturesque settlement has several historic buildings including the 12th century Norman Hall and The Abbey - a Grade I listed medieval courtyard house. Culham has a particularly lovely lock and weir to admire. Head south along the river and you will soon come to the village of Benson. There's a Norman church, a fine 18th century coaching inn and the picturesque Benson Lock to see in this worthy settlement. For more walking ideas in the area see the Oxfordshire Walks page."
