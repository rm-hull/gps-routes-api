  "description": "This nice easy circular walk starts and finishes in Ferndown, first taking you through Ferndown Forest to Longham where you will pass the pretty Longham Lakes. You then join the River Stour for a pleasant waterside stretch taking you to Dudsbury before heading around Holmwood Park and finishing in Ferndown. Just to the north of Ferndown the route skirts the Holt Heath National Nature Reserve where there's a series of good walking trails and lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. You'll also pass through Ferndown Common where there's pretty heather and a Bronze age barrow to see. The popular Castleman Trailway links with the route in Ferndown Forest. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along a dismantled railway line from Ringwood to Poole.",
