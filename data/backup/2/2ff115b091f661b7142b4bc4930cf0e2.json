  "description": "This is a short walk through Camer Country Park and into the surrounding countryside and woodland. The park is located close to Meopham train station and parking is also available at the western end of the park. In the park you will find 40 acres of ancient parkland, grassland and woods. There's also good facilities such as a cafe and refreshment kiosk. This walk starts at the car park and takes you through the park to the adjacent Henley Wood and then through some lovely countryside to the pretty village of Luddesdown. The walk makes use of the Wealdway long distance footpath, so you could continue along this trail to extend your walk. Also just to the north is Shorne Woods Country Park where you'll find 288 acres of rolling woodlands, wetlands and meadows. The park is located close to Rochester and Chatham.",
