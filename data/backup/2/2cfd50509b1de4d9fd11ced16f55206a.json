  "description": "The scenery surrounding this large reservoir near Llanidloes is truly wonderful. This walk takes you along the western side of the reservoir along the Glyndwr's Way long distance footpath. You start at the car park at south western end of the water with views of the Afon Clywedog. You then head past the spectacular dam which is the tallest concrete dam in the UK, with a height of 72 metres and a length of 230 metres. The walk continues to the north western edge of the reservoir with a mixture of lakeside sections and woodland trails. It's a splendid area for bird watching too. Look out for ospreys, red kites, buzzards and ravens on your walk. The whole of this route is designed for walkers but cyclists can enjoy the second half of the route where there is a splendid trail along the lakeside. For the first half you can follow country lanes to the west of the lake. If you would like to continue your walking in the area you could continue along the Glyndwr's Way or the Sabrina Way into the adjacent Hafren Forest .",

It is located close to the center of Llanidloes on the High Street with a postcode of SY18 6BY for your sat navs."
