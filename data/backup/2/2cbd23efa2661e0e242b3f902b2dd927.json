  "description": "Visit the Norfolk Broads village of Hickling and enjoy a walk around the beautiful Hickling Broad. It's the largest of the Broads and a fantastic area for wildlife. Look out for common crane, bittern, marsh harrier bearded tit and Cetti's warbler as you make your way around the lake. Also of interest are Chinese water deer, red deer and otters. The walk starts at the car park and visitor centre off Stubbs Road on the north eastern side of the broad. From here you can pick up footpaths heading west to Hickling Heath. The walk then uses a section of the Weavers' Way long distance trail to take you around the broad to the River Thurne. Here you can enjoy riverside footpaths to Potter Heigham Bridge and boatyard where refreshments are available at the waterside Potters tearooms. The route then returns to the car park on the same paths. It's easy to extend your walk by heading about a mile to the east and visiting the National Trust run Horsey Windpump and Horsey Mere. Here you'll find waymarked circular walks taking you to the interesting old drainage windmill and around the pretty mere. Just to the south you can visit Fleggburgh and Filby Broad where there's a nice little circular walk from the village to the broad and Burgh Common. If you follow the Weaver's Way and the River Bure south you will come to the market town of Acle which is well worth a visit.",
