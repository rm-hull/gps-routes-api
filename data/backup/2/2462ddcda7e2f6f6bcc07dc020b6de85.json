Harehills is the second most densely populated area in Europe. Gledhow lane runs through the woods, a superb photogenic city Oasis. The lane is a steep winding road known locally as Little Switzerland."

  "description": "Enjoy a pleasant stroll through these woods in Leeds. There is a nice footpath running along Gledhow Beck and around Gledhow Lake for about a mile. The area is quite small at 57 acres but very peaceful and pretty. There's a wide variety of flora and fauna with birds such as Chaffinch, Chiff Chaff, Dipper and Dunnock to look out for. Plants and flowers include Bluebell, Common Knapweed and Cornflower. It also includes a 19th century open air bath house in the south eastern corner. You can extend your walk by heading to the nearby Roundhay Park. It's located just over a mile from the woods and includes 700 acres of parkland, lakes and gardens in one of the largest parks Britain. Gipton Wood is also located just a 10 minute walk away.",
