  "description": "This area of woodland in south west Sheffield has some good mountain bike trails and footpaths for walkers. The Blue graded Blue Steel trail twists and turns through berms and rollers from top to bottom. The woods are also criss crossed with miles of footpaths which are popular with dog walkers. The site is located at Ringinglow, just to the west of Ecclesall Woods which is a good place to extend your exercise. The Sheffield Round Walk also skirts the edge of the woods and is another good way to explore the countryside, villages and woods surrounding the city. See the video below for details of the mtb trails. The Blue Steel trail is marked out on the open street map below.",
