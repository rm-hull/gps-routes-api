  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Ceredigion Coast Path from the village of Aberporth to Tresaith and Traeth Penbryn. It's a beautiful area with sandy beaches, waterfalls and marvellous sea views on the way. The route runs for about 2.5 miles so 5 miles there and back. On the way there's some moderate climbs up to the cliffs near Penbryn. The walk starts at Aberporth Bay where there's a blue flag beach. Here you can pick up the coast path and follow it east to Tresaith. There's another nice beach here with a waterfall over the cliffs from the Afon Saith. The area is great for wildlife too with a variety of seabirds, grey seals and dolphins to look out for. The final section runs from Tresaith to Penbryn passing the caravan park on the way. Here you'll find a 1.5 mile (2.4 km) long sandy beach owned by the National Trust. The cliff tops here are also quite steep, providing fine views over Cardigan Bay. To extend the walk you can continue east to Llangrannog where you can climb to the Pendinas Lochtyn hillfort. See the Aberporth to Llangrannog Coastal Path Walk for more details. If you head west along the coast path you can visit the lovely town of Cardigan and the 13th century Cilgerran castle on the River Teifi Estuary.",
