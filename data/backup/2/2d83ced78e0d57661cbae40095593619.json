  "description": "This lovely circular walk explores the area around the Scottish Border town of Peebles. The scenic route takes you along both sides of the River Tweed, visiting the historic castle and several features of the old Caledonian Railway. Along the way there are some splendid views of the surrounding hills and countryside to enjoy. Starting in the town you head west along the riverside path to the old castle and Hay Lodge Park. The walk then passes the disused railway viaduct before coming to the old Lyne Station and viaduct. Here you cross the river and head east along the other bank. This will take you past the Manor Bridge before coming to South Park Wood. You can then enter the Neidpath Tunnel (torch recommended) or follow the woodland trails through the wood if you prefer. Shortly after you pass the castle again before crossing the river and returning to the town. To continue your walking in the area head into the Pentland Hills and enjoy a waterside walk around the pretty Portmore Loch. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Peebles. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area. Also see the youtube channel of David Wheater who created the video below.",
