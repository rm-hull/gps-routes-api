  "description": "This short circular walk provides great views over Loch Torridon in the Torridon Hills. The walk starts from the Torridon Inn car park and takes you through woodland trails to the shoreline. Here you can enjoy the views across the loch to the surrounding mountains of Beinn Alligin and Eilean Chasgaig. It's a great place for wildlife with herons, oystercatchers and otters to look out for. To continue your walking around the loch head west to visit the Shieldaig Peninsula. There's fine views to Shieldaig Island and Shieldaig Loch in this lovely area.",
