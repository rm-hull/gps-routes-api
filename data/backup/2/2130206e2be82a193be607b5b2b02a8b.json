  "description": "Enjoy an easy, waterside walk around this lovely reservoir near Leeds. The walk begins in the car park on Stair Foot lane in Adel Woods and follows the Dales Way past Sand Moor golf course to the reservoir. You'll pass through Eccup and then follow a bridleway to Owlet Hall before turning south and enjoying waterside sections along the eastern and southern edges of the reservoir. The walk then passes Alwoodley Old Hall before a woodland section returns you to the Dales Way. The area is well known for being a great place for birdwatching. In particular look out for Red Kites as you make you're way round the reservoir. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Leeds Country Way at Eccup and follow it to the splendid Harewood House where you will find 100 acres of landscaped gardens. If you follow it west then you will soon come to the lovely Golden Acre Park. Here you can pick up the Meanwood Valley Trail which will take you to Woodhouse Moor in Leeds city centre, via Meanwood Park and Adel Woods. A short distance to the east is the lovely Hetchell Woods Nature Reserve. The site includes the fascinating historic site of Pompocali where there are extensive earthworks on the course of an old Roman Road.",

      "content": "Just to the north of the reservoir you'll find the handily placed New Inn. The friendly pub does really good food and has a cosy fire indoors. Outdoors there's a large garen area to relax in on warmer days. To reach the pub just head past Thorn Bush Farm at the north western corner of the water. The pub is located on Eccup Lane with a postcode of LS16 8AU for your sat navs."

      "content": "Adel Woods at the start of the route is well worth some further exploration. There's lots of nice trails with a wonderful variety of habitats \u2013 woodland, open meadows, heathland, two streams, a pond and a large bog with unusual plant species. If you're coming by public transport one nice way of visiting the reservoir is to catch the train to Hosforth station. Near here you can pick up the Leeds Country Way and follow it east to Golden Acre Park and the reservoir. It's a couple of miles but it's a great way to visit two of the highlights of the area without the car. The Bramhope Circular Walk visits the reservoir and Golden Acre Park from the nearby village. The attractive settlement is located just north of the park and includes a fine 18th century pub. You can follow the Ebor Way from here to the popular viewpoints at Otley Chevin Country Park, another of the area's walking highlights. Just to the north west you can pay a visit to one of the architectural highlights of the area at Arthington Viaduct. The historic Grade II listed structure is well worth a visit with some nice walks along the Wharfe to enjoy."
