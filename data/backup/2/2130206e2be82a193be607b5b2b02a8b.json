    "description": "Enjoy an easy, waterside walk around this lovely reservoir near Leeds. The walk begins in the car park on Stair Foot lane in Adel Woods and follows the Dales Way past Sand Moor golf course to the reservoir. You'll pass through Eccup and then follow a bridleway to Owlet Hall before turning south and enjoying waterside sections along the eastern and southern edges of the reservoir. The walk then passes Alwoodley Old Hall before a woodland section returns you to the Dales Way. The area is well known for being a great place for birdwatching. In particular look out for Red Kites as you make you're way round the reservoir. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Leeds Country Way at Eccup and follow it to the splendid Harewood House where you will find 100 acres of landscaped gardens. If you follow it west then you will soon come to the lovely Golden Acre Park . Here you can pick up the Meanwood Valley Trail which will take you to Woodhouse Moor in Leeds city centre, via Meanwood Park and Adel Woods . A short distance to the east is the lovely Hetchell Woods Nature Reserve. The site includes the fascinating historic site of Pompocali where there are extensive earthworks on the course of an old Roman Road.",
