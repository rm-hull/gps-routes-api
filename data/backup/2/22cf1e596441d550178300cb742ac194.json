The intention of the fort was to hold guns which could fire on ships at sea. Whilst its guns were upgraded in the late 19th century they did not keep pace with the advances in naval guns at the time. This photograph shows the southwestern aspect of the fort. The fort and its surrounds now contain rife ranges for military practice."

      "content": "The Finnygook Inn is located just off the route at Crafthole but worth a small detour. The historic 15th century coaching inn has some excellent views over the Tamar valley to the St Germans River. There's a fine old interior with low-beamed ceilings and a wealth of brass and copper ornaments. The name refers to the resident ghost (gook) of a local smuggler, Silas Finney, who was hung and thrown down the well (now under the kitchen) when his gang returned from a spell of transportation after he turned king's evidence against them. Outside is a seating area with standard garden furniture and a marquee that can been used by customers for functions and shelter from inclement weather at other times. There's more wonderful scenic views from here as well. You can find them at postcode PL11 3BN for your sat navs. The pub is dog friendly."

      "content": "About Portwinkle:- The village with its rich maritime heritage, has a history steeped in fishing. It still showcases the remnants of its 17th-century pilchard cellars, which have been ingeniously incorporated into residential buildings. Its historic harbor is a focal point, providing access to two beautiful beaches. Despite the absence of shops within the village, apart from the beach car park cafe, residents can conveniently access a post office located in the nearby village of Crafthole. The Whitsand Bay Hotel, formerly known as Thanckes House, which was originally situated in Torpoint, was carefully dismantled and reconstructed in Portwrinkle. Regrettably, the hotel closed its doors in 2018. However, as of 2022, the Grade II listed building remains standing, awaiting plans for redevelopment. To the west of the village, Eglarooze Cliff has earned the distinction of being designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to its remarkable biological significance. The cliff is a habitat for two endangered plant species listed in the Red Data Book: the slender bird's-foot trefoil and carrot broomrape. This natural wonder adds to the village's charm and showcases its commitment to preserving the environment."
