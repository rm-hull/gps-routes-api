  "description": "This circular walk visits the noteworthy Cross Fell, the highest point of the Pennine Range and the highest peak in England outside of the Lake District. The walk begins in the village of Kirkland and takes you to the 893 metres (2,930\u00a0ft) summit using bridleways and the Pennine Way . You start off a few miles west of the hill, in the little settlement of Kirkland where some parking is available on the village roads. You then follow footpaths to Cocklock Scar and Skirwith Fell, passing the Iron Well Spring on the way. At Skirwith Fell you turn right to the summit of Cross Fell, passing Cross Fell spring as you go. From the summit there are magnificent views of the Eden Valley, the Solway Firth, the Scottish mountains and the mountains of the Lake District. The route continues to Crowdundle Head where you have the option of returning to Kirkland or continuing along the Pennine Way to Little Dun Fell and Great Dun Fell . From Crowdundle Head you descend to Kirkland Fell, Wildboar Scar, Grumply Hill and Tottle Hill, following the Littledale beck for a while. The route then bears right to return to Kirkland. This is a challenging walk on mostly well defined paths. It's best attempted in fine weather as the area can be quite inhospitable in rough conditions. If you'd like to continue your walking in the North Pennines AONB then you could head to the nearby Cow Green Reservoir and Cauldron Snout Waterfall for some waterside walking.",
