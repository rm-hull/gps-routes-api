    "description": "Enjoy a lovely walk around this coastal nature reserve in Poole , Dorset. The walk begins next to the Sandbanks to Shell Bay chain ferry where parking is available. You then head into the reserve on walking trails some of which are way-marked. The trails take you through dunes and heathland where you will find a variety of birdlife flying between the trees and bushes. The purple bell heather and yellow gorse are particularly delightful in the summer months. The walk also visits the Little Sea - a large lake which attracts water loving birds. You can observe them in one of the bird hides on the edge of this lovely peaceful place. There are fabulous views of the islands of Poole Harbour including Brownsea Island , Furzey Island and Green Island. On a clear day you should also be able to see Bournemouth Pier and the Isle of Wight. The South West Coast Path passes the reserve so you could pick this up and head towards Old Harry Rocks and Swanage. From Sandbanks you can catch the ferry to Brownsea Island where you can enjoy more peaceful walking and wildlife. You are also very close to Rempstone Heath and Godlingstone Heath where there are more nice heathland trails to try. The latter includes the noteworthy Agglestone Rock . The large sandstone block commands wonderful views across the heaths to the coast.",
