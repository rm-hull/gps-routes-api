  "description": "This South Oxfordshire based village is a nice place to start a woodland and countryside walk. The village is located near Wallingford and Streatley in the Chiltern Hills AONB so there's plenty of local options for stretching your legs. This circular walk explores the expansive area of Chiltern beech woodland located just south of the village. There's miles of peaceful trails here ideal for leisure or dog walking. Look out for a wide variety of woodland birds as you make your way along the network of footpaths and bridle tracks. To continue your walking in the area head south west to visit the River Thames and the wonderful Basildon Park . Scroll down for a list of further walks near and around Woodcote.",
