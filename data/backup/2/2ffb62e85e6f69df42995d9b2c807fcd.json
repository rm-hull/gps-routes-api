This quartz line also marks a change in the angle of the strata from near horizontal in the foreground to about 30\u00ba in the further rockface. This beach is very interesting both geologically and palaeontologically as a wander along the beach will turn up many fossils especially traces of ammonites."

  "description": "This circular walk explores a beautiful area of coast and countryside in the Quantocks. The walk starts at the large car park just north of Kilve. It's a short walk from here to the fascinating Kilve Beach. Part of the Jurassic coastline the beach is a good place for fossil hunting. You'll also pass the Oil retort which was built in 1924 to burn the oil rich shale beds here. Though the venture failed the old building remains. The footpath passes along the coast with great views of the cliffs and surrounding countryside. You then turn inland to the village of East Quantoxhead. It's a pretty place with thatched cottages, a medieval tithe barn, a duck pond, a mill house and an interesting manor house with a medieval tower. The route then leaves the village and passes more countryside and some woodland before returning you to the car park.",

You could follow the West Somerset Coast path east to Lilstock Beach and the power station at Hinkley Point. Heading west would take you towards Watchet. The nearby village has an interesting maritime history with many old buildings including two museums and an ancient 16th century inn. The Coleridge Way can be picked up at nearby West Quantoxhead. The epic trail follows in the footsteps of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, visiting some of the places that inspired his works. Heading south would take you to the pretty village of Holford where you could climb to the Dowsborough Camp Iron Age Hill Fort."
