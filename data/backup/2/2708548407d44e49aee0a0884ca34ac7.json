The Trust provides facilities such as parking, disabled access, pathways, and viewing platforms, making it a popular site in the Lake District. There are also toilets, a caf\u00e9, and a visitor centre. A public footpath from Dockray leads to the waterfall, and a Wish Tree, where visitors embed coins into a fallen log, can be found along the route. In 2015, a jetty opened nearby for Ullswater 'Steamers', enhancing accessibility."

    "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Aira Force waterfall next to Ullswater Lake in the Lake District National Park. The National Trust owned area is very popular and a must see if you're visiting this part of the National Park. You start off in the car park by the lake and then head through ancient woodland to the spectacular 65ft high waterfall. You can cross a bridge over the falls for fantastic views. You then head through Gowbarrow Park before reaching the lakeside where you can follow a waterside path back to the start point. As well as the splendid falls there's also a series of lovely woodland trails with Himalayan firs, red squirrels and views of the Aira Beck. The walk can be extended by picking up the Ullswater Way which runs past the falls. You could reach the falls by following the waymarked trail from nearby Glenridding or Patterdale as an alternative start point. See the Glenridding to Aira Force Walk for full details of this route. In Glenridding you can also pick up the Howtown to Glenridding Walk which is another major highlight of the area. Gowbarrow Fell sits just above the falls and is a great place to continue your walk. You can try our circular walk through Gowbarrow Park where you can enjoy wonderful views over the lake and surrounding fells.",
