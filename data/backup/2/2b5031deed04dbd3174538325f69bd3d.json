      "caption": "Cambus O'May carpark lookout. The area is teeming with wildlife, offering a chance to spot some iconic Scottish species. Red squirrels are a highlight, often seen darting among the trees or feeding on pinecones. Birdlife is abundant, with species such as crossbills, crested tits, and great spotted woodpeckers making their home in the forest. The open spaces and heathland surrounding the woodland also attract raptors, including buzzards and the occasional golden eagle. In the quieter parts of the forest, walkers may catch a glimpse of roe deer, while smaller mammals like red foxes and pine martens are also present. The nearby River Dee, which borders the forest, supports aquatic life and attracts additional species, such as dippers and herons, creating a well-rounded habitat for diverse flora and fauna."

  "description": "This circular walk begins at the main car park of Cambus O\u2019 May Forest near Ballater, Aberdeenshire. A well-maintained path leads you through serene pine woodlands, circling the peaceful lochans that reflect the surrounding trees. Along the way, smaller trails branch off to follow babbling burns, creating a tranquil atmosphere with occasional wooden footbridges. Informative signs along the route highlight the local wildlife and flora, including red squirrels and Scots pine. This gentle circuit is perfect for all abilities, offering a mix of forest and waterside scenery. There's also some fine views of the surrounding Cairngorms mountains and countryside to enjoy along the way. To continue your walking in the area head east to visit Loch Kinord and the Muir of Dinnet Nature Reserve where there are more fine waterside walks and lots of birdlife to see.",
