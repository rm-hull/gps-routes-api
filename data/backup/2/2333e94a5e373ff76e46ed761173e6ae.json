    "description": "Visit this Neolithic henge monument and enjoy some lovely moorland scenery on this fascinating circular walk in the Peak District. The site is located a few miles west of Youlgreave . You can park at Upper Oldhams Farm just off Long Rake. Walk through the farm (there is a \u00a31 charge per person) and then climb towards Arbor Low. The limestone circle sits in an elevated position with super views over the White Peak area of the Peak District. The henge is one of the most well preserved in Britain with 50 large limestone slabs and fragments. It's an atmospheric place, thought to date back to 2500BC to 1500 BC. After you have explored the stone circle you can head south west to Gib Hill where you will find an ancient burial mound. The High Peak Trail and the Midshires Way both pass close to the site at Parsley Hay.\nYou could pick up these long distance footpaths to extend your walking in the area. Heading north west will take you to Pomeroy while heading south takes you towards Hartington and the Biggin Dale Nature Reserve. Just over a mile to the north you'll find the beautiful Lathkill Dale . This is a great place to extend your walking in the White Peak. There are wonderful limestone cliffs and the rushing waters of the River Lathkill to enjoy.",
