Excavations elsewhere suggest that this area may have had its own layer of defences such as sharpened stakes,at least where they were needed for defence. The outer courses of often triangular-shaped stones were in-filled with more random shaped and sized stones, possibly a more accurate restoration than seen elsewhere along the Roman Wall. The vallum can be seen in the field to the left (south side). Why does this short section of the wall have such a pronounced bend (just behind)? Whatever the reason, it did help this small section survive the road building that destroyed many miles of the structure west from Newcastle."

  "description": "Starting in Wallsend near the east coast of England, head across the country to Bowness-on-Solway along this wonderful trail that follows the famous Roman wall. The trail runs for a distance of 84 miles (135 km), following close to the wall for most of its length. It's fairly flat for most of the way so it's quite an easy walk in good weather. The trail mostly passes through open countryside and farmland but there are city sections through Newcastle Upon Tyne and Carlisle. Highlights includes the well preserved fort at Birdoswald where there's an excellent English Heritage Visitor Centre and museum. Housesteads is another of the trails highlights. Here there's a barracks block, hospital, Commander's House, granaries and communal toilets which are all still visible today.",
