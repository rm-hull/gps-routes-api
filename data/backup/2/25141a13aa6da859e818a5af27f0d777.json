  "description": "This walk explores East Harptree Woods near the village of East Harptree in Somerset. The village is located in the Mendips Hills overlooking the Valley of the River Chew. You can find the woods just to the south west of the settlement. There's a public car park at the woods or you can stroll down from the village through Harptree Combe. At the site there are a series of peaceful woodland trails leading to the Smitham Chimney. The photogenic 19th century structure is a reminder of the lead mining history of the area. It is a Grade II listed building and is an added attraction to this quiet woodland area. The Monarch's Way runs past the eastern side of the woods. You could pick up this trail and follow it north to neighbouring Compton Martin to extend the walk. Here you will find a noteworthy Norman church, an historic 16th century pub and the picturesque millpond which is the source of the Congresbury Yeo River.",
