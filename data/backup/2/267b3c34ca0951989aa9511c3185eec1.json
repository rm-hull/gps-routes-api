  "description": "Explore the pretty gardens surrounding this 17th century house in Richmond. The recently restored gardens include a productive kitchen garden with many heritage crops, the maze-like 'Wilderness', an orangery and a number of summerhouses. The house is located by the River Thames so you can enjoy a riverside walk before heading to the nearby Ham Common. Inside Ham House there is a superb collection of paintings, furniture and textiles, acquired over 400 years ago. After your visit you could catch Hammerton's Ferry from just outside the house to the other side of the Thames where you can visit Marble Hill Park with its 18th century Palladian villa and 66 acres of parkland.",
