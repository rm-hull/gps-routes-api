    "description": "This market town is located in the north east of Wales in the county of Denbighshire. The town is located in a fine spot near to the excellent walking country of the Clwydian Hills . This circular walk around Denbigh explores the town centre, the historic castle and the town walls. The Welsh name of the town translates to \"Little Fortress\"; a reference to the castle. The structure was built to control the lordship of Denbigh after the conquest of Wales by King Edward I in 1282. The site includes a drawbridge into a triple-towered gatehouse and portcullis. It connects to the town walls, which remain largely intact and stretch for around 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) around the old town. From the elevated position of the castle there are fine views of the surrounding countryside and the Denbigh Moors.",
