  "description": "This Gloucestershire based village sits close to the Welsh Border in the Forest of Dean and the River Wye Valley. This walk from the village passes the historic castle before heading west to the River Wye for some waterside walking. The walk starts at the castle in the village. The castle dates back to the 12th century and was a significant royal castle near the border with Wales. It was previously used as a royal administrative centre for the Forest of Dean . Today it is  as a youth hostel but is also open to the public under the care of English Heritage. The route then follows footpaths west to meet with the river at Bigsweir Bridge. The noteworthy bridge was built in 1827 and crosses the river Wye between St. Briavels in Enlgand to Llandogo in Wales. At the bridge you can pick up the Wye Valley Walk and follow the waymarked trail south to Brockweir . The walk can be extended here by visiting Tintern Abbey to the south. The ruined abbey is one of the major highlights of the area and well worth a visit. This route picks up the Offa's Dyke Path and follows it north across St Briavels Common before returning to the village.",
