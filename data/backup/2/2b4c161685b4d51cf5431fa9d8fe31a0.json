  "description": "This Somerset based village is located near the historic city of Bath. It has some lovely waterside trails along the Somerset Coal Canal, the Kennet and Avon Canal and the River Avon. Monkton Combe is also noted for its prominent public school which owns several of the historic buildings you can see in the village. This circular walk from the village visits Dundas Aqueduct, the Kennet and Avon Canal, Avoncliff and the neighbouring village of Freshford. The walk starts in the village and heads east to visit the impressive Dundas Aqueduct. The photogenic structure is a Scheduled Ancient Monument carrying the Kennet and Avon Canal over the River Avon (the Somerset / Wiltshire border) and the Wessex Main Line railway from Bath to Westbury. The route then picks up a waterside path along the River Avon, heading south past Conkwell Wood before coming to Avoncliff. Here you'll find the 18th century Avoncliff Aqueduct, a Grade II listed structure. From the top there are some excellent views over the surrounding countryside. After crossing the river you head west past Avoncliff Wood to the village of Freshford where theres a 16th century pub and a train station. The final section passes Limpley Stoke and Chatleigh House before returning to the village.",
