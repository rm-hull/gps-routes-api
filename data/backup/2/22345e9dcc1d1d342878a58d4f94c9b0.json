    "description": "This walk visits the Grade II listed Pitstone Windmill, near Ivinghoe in Buckinghamshire. Start the walk from the car park just to the south of the village if Ivinghoe. From here it is a short stroll to the west to visit the mill. The historic mill dates back to the 17th century and was splendidly restored in the 1960s. Today you can explore both the inner and outer workings of the windmill and learn about the grinding of the flour in the milling process. It's in a very picturesque spot, surrounding by lovely Chilterns countryside. You can extend your outing by heading south and climbing to Pitstone Hill. There's another car park just down the road from the mill where you can pick up trails to the viewpoint.",
