  "description": "This walk explores the beautiful Murlough National Nature Reserve near Newcastle in Northern Ireland. The reserve is managed by the National Trust so there's a car park, visitor centre, and a network of well laid out footpaths. The reserve consists of a 6000 year old sand dune system, woodland, heath and a wonderful beach. The views across Dundram Inner Bay towards the Mourne Mountains are also exceptional. The reserve is great for wildlife watching with a wide variety of wintering wildfowl and waders to look out for on the coast. There's also 720 species of butterflies and moths to look out for around the pretty wildlflowers meadows. There's lots of good options for extending your walking in the Newcastle area. You could head to Tollymore Forest Park just to the south west of the reserve. The fantastic 1600 acre park contains an arboretum, the Shimna River and two forested hills known as the Drinns. Also nearby are the splendid climbs to Slieve Donard, Slieve Binnian in the Mourne Mountains. Castlewellan Forest Park is also not far away.",
