  "description": "This walk visits a remote waterfall in the Northumberland National Park. Davidson's Linn is located very near the border with Scotland and The Cheviot in a beautiful part of the national park. The walk starts from the Wedder Leap car park which is located a few miles south of the falls. From here you can pick up trails heading north along the Border County Ride. You'll pass the hills of Barrow Law, Ward Law and Hazely Law before following woodland trails east to Davidson's Linn. It's a lovely scenic spot where you can enjoy a little paddle and a picnic before returning on the same paths. The route to Windy Gyle starts from the same car park so you can extend your walking in the area by climbing to this excellent viewpoint. The Usway Burn also flows through this section of the park and provides an opportunity for a pleasant waterside walk.",
