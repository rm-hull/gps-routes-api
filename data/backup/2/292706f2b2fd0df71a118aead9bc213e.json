  "description": "This walk visits the historic Lambton Park Estate in Tyne and Wear. The wider estate has miles of riverside footpaths and and an old castle to see. It is only open on certain days but there are public footpaths running along the eastern side of the estate. The castle is a stately home, and the ancestral seat of the Lambton family, the Earls of Durham. This walk starts in Fatfield next to the river and follow the Great North Forest Trail along the eastern edge of the estate. It will take you past Biddick Hall to the Bowes entrance and car park. If the park is open to visitors you can explore 11 km of permissive seasonal walks. Here you can enjoy splendid views along the River Wear Gorge to the Castle, taking in the old racecourse, woodland and open parkland. See the link below for more details and opening times.",
