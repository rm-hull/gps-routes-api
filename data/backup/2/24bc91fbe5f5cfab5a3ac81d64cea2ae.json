  "description": "This pretty village in the Mendip Hills has some lovely riverside trails, large areas of local woodland and a hill climb to an old fort above the settlement. This walk from the village takes you along the River Yeo to nearby Wrington, using a section of the Two Rivers Way. You can start of at Congresbury Bridge and follow the waymarked trail east for about 2.5 miles, passing Urchinwood Manor and the picturesque waterwheel at Iwood on the way. You could also head north west along the river to visit Hewish if you prefer.",

      "content": "The popular Strawberry Line runs through the village. This shared walking and cycling path runs from Yatton to Cheddar along a disused railway line. You can see the remains of the old station in the village and pick up the trail here. At the end of the route you can visit Cheddar Reservoir, the historic town of Axbridge and the famous Cheddar Gorge. Just to the north of the village you can enjoy a climb to Cadbury Camp Hill Fort where there are some fine views over the area. Near here there's also the popular Goblin Combe. The nature reserve includes hundreds of acres of woodland, large areas of open grassland, limestone cliffs and some moderate climbs with great views towards the Mendip Hills.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Mendip Hills Walks page."
