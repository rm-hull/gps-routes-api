    "description": "This walk takes you along the historic walls in the city of Londonderry. Derry is noteworthy as the only remaining completely walled city in Ireland and one of the finest examples of a European Walled City. The Walls were built from 1613-1618 by the Irish Society as defences for early 17th century settlers from England and Scotland. You can follow an elevated path along the Ramparts which provides some excellent views over the city. The trail runs for about a mile taking you past a series of signifcant historical sites including the cannons at the Double Bastion and the 17th century St Columb's Cathedral.",
