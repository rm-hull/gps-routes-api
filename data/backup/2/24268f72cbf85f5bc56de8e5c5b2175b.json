  "description": "This circular walk explores the area surrounding this attractive reservoir in Dartmoor. It's a place well worth exploring on foot or by bike. As well as waterside paths along the reservoir there are miles of lovely woodland trails, brooks, streams and waterfalls in the surrounding area. You'll also pass a number of rugged Dartmoor Tors and the River Meavy at the western end of the reservoir. This route starts at the Nosworthy Bridge car park at the eastern end of the reservoir and heads to the dam along the trail at the southern side of the water. You'll pass mixed woodland and Sheeps Tor - one of Dartmoor's most imposing tors. The route then passes through the mixed woodland on the northern side of the reservoir, passing Peek Hill, Leather Tor and Sharpitor. The final section takes you into Norsworthy Woods to Leather Tor Bridge and then back to Nosworthy Bridge.  Look out for Dartmoor ponies on your way through this lovely area. The Devonport Leat runs into the reservoir and makes for a nice extension to the route. The leat was constructed in the 1790s to carry fresh drinking water from the high ground of Dartmoor to the expanding dockyards at Plymouth Dock. Footpaths will take you through woodland north of the reservoir to the aqueduct of the River Meavy on Walkhampton Common. If you enjoy this route then you could head to the nearby Plymbridge Woods for a great trail running along a disused railtrack. You can also enjoy great views back down to the water on the climb to Sheepstor. The walk to the summit starts from the same car park, taking you up to Yellowmead Down on the eastern side of the reservoir. Burrator Reservoir is located near to Yelverton and Tavistock.",
