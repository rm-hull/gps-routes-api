The area is home to a variety of plant species, with notable examples including heather, bracken, and gorse. In wetter areas, you might find mosses and ferns thriving in the damper conditions. The forested sections feature trees like oak, birch, and coniferous species, adding to the area's biodiversity. The reservoir itself supports aquatic plants such as water lilies and other submerged vegetation."

The reservoir is also a haven for mammals, including species like foxes, deer, and rabbits, and its proximity to Dartmoor means it shares its wildlife with the national park. Small mammals like squirrels and hedgehogs can be found in the woodlands, while otters are occasionally spotted around the water's edge. The diverse habitat supports a healthy insect population, which in turn feeds a variety of birds and mammals."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the area surrounding this attractive reservoir in Dartmoor. It's a place well worth exploring on foot or by bike. As well as waterside paths along the reservoir there are miles of lovely woodland trails, brooks, streams and waterfalls in the surrounding area. You'll also pass a number of rugged Dartmoor Tors and the River Meavy at the western end of the reservoir. This route starts at the Nosworthy Bridge car park at the eastern end of the reservoir and heads to the dam along the trail at the southern side of the water. You'll pass mixed woodland and Sheeps Tor - one of Dartmoor's most imposing tors. The route then passes through the mixed woodland on the northern side of the reservoir, passing Peek Hill, Leather Tor and Sharpitor. The final section takes you into Norsworthy Woods to Leather Tor Bridge and then back to Nosworthy Bridge. Look out for Dartmoor ponies on your way through this lovely area. The Devonport Leat runs into the reservoir and makes for a nice extension to the route. The leat was constructed in the 1790s to carry fresh drinking water from the high ground of Dartmoor to the expanding dockyards at Plymouth Dock. Footpaths will take you through woodland north of the reservoir to the aqueduct of the River Meavy on Walkhampton Common. If you enjoy this route then you could head to the nearby Plymbridge Woods for a great trail running along a disused railtrack. You can also enjoy great views back down to the water on the climb to Sheepstor. The walk to the summit starts from the same car park, taking you up to Yellowmead Down on the eastern side of the reservoir. Burrator Reservoir is located near to Yelverton and Tavistock.",

      "content": "Just to the south west of the reservoir there's the noteworthy Royal Oak in Meavy. The pub has fine credentials having been voted the 2019 Country Pub of the Year by Plymouth CAMRA. It's located in a delightful spot, next to Meavy Church and the pretty village green. There's a splendid outdoor seating area with a wide lawn where you can sit and enjoy a drink on fine days. The pub also has an interesting history having been a former 15th century Church house inn. It takes its name from the oak tree on the village green which is some 800 years old. This is one of the few remaining traditional Dartmoor inns with a flagstone floor, oak beams and a large open fireplace. Some of the seats are pews from adjacent church. You can find the pub less than half a mile south of the reservoir dam with a postcode of PL20 6PJ for your sat navs.  Pictured above, the Royal Oak pub and Meavy village green. A lovely place to relax after your walk on a summer day."

      "content": "On the western side of the water there's South West Lakes Trust Burrator Discovery Centre. There's a wealth of information here with displays, spoken history and an interactive screen, engaging all ages, from toddlers to grandparents. The waterfall is also located in this area. One of the hidden gems of the area lies just a few miles north of the site at Foggintor Quarry. Here you'll find a tranquil lake surrounded by the atmospheric quarry ruins. There's also the option of continuing north west to visit King's Tor and Great Staple Tor where there are more great views to enjoy. Just to the south east there's Gutter Tor where there's a nice circular walk from the conveniently positioned car park. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dartmoor Walks page."
