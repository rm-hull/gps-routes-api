  "description": "This walk visits Ramsden Reservoir near the Yorkshire town of Holmfirth. You can start the walk at the public car park at the northern end of the reservoir. From here you can pick up trails heading along the water where there are fine views of the surrounding forestry and hills. It's a very tranquil area and with easy paths, it's perfect for a peaceful Sunday afternoon stroll. Just to the north of the site you'll find Brownhill Reservoir and Digley Reservoir where there is another nice walking trail to try. You can reach it by following the waymarked Kirklees Way north for about half a mile. Follow the trail east and it will soon take you to Holme Styes Reservoir .",
