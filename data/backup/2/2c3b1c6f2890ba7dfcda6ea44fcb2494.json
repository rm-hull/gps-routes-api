  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Loe Bar and Loe Pool, near Helston , in Cornwall. The pool is notable as largest natural freshwater lake in Cornwall. The walk starts from the Fair Car Park just south of Helston, close to the Coronation Lake. From here you can pick up a trail heading south through the Loe Valley to the beautiful Loe Pool. The trails will take you through the woodland running alongside the western side of the lake before coming to the beach at Loe Bar. On this section you will pass the National Trust's Penrose Estate where there's a manor house and a walled garden to see. At Loe Bar you pass along the beach before following another footpath along the eastern side of the lake. This will take you past Carminowe Creek, Pentire Wood and Degibna Wood and Lower Nansloe before returning to the car park. The area is great for wildlife so keep your eyes peeled for birds including Pochard, Widgeon, Teal, Mallard, Tufted Duck, Coot and Shoveler as you make your way around the site. You could extend the walk by heading west to explore the village of Porthleven with its lovely harbour.",
