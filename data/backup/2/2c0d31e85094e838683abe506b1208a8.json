  "description": "Climb the Greensand Ridge and enjoy wonderful views over Bedfordshire in this pretty park in Ampthill. The park has good footpaths taking you to the high points and then around the pretty lake. There are also woodland trails in Laurel Wood and the option of extending your walk to the nearby Cooper's Hill which lies just to the south. In the park you will also find Katherine\u2019s Cross - a memorial to Katherine of Aragon who stayed at the former Ampthill Castle. If you would like to continue your walk you could pick up the Greensand Ridge long distance walking trail which runs through the park. If you follow it east you will soon come to Maulden Woods where there are lots of nice woodland walking trails through semi-natural broadleaf woodland, acidic grassland and conifer plantations.",
