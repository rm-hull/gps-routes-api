  "description": "A circular cycle or walk around the beautiful Windsor Great Park in Surrey. The park includes 5,000 acres of parkland, which includes a Deer Park, lakes, avenues, gardens, woodland and open grassland. National Cycle Network route 4 runs right through the park while the Three Castles Walk runs along the Long Walk Avenue where there are fabulous views of Windsor Castle. Cyclists please note that cycles are not permitted on the Long Walk. If you'd like to continue your exercise you could head to Virginia Water Lake. This large man made lake is located in the southern end of the park. It has a delightful walking trail running around its perimeter. Also of interest are the beautiful Valley Gardens. Located next to the lake they consist of 250 acres of landscaped gardens and woodlands and a series of well defined walking trails. You can also enjoy a walk along the Thames Path from Windsor to Dorney Lake. The lake has a nice surfaced cycling and walking trail to try. The Jubilee River also runs past Dorney. The river has a great waterside cycling and walking trail running from Maidenhead to Eton. Also of interest is our Windsor Circular Walk which will take you to Eton Wick and the famous Eton College.",

      "content": "Across the river to the north in Buckinghamshire there's two fine country parks in the shape of Black Park Country Park and Langley Park Country Park. There's miles of good cycling and walking trails through the woodland in these parks. Langley Park's rhododendron gardens and Arboretum are also particularly lovely. The Three Castles Path starts/finishes at the castle in the town. This historically themed long distance trail will take you from the castle at Windsor to Winchester Castle, visiting the ruined Odiham Castle on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Berkshire Walks and the Surrey Walks pages."
