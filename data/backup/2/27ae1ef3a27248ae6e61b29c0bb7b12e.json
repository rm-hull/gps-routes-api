  "description": "Enjoy wonderful views over the Wye Valley from this well known viewpoint on the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire border. From the elevated position you have a great view of the beautiful wooded gorge below. It's also a popular spot for birdwatching with peregrine falcons, buzzards, goshawks and hobbies regularly seen. The area is great for walking and cycling with miles of waymarked woodland trails and riverside paths to try. This circular walk starts from the car park and follows good footpaths to the viewpoint. You then continue along the river through the woodland, passing Huntsham Hill on the way. A section along the Perigrine Path then takes you along the River Wye before heading through Riddings Wood to the car park. There are several other waymarked trails in the area which visit the Iron Age Hillfort and Mailscot Wood. There is also a nature trail with nature boards through an attractive section of mixed woodland. You can buy refreshments from the excellent Log cabin cafe. This route is designed for walkers but cyclists can try the Symonds Yat Rock Cycle Trail which runs for about 3 miles from the campsite. You can also pick up the Perigrine Path cycle route which runs through Symonds Yat. If you would like to extend your walk then you can continue along the river using the Wye Valley Walk. If you head west you can visit the mysterious King Arthur's Cave and then cross the England-Wales border and arrive at Monmouth where you can visit the splendid Kymin Hill for more wonderful views over the area. You can reach the rock from Monmouth by following the 8 mile Monmouth to Symonds Yat Walk. If you head east you'll soon come to Lower Lydbrook and the ruinous Norman medieval Goodrich Castle. Here you can climb Coppet Hill for more great views into Wales.",
