    "description": "This walk climbs to Ingleborough Cave and Ingleborough Mountain from the Yorkshire village of Clapham . It's a challenging 4 mile hike to the top of the mountain from the village centre. The walk starts in the village and heads north on a nice footpath running along Clapham Beck. There's also a pretty artifical lake and some peaceful woodland trails on this opening section. The route then passes the famous Ingleborough Show Cave before ascending to Gaping Gill . This natural cave is one of the unmistakable landmarks on the southern slopes of the mountain. The cave is a striking 98-metre (322 ft) deep pothole with the stream Fell Beck flowing into it. The next stage takes you past Little Ingleborough before continuing to the Ingleborough summit. At (723 m or 2,372 ft) it is the second-highest mountain in the Yorkshire Dales. It's located in the south-western corner of the Yorkshire Dales, at the highest point of a triangle of land with corners at Ingleton, Ribblehead and Settle. The hill is connected to its nearest higher neighbour, Whernside, by a low col or mountain pass at Ribblehead at approximately 971 feet (296 m). On the summit you will find an Ordnance Survey trig point at the highest point, near the western corner. Just to the north is a well-built windshelter (cross-shaped to provide shelter whichever way the wind is blowing) with a toposcope built into its centre. This shows all the landmarks you can see from the summit including Wild Boar Fell, Great Shunner Fell , Great Whernside, Ilkley Moor, Kinder Scout and Scafell Pike in the Lake District. After taking in the wonderful views the route descends back to the village on the same paths. For a longer circular route see the Ingleborough Circular Walk from Clapham .",
