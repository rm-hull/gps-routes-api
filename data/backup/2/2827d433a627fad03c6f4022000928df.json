  "description": "This walk climbs to Ingleborough Cave and Ingleborough Mountain from the Yorkshire village of Clapham . It's a challenging 4 mile hike to the top of the mountain from the village centre. The walk starts in the village and heads north on a nice footpath running along Clapham Beck. There's also a pretty artifical lake and some peaceful woodland trails on this opening section. The route then passes the famous Ingleborough Show Cave before ascending to Gaping Gill . This natural cave is one of the unmistakable landmarks on the southern slopes of\u00a0the mountain.\u00a0The cave is a striking 98-metre (322\u00a0ft) deep\u00a0pothole\u00a0with the stream\u00a0Fell Beck\u00a0flowing into it. The next stage takes you past Little Ingleborough before continuing to the Ingleborough summit. At (723\u00a0m or 2,372\u00a0ft)\u00a0it is the\u00a0second-highest mountain\u00a0in the\u00a0Yorkshire Dales. It's located in the south-western corner of the\u00a0Yorkshire Dales, at the highest point of a triangle of land with corners at\u00a0Ingleton,\u00a0Ribblehead\u00a0and\u00a0Settle. The hill is connected to its nearest higher neighbour, Whernside, by a low col or\u00a0mountain pass\u00a0at Ribblehead at approximately 971 feet (296\u00a0m). On the summit you will find an\u00a0Ordnance Survey\u00a0trig point\u00a0at the highest point, near the western corner. Just to the north is a well-built windshelter (cross-shaped to provide shelter whichever way the wind is blowing) with a\u00a0toposcope\u00a0built into its centre. This shows all the landmarks you can see from the summit including Wild Boar Fell, Great Shunner Fell , Great Whernside, Ilkley Moor, Kinder Scout and Scafell Pike in the Lake District. After taking in the wonderful views the route descends back to the village on the same paths. For a longer circular route see the Ingleborough Circular Walk from Clapham .",
