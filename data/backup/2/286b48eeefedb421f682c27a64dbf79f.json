It's 4.5 miles long, of which 1.5 miles are in tunnel under Morwell Down: the canal was officially opened in 1817, after 14 years work. Steam engines and waterwheels cast in ironfoundries in the town were exported on the canal to Cornwall via Morwellham Quay and the river Tamar. The canal has a fall of about 1 foot per mile, which allows water from the river Tavy to flow towards Morwellham: the canal water once powered waterwheels along the route"

Quoting from the Devon County Council's plaque on Abbey Bridge:-\n\"A mediaeval bridge here served Tavistock Abbey. It was replaced in 1763 to accommodate the new turnpike road system. This bridge was widened in 1860 to carry increased traffic following the opening of the Great Western Railway station nearby.\"\nToday it carries the A386 road to and from Okehampton into the town centre.\nOn the left is the intake from the River Tavy that feeds the Tavistock Canal which has served Morwellham hydro power station since 1934. In 2008 a new automatic screening mechanism was installed (the green and grey shovel-like structure) that will prevent salmon smolts from entering the canal and becoming trapped, instead allowing them to swim down the Tavy to the sea."

  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll along the towpath of the Tavistock Canal on this easy walk in West Devon. The route starts at Tavistock Wharf and heads through the outskirts of the town towards Crowndale Farm, passing West Bridge on the way. You continue to the pretty Shillamill Aqueduct before finishing at Lumburn where the canal meets the River Lumburn. Along the way you will pass pretty locks, canalside cottages and old stone bridges. There are also sections through woodland and great views of the surrounding Devon countryside. If you'd like to continue your waterside walking in this area then you could head to the nearby Grenofen Bridge and visit Double Waters where the River Tavy meet the River Walkham. You could also pick up the West Devon Way which passes through Tavistock. The Abbot's Way long distance trail will take you from the ruins of Tavistock Abbey to Buckfast Abbey, 22 miles to the east of the town.",
