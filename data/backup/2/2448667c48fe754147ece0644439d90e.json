  "description": "This walk visits The Whaligoe Steps, located in Lybster, Caithness. The extraordinary stairway of 365 steps is carved into a cliffside, leading down to Whaligoe Haven, a natural harbour surrounded by 250-foot cliffs. Originally built in the late 18th century to support the herring industry, the steps were used by fisherwomen to haul heavy baskets of fish up the cliff, a testament to the area\u2019s industrious past. The terrain is steep and uneven, making the walk moderately challenging but rewarding. Proper footwear is essential, especially in wet or frosty weather when the steps can become slippery. From the top, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the dramatic coastline, where seabirds such as kittiwakes, razorbills, and fulmars are often spotted. At the harbour below, the atmosphere is serene, offering a sense of the area\u2019s rich maritime history. The surrounding flora includes hardy coastal plants adapted to the salty environment, and in spring and summer, wildflowers add colour to the landscape. You can continue your walking in the area by visiting the historic ruins of the 15th century Castle Sinclair Girnigoe or the wonderful rock formations at the Duncansby Stacks .",
