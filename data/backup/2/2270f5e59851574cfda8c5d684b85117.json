  "description": "Enjoy a walk around these attractive woods in Farnham , Surrey. In the woods you can visit the site of Ridley Scott's Robin Hood Film set from his 2010 film starring Russell Crowe (pictures below). You can also follow the trails south to RSPB Farnham Heath and the Rural Life Centre. The aim of the new heath is to benefit scarce heathland species such as nightjar, woodlark, Dartford warbler and tree pipit as well as species such as sand lizard. It's a nice place for a peaceful stroll with lots of different footpaths to choose from. There's pine woodland, heathland and lovely views of the surrounding area.There's lots of good options for extending your walking in the Surrey Hills. Just to the south you can visit the popular Frensham Ponds with its two fantastic large ponds. Head west and you can pick up miles of cycling and walking trails in the expansive Alice Holt Forest . A couple of miles south east there's more nice trails to try on Hankley Common near Elstead . The circular Tilford Walk starts from the attractive village and visits the common and Frensham Ponds.",
