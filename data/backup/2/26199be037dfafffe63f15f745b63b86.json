  "description": "Enjoy a short walk around this beautiful national nature reserve in Cambridgeshire. There are 500 acres to explore with habitats including wildflower meadows, mixed fen, marsh, reedbed, scrub, open water and woodland. There are several waymarked walking trails taking you around the reserve on wide grassy paths. You can stop at the bird hides and look out for a wide variety of wildlife before heading to Rothschild Bungalow - Charles Rothschild, a successful banker and wildlife enthusiast bought Woodwalton Fen in 1910 to preserve this lovely area. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Holme Fen National Nature Reserve. Woodwalton Fen is located between Peterborough and Huntingdon. The reserve is part of the larger Great Fen Wetland Project. You can visit the nearby Great Fen information point and try the lovely Dragonfly Trail. The 2 mile circular footpath is waymarked and includes ponds, woodland and lots of information points explaining the Great Fen project.",
