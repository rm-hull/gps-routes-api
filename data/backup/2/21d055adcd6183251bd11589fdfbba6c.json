  "description": "Follow the Thames Path from Tower Bridge to Greenwich on this riverside walk in London. The walk is just under 6 miles, starting on the iconic Tower Bridge. The suspension bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London. It was built in the late 19th century and consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway. Starting from the bridge you follow the signed trail east through Bermondsey and Deptford. Along the way you'll pass the marina at Greenland Dock and enjoy views of the Isle of Dogs. The route finishes at Greenwich Park which includes 180 acres of wide lawns, tree lined avenues, orchards and pretty gardens. You can also visit the Royal Observatory, the home of Greenwich Mean Time, the Prime Meridian and London's only Planetarium. The observatory played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation.",

You can find it in a fine location at the top of the hill by the Royal Observatory. Built in 1906 the octagonal building is topped by a dove-cot with a weather vane showing Nelson looking through his telescope. In fine weather make the most of the large garden at the front and rear. There's a good menu which includes freshly made stone-baked pizzas, soup, sandwiches and hearty hot dishes."
