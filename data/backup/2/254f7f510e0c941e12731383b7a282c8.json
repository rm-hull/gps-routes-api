  "description": "This pretty village in North Hertfordshire has some nice country trails along the scarp of the Icknield Way Path. It also includes the Ashwell Springs, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, which is notable as a source of the River Cam. There's several fine old buildings too including a 14th century church and the excellent Ashwell Museum which is set in an historic timber frame building dating from the Tudor period. This circular walk from the village explores the local countryside visiting the neighbouring villages of Steeple Morden and Guilden Morden. The walk starts in the village and follows the Icknield Way Path north east towards Upper Gatley End. Here you turn north to follow a public footpath to Steeple Morden, passing the windmill on the way. The route continues north to Guilden Morden before turning south west to link up with the Northfield Road country lane. Follow this south and it will take you back to Ashwell.",

      "content": "The long distance Hertfordshire Chain Walk can be picked up at Ashwell & Morden Train Station, to the south east of the village. The long distance waymarked trail provides an opportunity to further explore the area on foot. You could follow it south towards Kelshall and Therfield where you could explore the popular Royston Heath. Head south west and you could visit Stotfold with its picturesque mill on the River Ivel. The Kingfisher Way can also be picked up here. Just west of Stotfold you'll find the small town of Arlesey where you can explore the Arlesey Old Moat Nature Reserve on the River Hiz. Near here there's Henlow where there's a noteworthy 12th century church and the Champneys Health farm which is used by the rich and famous. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hertfordshire Walks page."
