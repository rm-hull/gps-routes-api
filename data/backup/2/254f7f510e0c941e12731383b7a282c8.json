  "description": "This pretty village in North Hertfordshire has some nice country trails along the scarp of the Icknield Way Path. It also includes the Ashwell Springs, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, which is notable as a source of the River Cam. There's several fine old buildings too including a 14th century church and the excellent Ashwell Museum which is set in an historic timber frame building dating from the Tudor period. This circular walk from the village explores the local countryside visiting the neighbouring villages of Steeple Morden and Guilden Morden. The walk starts in the village and follows the Icknield Way Path north east towards Upper Gatley End. Here you turn north to follow a public footpath to Steeple Morden, passing the windmill on the way. The route continues north to Guilden Morden before turning south west to link up with the Northfield Road country lane. Follow this south and it will take you back to Ashwell.",
