  "description": "This walk follows the Edith Cavell Pilgrimage route from Nurse Cavell\u2019s home village of Swardeston to Norwich Cathedral. Born in Swardeston in 1865, Edith Cavell was a heroine of the first world war. She went on to become a pioneer of professional nursing training in Brussels and she nursed soldiers from both sides during the war in occupied Belgium. This pleasant walking trail starts in Swardeston village and runs for just over 7 miles throught the countryside and the city of Norwich. Highlights on the route include the lovely Marston Marshes Nature Reserve and views of the River Yare Valley countryside.",
