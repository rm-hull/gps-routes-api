  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this pretty reservoir near Burnley. There are good footpaths taking you through the countryside and woodland which surround the reservoir. You can park at the southern end of the water and pick up the path which leads up into the lovely countryside above Clowbridge. The path then takes you to the woodland of Greenhill Clough before returning to the car park by following the track on the west side of the water. On the way there are fine views to Pendle Hill , Stony Hill, Nutshaw and Burnt Hill. You can extend your walk by picking up the Rossendale Way or the Burnley Way which run past the reservoir.",
