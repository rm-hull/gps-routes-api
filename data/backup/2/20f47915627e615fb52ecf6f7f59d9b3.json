  "description": "These woods on the outskirts of Plymouth have miles of good cycling and walking trails. For mountain bikers there's some good downhill trails and nice wide tracks for leisure riding. Features include twists, turns, jumps and some berms built up by local riders. See the video below for an idea of the sort of tracks you will find on the site. There's also a myriad of footpaths on which walkers can explore the 230 hectare (568 acre) site. Look out for pretty bluebells in the spring and a variety of wildlife including deer and various woodland birds. To extend your exercise head to the western end of the site and pick up the Plymbridge Woods Family Cycle Trail. The shared cycling and walking trail runs alongs the trackbed of a disused railway line with views of the River Plym. The West Devon Way long distance trail also runs past the woods. Pick up the trail and head north to visit the Bickleigh Vale and the village of Yelverton. Here you can enjoy a stroll around Yelverton Garden House or pick up the cycle trails around Burrator Reservoir .",
