  "description": "This walk climbs this small hill overlooking the village of Burrowbridge in the Somerset Levels. On top of the hill there is the striking 18th century ruined church of St Michael's. It's a short, steep climb to the hill summit from the car park but there are lovely views over the Somerset Levels towards Glastonbury Tor and the Rivers Parrett and Tone. This circular walk starts at the Burrow Mump car park and climbs to the ruined church before heading along the river to Samways Farm. Here you head into the countryside along the Burrow Drove and Broad Drove tracks. You continue to Pathe and Stathe where you pick up a trail along the river which leads back to Burrowbridge. There's lovely views across Southlake Moor which can be flooded in winter. This attracts large numbers of wildfowl including pochard, teal and tufted duck. Look out for Otters and newts along the River Parret. The River Parret Trail runs through Burrowbridge so you can extend your walk by picking up this waterside, long distance trail. If you head south east you will come to Langport while walking north east will take you into Bridgwater.",

It's nestled under the shadow of Burrow Mump and the place where King Alfred famously burnt the cakes when he was hiding from the invading Danes, hence the pub\u2019s name. It's a friendly place with great home cooked food. You can the find the pub next to the river at postcode TA7 0RB."

The abbey is run by English Heritage and has a fascinating history having once been a wealthy Benedictine house and the second oldest religious foundation in Somerset. It's another worthy local piece of history to investigate in the area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks page."
