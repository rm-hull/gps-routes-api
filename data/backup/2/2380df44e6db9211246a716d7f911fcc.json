    "description": "Visit these beautiful falls on this short walk from Callander in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. You can follow a cycling and walking trail along a dismantled railway line from Callander to the falls. It's about a 2.5 mile walk along the Garbh Uisge river and the forestry of Queen Elizabeth Forest Park . It's a splendid short route with the rushing waters of the river and views of Ben Ledi and the other surrounding mountains. You can extend your walk by continuing north and visiting Loch Lubnaig . Just to the west of Callander there's another nice trail running along Loch Venachar and Loch Drunkie .",
