  "description": "This Kent based village is located close to Tunbridge Wells , Matfield and Pembury . It's a good place to start a walk with lots of footpaths to follow through the surrounding countryside of the High Weald . This walk from the village takes you along a section of the High Weald Landscape Trail to neighbouring Goudhurst , via the Furnace Pond and Rectory Park. The village is considered historically significant as it was closely involved in post medieval iron making. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it south to the Furnace Pond, passing a number of orchards on the way. You continue south past Horsmonden, Sprivers Wood and Shirrenden Wood before passing through Rectory Park where there are more pretty ponds. You'll then pass Parsonage Wood and Lordship Wood before turning east to Small bridge and Goudhurst. Here you can enjoy refreshments at the local pub before heading back to Brenchley on the same paths.",
