    "description": "This large park sits in a fine spot on the North Downs near Caterham and Coulsdon. There's miles of footpaths with woodland, meadows, Nature trails and a trim trail to try. You can start the walk from the Happy Valley car park just to the west of Coulsdon Common in Old Coulsdon. From here you can pick up a section of the London Loop heading north west through the scenic valley. The site also includes Devilsden Wood and chalk grassland with interesting flora such as the rare man orchid and round-headed rampion. At the western end you can extend the walk on Farthing Downs where there's some fine walking and cycling trails with tremendous views over the North Downs. There's also a handily located 18th century pub to relax in after your exercise.",
