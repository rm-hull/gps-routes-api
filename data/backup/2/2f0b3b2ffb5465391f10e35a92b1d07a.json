It's a nice place for an afternoon stroll with good footpaths taking you to peaceful woodland, beautiful lakes, a gothick alcove, a Tuscan temple arbour and a folly mausoleum. Hestercombe is generally considered to be one of the finest gardens in England. The castle is located just north of Taunton where you can visit the old castle and pick up the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal and the Grand Western Canal. There's also something of a hidden gem to be found at the Trull Waterfall, just to the south of the town.",
