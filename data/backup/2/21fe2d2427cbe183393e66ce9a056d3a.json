  "description": "This walk visits Inch Island in Lough Swilly in County Donegal. The island is a great place for scenic walks and includes a wildlife rich nature reserve which is great for birdwatching. This walk on the island takes you along Inch Lake to the bird hide and the Western causeway. You can start off from the Inch Lake car park and picnic area on the south eastern part of the island. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south west along the water to the causeway. On the way you can enjoy lovely views over the surrounding countryside and look out for a variety of birds. Look out for species such as greenland white fronted goose, whooper swan and greylag goose. To continue your walking on the island you could try the 8 km looped walk in the the Inch Wildfowl Reserve. The site includes two car parks, seating, viewpoints and a number of bird hides open to the public.

      "content": "The island is located just west of Londonderry where you could try the historic Derry Walls. To the north there's the Mamore Gap to explore. There's a good cycling and walking trail taking you through the Gap with great views of the surrounding hills and the Inishowen Peninsula. Near here there's also Malin Head, the most northerly point of mainland Ireland. The scenic spot is also well known as a filming location for the Star Wars movies. Head east and you could pick up the Moville Shore Walk. This fine coastal walk takes you from Moville to Greencastle with glorious views across Lough Foyle to enjoy on the way."
