Green Lane turns off the B1149, leading east past North Farm and Green Lane Farm from where it turns into an unsurfaced track which traverses Lodge Hill Larch Plantation and Gravelpit Plantation passing Heath Farm. A surfaced road again in its easternmost section the lane connects with the A140 by Horsham St Faith."
