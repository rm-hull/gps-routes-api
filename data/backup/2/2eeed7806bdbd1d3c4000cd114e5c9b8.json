  "description": "Climb to the summit of this distinctive hill near Guisborough and enjoy wonderful views across the beautiful North York Moors National Park. The circular walk runs for a distance of about 2 miles but is still quite a challenging climb. The summit has a symbolic half-cone shape and jagged cliff, which has been likened to the Matterhorn in Switzerland. The area is managed by the National Trust so there are very good footpaths to take you to the summit. The walk starts at the car park just to the west of the hill, and heads along Roseberry Lane and through Newton Wood and Roseberry Common to the summit. There are wonderful views of the Cleveland plain and the Pennines on a clear day. From the summit you descend toward Newton Wood for another woodland section where you can see bluebells in the spring months. Also look out for roe deer and woodpeckers on this part of the walk. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Cleveland Way and head east to the Guisborough Forest and Walkway. You could also climb to Captain Cook's Monument for more wonderful views of the area. Another similar climb can be found at Eston, Middlesbrough. From Eston Nab there are more splendid views over the moors to the coast. You can follow the Cleveland Way through Hutton Lowcross Woods to reach the nab.",

      "content": "If you'd like to come by public transport then Great Ayton rail station is located about a mile south of the hill. You can follow public footpaths north from here to take you up to the summit on an alternative route. The station is on the Esk Valley Line which runs from Middlesbrough to Whitby. For a longer, more challenging route try our Cleveland Way Circular Walk from Great Ayton. This starts from the village and uses a section of the National Trail to take you to the hill and Captain Cook's Monument. Head a couple of miles north east into the town of Guisborough and you could pay a visit to Gisborough Priory. The Augustinian priory has a facinating history dating back to the 12th century. You can enjoy a stroll around the atmospheric ruins where there is a distinctive arch, which is a well-known landmark used as a symbol for Guisborough. The site is run by English Heritage and is free to explore. You can find it in the attracive market town at Priory Grounds, Church Street at postcode TS14 6HG. The Cleveland Street Walk can also be picked up here. To the south westthere's the fascinating ancient sites at the Lord Stones and the Wainstones. The climb to Carlton Bank near Carlton in Cleveland is also located in this area."
