    "description": "Climb to the summit of this distinctive hill near Guisborough and enjoy wonderful views across the beautiful North York Moors National Park. The circular walk runs for a distance of about 2 miles but is still quite a challenging climb. The summit has a symbolic half-cone shape and jagged cliff, which has been likened to the Matterhorn in Switzerland. The area is managed by the National Trust so there are very good footpaths to take you to the summit. The walk starts at the car park just to the west of the hill, and heads along Roseberry Lane and through Newton Wood and Roseberry Common to the summit. There are wonderful views of the Cleveland plain and the Pennines on a clear day. From the summit you descend toward Newton Wood for another woodland section where you can see bluebells in the spring months. Also look out for roe deer and woodpeckers on this part of the walk. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Cleveland Way and head east to the Guisborough Forest and Walkway . You could also climb to Captain Cook's Monument for more wonderful views of the area. Another similar climb can be found at Eston, Middlesbrough . From Eston Nab there are more splendid views over the moors to the coast. You can follow the Cleveland Way through Hutton Lowcross Woods to reach the nab.",
