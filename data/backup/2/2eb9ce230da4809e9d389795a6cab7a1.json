The bridge was destroyed for military reasons in 1915 by the armed forces, it is not known what the reasons were. The bridge was not replaced after the war. In 1959 following historical research by The Ramblers Association, a public inquiry established that the footpaths between Sefton and Lunt Village and Bells Lane Lydiate were public footpaths. The new Showrick Bridge was built by Sefton Council in partnership with Lancashire County Council in 1998 with grant support from the Countryside Commission and The Environment Agency."

    "description": "This walk visits the wildlife rich Lunt Meadows Nature Reserve on Merseyside. The large wetland area has some pleasant footpaths taking you to the River Alt and the village of Sefton. It's a fantastic place for bird watching with species such as heron, lapwings, redshank, dunlin and oystercatchers to look out for. In Sefton you can visit the old church and enjoy some post walk refreshments in the noteworthy local pub. To extend your waterside walking you could head a short distance east to Maghull where you can pick up the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal . The epic Trans Pennine Trail can also be picked up here.",
