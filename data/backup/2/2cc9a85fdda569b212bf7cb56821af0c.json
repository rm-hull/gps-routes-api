  "description": "This Hampshire based village is surrounded by beautiful countryside in all directions. There are lovely climbs to the Downs south of the village, while to the east there are woodland trails to try in Sandford Woods and Wolverton Common. The village also has an interesting history with many historic buildings and strong connections with horse racing. The Park House Stables has produced some famous racehorses over the years, with TV presenter and former jockey, Clare Balding now part of the team running the stables. This circular walk from the village climbs to one of the highlights of the area at Watership Down . The hill was made famous by Richard Adams' 1972 novel and the subsequent 1978 animated film. The route then goes on to explore Freemantle Down, just to the south of the village. The walk starts in the village centre and follows footpaths south west to climb to Watership Down. From this elevated position there are wonderful views over the surrounding countryside and the Sydmonton Court estate. The estate consists of a 16th century Tudor manor house and is home to the summer arts Sydmonton Festival. On the Down you can pick up the Wayfarer's Walk . This waymarked trail can be followed east to Canon Heath Down and Stubbington Down. Here you turn north east towards Freemantle Down and Cottington's Hill where there's the Hannington TV transmitter. The route then descends to the north to return to Kingsclere.",
