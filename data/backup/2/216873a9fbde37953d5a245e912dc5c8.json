At the back of the cottage, on the level of a public car park, is a doorway to a dungeon, once used as a lock-up. Nearby there is a pinfold, built to hold livestock, but now a picnic area"

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Hebdon Bridge to the nearby village of Heptonstall before exploring the area to the west of the settlements. The route uses sections of the Rochdale Canal , the Calderdale Way and the Pennine Way to create a circular walk through the woods and countryside. The walk starts at the train station in Hebden Bridge and follows the canal west through the town towards Hebble End. You then turn north to follow public footpaths north to Heptonstall passing Mytholm on the way. There's some interesting old buildings in the attractive village including the 16th century Stag Cottage and the ruined church which was founded in 1260. After exploring the village the route picks up the Calderdale Way and follows it through the woodland trails in Eaves Wood before heading west through the Colden Clough. The pretty Colden Water runs through this area with little waterfalls on the way. After about a mile or so you can then pick up the Pennine Way and follow it south towards Charlestown where you can pick up the canal again. Follow it east and it will take you back into Hebden Bridge, passing Calderside on the way.",
