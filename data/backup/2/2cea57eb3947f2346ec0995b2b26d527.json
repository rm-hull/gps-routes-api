  "description": "Explore 200 acres of beautiful gardens on this easy walk in the New Forest National Park. The gardens have miles of well laid out footpaths perfect for an afternoon stroll. In the gardens you'll find a wonderful collection of rhododendrons, azaleas, camellias, rare trees and plants. There are also tranquil lakes and ponds with pretty wooden bridges over the water. Other highlights include the Hydrangea Walk, the Rock Garden, Iris Garden, the Camellia Walk and a riverside path along the Beaulieu river. You can also catch the super Steam railway which will take you on a wonderful tour of the gardens. If you would like to extend your walking in the area you could pick up the Solent Way and enjoy a riverside walk along the Beaulieu River. On the opposite side to the gardens there's the delightful hamlet of Buckler's Hard where there's a number of pretty Georgian cottages running down to the river and a marina. Click on the google street view link below and you can virtually explore the gardens.",

Also to the east you can pick up the Ashlett Creek to Calshot Walk. This will take you from Ashlett Quay along the creek to the site. There's great views across Southampton Water and lots of birdlife to look out for in the reserve. The castle and sea wall are also well worth exploring. The artillery fort has an interesting history having been constructed by Henry VIII on the Calshot Spit during the 16th century. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks, New Forest Walks page."
