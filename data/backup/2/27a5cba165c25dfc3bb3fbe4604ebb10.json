  "description": "The town of Leatherhead is in a good position for walking, situated on the edge of the North Downs and Surrey Hills AONB. There's nice riverside trails along the River Mole and miles of woodland footpaths in the nearby Box Hill and Norbury Parks to the south. This walk from the town takes you along a section of the Mole Gap Trail to Box Hill Country Park. The walk starts from the train station where you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it south along the River Mole. The trail passes Fairfield, Fetcham Grove, Thorncroft and Norbury Park Farm before coming to Westhumble where there is a ruined 12th century chapel and characterful train station. The trail then heads south east into Box Hill park, climbing to the viewpoint at the southern edge. Follow the woodland trails east through Oak Wood and you will come to Box Hill village. The trail heads north here, skirting the edge of Headley Heath before turning west across Mickleham Downs. Around Norbury Park Farm you rejoin with the river trail and follow it north back to Leatherhead station.",
