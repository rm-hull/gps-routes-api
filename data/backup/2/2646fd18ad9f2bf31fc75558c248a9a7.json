Around 1850, during the peak of agriculture, Westwood boasted six operational mills\u2014five corn mills and one whiting mill. Originally, the exterior of the Black Mill was whitewashed, but it was later tarred, leading to its new nickname. Unfortunately, a fire in 1868 caused damage, leading to the dismantling of all the timber parts and working gear. Although the mill served as a dwelling until 1934, it now stands as a monument and a local landmark. An exhibition by East Ridings Museums on the Westwood highlights the site's significance in the hearts of local cricketers during the 19th century."

It was a brick tower mill with five sails. The mill was dismantled in 1891 and today only the lower part of the tower remains. In this photograph, it is hidden from view by the private house far left, still known as Lowson's Mill. The white-painted buildings, originally part of the same close, are today semi-detached houses, being Westwood Mill and Westwood Mill Cottage respectively."

      "content": "Beverley boasts four pastures situated in various directions from the town. Along the river Hull, Figham and Swinemoor pastures are located to the east and southeast, while Westwood and Hurn form a large pasture to the east and southeast of the town. The chalk extracted from these pastures played a vital role in constructing the foundations of Beverley's streets and producing lime. Until 1812, the Corporation derived a consistent income from leasing out lime kilns on the Westwood. Local brick makers utilised clay from the area for brick production, with Beverley-made bricks used in notable structures like the North Bar in Beverley. Evidence of this historical industry can still be observed in the numerous hollows and pits that characterize the pasture. The Westwood hosts both a challenging golf course popular with visitors and a racecourse that attracts increasing interest, featuring various events and festivals throughout the year. The oversight of the pastures falls under the responsibility of the Pasture Masters, a group of elected individuals from the Freemen of Beverley each March. While the Pasture Act of 1836 clarified the Pasture Masters' authority to administer and enforce bylaws, it did not explicitly state the land's ownership. In 1978, the courts determined that the pastures were owned by the then Borough Council, and it is currently \"owned\" by the East Riding of Yorkshire Council."
