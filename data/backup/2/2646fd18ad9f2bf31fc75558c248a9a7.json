      "caption": "Black Mill. The Black Mill holds a captivating history of its own.\nAround 1850, during the peak of agriculture, Westwood boasted six operational mills\u2014five corn mills and one whiting mill. Originally, the exterior of the Black Mill was whitewashed, but it was later tarred, leading to its new nickname. Unfortunately, a fire in 1868 caused damage, leading to the dismantling of all the timber parts and working gear.\nAlthough the mill served as a dwelling until 1934, it now stands as a monument and a local landmark. An exhibition by East Ridings Museums on the Westwood highlights the site's significance in the hearts of local cricketers during the 19th century."

It was a brick tower mill with five sails. The mill was dismantled in 1891 and today only the lower part of the tower remains. In this photograph, it is hidden from view by the private house far left, still known as Lowson's Mill. The white-painted buildings, originally part of the same close, are today semi-detached houses, being Westwood Mill and Westwood Mill Cottage respectively."

  "description": "This walk explores a lovely area of common land in Beverley in East Riding of Yorkshire. The wide area of pasture includes some fine trails with countryside views and cows roaming freely through the area. You'll find Beverley Westwood on the western side of the town. The Cinder Path can be picked up just off York Road near the pretty Coronation Gardens which are also well worth a visit. Follow the path west and it will take you onto the common where you can enjoy fine views of the historic Black Mill (more information below). There are also views back to the famous Beverley Minster, St Mary's Church and the adjacent Beverley Racecourse to enjoy. The Beverley Twenty long distance footpath crosses the common. You could extend your walk by following the trail west through the countryside to visit the nearby village of Walkington .",
