  "description": "This circular walk explores the old Neidpath Railway in Peebles, in the Scottish Borders. On the way you will also visit the viaduct and the Neidpath Tunnel, which you can walk right through. The walk starts in Peebles town centre and then picks up a footpath heading west along the River Tweed to the pretty Hay Lodge Park. You'll pass the historic Neidpath Castle before coming to the viaduct. You can cross the river here and enjoy some fine views over the area from the elevated position. The route then enters the tunnel where you advised to bring a flashlight or torch so you can safely walk through to the other side. After exiting the tunnel you continue along the river before passing the weir and crossing Peebles Bridge to return to the town. To continue your railway walking in the area, head to the eastern side of town to pick up the Tweed Valley Railway Path. This will take you to Innerleithen along a pleasant shared cycling and walking trail. You can also access the excellent mountain bike trails and waymarked walks in the expansive Glentress Forest from the route.",
