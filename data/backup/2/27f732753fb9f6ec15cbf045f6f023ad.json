  "description": "Follow the woodland trails through the delightful forest on this circular walk in Alcester. The woods are located just to the south of Alcester . You can easily reach them from the town by following the Arden Way over the River Arrow and past Oversley Green. There's also a car park in the north eastern corner just off the A46. This will give you access to miles of good woodland trails. It's great in the spring and summer with lots of bluebells and wildflowers to enjoy. Look out for butterflies, badgers and lots of birdlife as you make your way through the woods. To extend your walk you can continue along the Arden Way towards Upton and Walcote.",
