  "description": "This walk visits the\u00a0medieval Portchester Castle and the Roman Fort of Portus Adurni near Fareham in Hampshire. The walk then continues along the Porchester coast towards Fareham with lovely views of Portsmouth Harbour on the way. The walk starts from the car park next to the castle. The Grade I listed building was probably founded in the late 11th\u00a0century and taken under royal control in 1154.\u00a0 Occupying a commanding position at the head of\u00a0Portsmouth Harbour, in the medieval period Portchester was an important port. After exploring the castle the route heads west along the Allan King's Way , passing the Kenwood, Alton Grove and Harbour View Open Spaces. The route continues past Wicor Hard, Fareham Lake and Cams Bay where the path bends around the Cam Hall Estate and golf course. The final section runs along the opposite side of Fareham's pretty quays. To continue your walking in the area try our Fareham Walk which uses more of the Allan King's Way footpath to visit the Nelson Monument and Fort Nelson. The fort is one of five defensive\u00a0forts\u00a0built on the summit of Portsdown Hill in the 1860s, overlooking the important naval base of\u00a0Portsmouth.",
