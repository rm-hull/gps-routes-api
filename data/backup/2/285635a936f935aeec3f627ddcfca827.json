  "description": "This circular walk from the village of Selworthy climbs to Selworthy Beacon before visiting Bossington Hill , the lovely coastline at Hurlstone Point and the splendid pack horse bridge at the village of Allerford. The walk starts in the village of Selworthy where there is a car park and visitor centre. From here you can follow footpaths north west to Selworthy Combe, Bury Castle and the Memorial Hut. Here you turn east to climb to the 308 metre high Selworthy Beacon and enjoy some excellent views over the area. At the beacon you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it north west to another fine viewpoint at Bossington Hill. Look out for wildlife including buzzards, peregrine falcons, kestrels as you make your way across the hill. The route then descends to the coast at Hurlstone Point. There's some splendid steep cliffs here and great views over Porlock Bay and Selworthy Sand beach below. The route then turns south to visit the woodland area around West Lynch before paying a visit to Allerford. The village has a very photogenic 15th century bridge over the Aller Brook and a number of picturesque cottages. From Allerford you continue south east past Brandish Street before returning to the village.",
