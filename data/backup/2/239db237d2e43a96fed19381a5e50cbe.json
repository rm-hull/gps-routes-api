The forest is criss crossed with miles of good walking and cycling trails and a fine place to extend your outing. It's also great for wildlife spotting with the resident red squirrels of particular note. The Ventnor to Steephill Cove Walk uses a section of the trail in the Ventnor area. It takes you to a popular little cove with kiosks, self catering cottages and a beach. The circular walk also visits the splendid Ventnor Botanical Gardens where you can enjoy a variety of Mediterranean plants and flowers.
