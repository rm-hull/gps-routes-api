  "description": "Visit these two landmarks associated with the Bronte sisters on this delightful literary walk in West Yorkshire. The two sites can be reached from Haworth which is just a few miles east of the falls. The area known as Bronte Country is exceptionally beautiful with flowing becks, attractive moorland scenery and great views of the Pennine Hills. It is quite a challenging walk climbing to a height of over 1300ft on the high points. The walk starts from the town of Haworth at the church in the centre of the town. There is a parking area close by and the train station is also just a few minutes stroll away. From the church you can pick up the Bronte Way to to take you through Penistone Hill Country Park. The 179 acre park consists of lovely undulating grass and heather moorland with fabulous views over the area. The path then continues across Haworth Moor to the falls. The picturesque spot was a favourite of the sisters, who would often spend time contemplating at the falls. After enjoying the beautiful spot the walk continues south west to the ruined farmhouse of Top Withens, said to have been the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. The route then follows a section of the Pennine Way over Stanbury Moor, passing Withins Slack and Flaight Hill before rejoining the Bronte Way. On the return leg you can take a small detour to visit Lower Laithe Reservoir if you have time. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the Pennine Way and visit Watersheddles Reservoir and Ponden Reservoir which is located just north of the falls. Here you will find Ponden Hall said to be the inspiration for Thrushcross Grange, the home of the Linton family in Wuthering Heights.",

The riverside mill is in a great location and has a good selection of cakes to try. You can find it on Ponden Lane at postcode BD22 0HP for your sat navs. After your meal you could then enjoy a stroll around the adjacent Ponden Reservoir.Just up the road from here is the Old Silent Inn which does great food and also provides accommodation. You can find it on Hob Lane at postcode BD22 0HW. Also in Stanbury is the aptly named Wuthering Heights. This pub has a fine beer garden with great views over the surrounding countryside. It's on the Main Street in the village at postcode BD22 0HB."
