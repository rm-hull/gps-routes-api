The helmsman of the narrowboat has to make a hard left turn and hope that there is nothing coming the other way through the bridge."

Worsley Delph is the start of 46 miles of tunnels that lead to a network of underground mines. Nestling up against the openings to these tunnels are the outlines of mining boats that would have gone in and out, first empty and then full of the coal they collected. They give a hint at what it would have looked like over a quarter of a century ago as day to day life was carried out in the Delph."

  "description": "This circular walk around Worsley uses a series of public footpaths to explore these pretty woods in Salford. There's shady trails, streams, a lake, sculptures and a wild flower trail to enjoy. You can start the walk from the car park off Greenleach Lane at the northern end of the woods. From here you can pick up the trails heading south along the Kempnough Brook to the Old Warke Dam. Then follow paths along the lake to the Worsley Canal Basin before picking up other footpaths to take you back to the car park. The Bridgewater Canal runs past the southern and western end of the woods so you can easily pick up the towpath to extend your walk. Heading west will take you toward Astley while heading south will take you toward Patricroft and Trafford Park. See our Worsley Canal Walk for more details. Just to the north east you will find Clifton Country Park abd Prestwich Forest Park where there are more good walking and cycling trails to try.",
