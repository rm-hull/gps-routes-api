  "description": "Enjoy lovely coastal views and a variety of wading birds in this nature reserve in Christchurch. It's a delightful area with lagoons, marshland, reed beds and splendid views back to Christchurch Harbour and Priory. It's great for wildlife with over 300 birds spotted at the site. Look out for Curlew, Little Egret, Black-tailed Godwits and Herons. Also keep an eye out for rabbits and the resident horses and their foals. You can park at the Stanpit Recreation Ground car park and then pick up the walking trails through the reserve. National Cycle Network Route 2 runs from Christchurch to the reserve on a nice traffic free path too. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Stour Valley Way or the Avon Valley Path which run through Christchurch. Also nearby is the splendid Mudeford Quay and Hengistbury Head where you can enjoy coastal views towards the Purbeck Hills and the Isle of Wight. To reach Hengistbury Head you can walk east to Mudeford Quay and catch the ferry to Mudeford. The Bournemouth Coast Path also runs past the reserve so you can pick this up and head along the coast to Highcliffe Castle and Coast too.",
