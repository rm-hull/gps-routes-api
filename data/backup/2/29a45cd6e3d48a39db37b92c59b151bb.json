  "description": "This route follows a section of the Esk Valley Walk from Grosmont to Whitby on the North Yorkshire coast. The walk runs for a distance of just over 7 miles on an undulating, waymarked footpath. It starts and ends at train stations so you can catch the train back at the end of the route. Along the way there are nice views of the River Esk and the countryside of the lovely Esk Dale. The walk starts from Grosmont Station and heads north west along a country lane to Priory Lane. Here you can pick up the Esk Valley Walk and follow it north east through Dorsley Bank Wood and Hecks Wood to Sleights. Here you pass a weir and cross the river before continuing onto Ruswarp. There's another station here on the Esk Valley Railway where you can look out for the classic old steam trains that run through the valley. The final section bends round to the north before finishing in Whitby at the train station. To extend the walk continue through the town and visit the historic ruins of Whitby Abbey. Or you could head west and visit Whitby Sands.",
