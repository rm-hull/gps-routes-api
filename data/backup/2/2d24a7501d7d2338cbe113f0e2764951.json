    "description": "This beautiful coastal heathland is a wonderful place for a peaceful circular walk. The area is owned by the National Trust and is covered in miles of good footpaths taking you through the pretty purple heathland. It's great for birdwatching with Dartford warbler, nightjar and woodlark regular visitors to the area. Also look out for red deer and muntjac deer. After exploring the heathland you can enjoy a stroll along the lovely Dunwich beach and take in the coastal views. There are very good facilities with a National Trust tea room, shop and car park. It's easy to extend your walk in this lovely area. The Suffolk Coast Path runs through the heath so you can pick this up and head north to Dunwich Forest . Here you will find miles of peaceful woodland walking trails and lovely conservation areas of marshland and wetland. Look out for Dunwich ponies and a variety of other wildlife in the woods. Just to the south you will find Minsmere Nature Reserve . The reserve consists of woodland, reed bed, lowland heath, wet grassland and shingle vegetation. It attracts many different birds such as Avocet, Bittern and Marsh Harriers. You can virtually explore the heath using the google street view link below!",
