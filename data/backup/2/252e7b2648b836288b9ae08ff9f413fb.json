    "description": "Explore 130 acres of gardens and castle terraces on this walk near Penrith in the Lake District. The walk takes you around the dramatic ruins of the 1806 Gothic castle and then on to the Lakeland Bird of Prey Centre, situated in the walled garden of Lowther Castle. Here you can see over 150 falcons, hawks, eagles, buzzards and owls from the UK and abroad. Other highlights in the grounds include sweeping lawns, Jack Croft's pond, beautiful Summer Houses and an escarpment with fabulous views of the Lake District's hills and mountains. The castle, gardens and stable courtyard have been redeveloped since 2011 using \u00a38.9m of funds secured from the North West development Agency and European Regional Development Fund. It has now been turned into a major visitor attraction with cafe, shop and a display area where visitors can find out more about the process of restoration. If you have time you could also visit the adjacent Askham Hall gardens with colourful terraces, a 230ft long double herbaceous border, formal lawns, kitchen gardens, woodland, meadows and ponds. The River Lowther also runs past the grounds so there is the option of following the riverside path towards Yanwath Wood or Helton. The climb to Askham Fell can also be started from the village.",
