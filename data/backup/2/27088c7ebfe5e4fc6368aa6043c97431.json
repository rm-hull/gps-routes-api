Up until the 7th century A.D. the village of Goodmanham was home to the high shrine of Northumbria - a great temple of Woden, father of the gods. Upon the conversion of King Edwin of Northumbria to the Christian faith in 627 A.D. the temple was destroyed by the high priest Coifi, an event which is related by St. Bede in his History of the English Speaking Peoples (Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum). The sacking of the temple is also pictured in a stained glass window in the 12th century Norman church."

  "description": "A circular walk from the Wolds settlement of Goodmanham exploring the countryside to the east of the village. The route uses sections of the waymarked Yorkshire Wolds Way and Hudson Way which run through the area. You'll visit attractive wolds and dales with a visit to a chalk pit nature reserve as well. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Yorkshire Wolds Way. Follow the waymarked trail south east and it will take you over the Mill Beck and towards the Arras Cottages. Here you leave the trail to pick up Kiplingcotes Lane and follow it north to Goodmanham Dale and Ridge Hill. The route then turns west to follow a trail through Goodmanham Wold to the Kiplingcotes Chalk Pit which is now a nature reserve. This section passes along the Hudson Way, a shared cycling and walking footpath running along a disused railway line. From the chalk pit you continue west along country lanes to return you to the village.",
