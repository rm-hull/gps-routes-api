  "description": "This 30 mile circular walk explores the River Tame Valley around Greater Manchester. The route visits a number of local highlights including several reservoirs, country parks and fine viewpoints. The route begins at the train station in Broadbottom. You can pick up the trail just to the south of the station and follow it west to Idle Hill and the splendid viewpoint at Werneth Low Country Park. The next stage continues west to Haughton Green where you can enjoy the bluebell woodland and wildlife in Haughton Dale Nature Reserve. Around here you cross the Peak Forest Canal before a waterside walk along the River Tame takes you to Reddish Vale Country Park. You continue north to Debdale Park where you can enjoy pleasant waterside trails around Gorton Reservoir and the nearby Audenshaw Reservoir. The route then heads through Droylsden to Clayton Vale and the Medlock Valley where there are views of the River Medlock and some popular cycling trails. Follow the river north east and it will take you to Daisy Nook Country Park where you can enjoy a canal, woodlands and wildflower meadows. There's also a nice riverside cafe where you can enjoy a pit stop. The path continues east to Hartshead Pike and Mossley where you cross the moors to visit the remote and picturesque Swineshaw Reservoir and Arnfield Reservoir. The final section runs south past Hollingworth and Hadfield with a run along the Etherow Goyt Valley Way taking you back towards Broadbottom.",
