  "description": "The town of Orpington is located at the south-eastern edge of Greater London. There's lots of good walking opportunities with open countryside and the North Downs to the south of the town. Several waymarked walking trails also run through or past the town, taking you to parks, gardens and woodland. This walk around Orpington uses part of the London Loop and the Cudham Circular Walk to explore the countryside, parks and woods to the south of the town. The walk starts on the western side of the town where you can pick up the London Loop long distance footpath. Follow it south past Farnborough and it will take you to High Elms Country Park . The 250 acre park is one of the highlights of the area with woodlands, a nature centre, ice well, formal gardens and wildflower meadows to see. From the park the route continues south through Cuckoo Wood and Hazelwood before coming to the little village of Cudham. You continue west through Single Street before turning north to Luxted and Downe . Here you will pass Downe House the former home of Charles Darwin. From Downe you follow footpaths heading north east past Farthing Street where you pick up the London Loop again. It will take you back through High Elms Park before returning you to Orpington.",
