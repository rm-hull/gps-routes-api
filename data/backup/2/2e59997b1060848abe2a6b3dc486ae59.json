  "description": "This circular walk visits the Carn Marth outdoor theatre and the surrounding quarries in the Redruth area of Cornwall. The walk starts just north of Pennance where you can pick up footpaths taking you around the interesting theatre to the Carn Marth Hill summit which stands at 235 metres. Here you'll find a trig point and a picturesque quarry lake. There's also an outdoor Amphitheatre where you can enjoy performances during the warmer months. From the elevated spot there are also some fine views over the area to nearby Portreath, St Agnes Beacon, Falmouth and the coast. The site includes plenty of interesting flora with Lowland Heath, Gorse, Bracken and a generous mixture of wildflowers during the summer.",
