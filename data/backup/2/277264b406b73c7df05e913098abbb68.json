  "description": "Follow the footpaths around Underbank Reservoir on this pleasant walk in the Peak District. It's about a 3 mile walk around the lake with a nice quiet footpath on the southern side and a roadside path on the northern side. The walk starts from the parking area on the southern side of the water, just off Oaks Lane. It's located just to the west of the town of Stocksbridge, in the City of Sheffield. From here you can pick up the trails heading past woodland to the Little Don River at the western end. You then head along the north side, passing Sheephouse Wood. At the eastern end you will pass along the impressive Dam wall with more views of the river. To extend the walk pick up the Barnsley Boundary Walk and head west to the nearby Langsett Reservoir. Here you'll find a popular circular walk through the woodland and open moorland around the reservoir.",
