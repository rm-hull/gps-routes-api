  "description": "An easy circular walk along the lower reaches of the Kinder Plateau, exploring the Vale of Edale. There's great views of several of the surrounding hills including Kinder Scout, Mam Tor and Lose Hill. In the summer months you'll see purple heather on the moors. The walk starts from Edale train station and heads north to Grindsbrook Booth. Here you'll find the Moorland Centre and the start of the Pennine Way. Follow the trail west to Broadlee-Bank Tor and Upper Booth. Here you turn left and descend to Barber Booth where there's some lovely views of the River Noe. The route then runs along the train line to Edale, passing Hay Meadows with lots of pretty wildflowers and a variety of butterflies to look out for. To continue your walking in the area you could continue west from Upper Booth to the challenging stone steps of Jacob's Ladder. There's also the nearby Kinder Reservoir and the highest falls in the Peak District at Kinder Downfall. You can also try our Kinder Scout From Edale Walk .",
