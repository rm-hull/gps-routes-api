  "description": "This famous cathedral city is located in a great spot for walkers close to the edge of both the Cotswolds and the Malvern Hills Walks. In the city itself there's nice waterside trails along the canal and river which skirt the city's eastern edge. There's also a local country park with woodland trails and an excellent viewpoint over the city. This circular walk takes you to some of the highlights of the city, visiting the cathedral, the docks, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal and the River Severn. The walk starts at the 11th century Gloucester Cathedral, just to the west of the train station. From the cathedral you head south to the Docks and the Main Basin on the canal. The docks are home to the National Waterways Museum where you can learn about the fascinating 200-year history of the docks and the Gloucester & Sharpness Canal. The docks are the most inland port in the country and include old dock buildings, designer shops and cafes. From the docks you can then follow the towpath south past High Orchard, St Pauls, Monk Meadow Dock and Hempsted Bridge. You then leave the canal to link up with the Severn Way and follow the riverside path back into the town centre.",
