  "description": "These pretty woods near Daventry have miles of good woodland trails to try. The woods are located just to the south of the village of Badby and are famous for carpets of bluebells in the spring months. You could follow the waymarked Knightley Way to the western edge of the woods and then pick up the trails. The village of Badby is also very pretty with picturesque stone and thatch cottages, village greens and a 14th century church. You can extend your walk by continuing south along the Knightley Way to the lovely Fawsley Hall and Park. Here you will find several pretty lakes, an isolated church and an Elizabethan house. The Nene Way also runs through the village. You could follow the path east along the River Nene to Newnham. If you head west from Badby you will soon come to Arbury Hill, the joint highest point of Northamptonshire. Just to the north east you will find Borough Hill in nearby Daventry.",
