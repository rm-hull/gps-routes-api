  "description": "This super country park in Milngavie has miles of footpaths and cycle routes to enjoy.  This route takes you alongside Mugdock Reservoir, through Mugdock Wood, along Allander Water and past Mugdock Loch before returning to the start point at the car park by the reservoir. The combination of peaceful woodland trails and waterside paths makes for a lovely cycle or walk. The park also includes the remains of the 14th-century Mugdock Castle and the ruins of the 19th century Craigend Castle, a Gothic Revival mansion. To extend the walk you can follow the waterside footpaths around the Milngavie Reservoirs on the eastern side of the park. It will take you around the Craigmaddie and Mugdock reservoirs with lovely views and woodland trails to enjoy. Glasgow is only about 6 miles south of the park so if you are coming from the city, one option is to follow the Kelvin Walkway to Mugdock.  The West Highland Way also runs through the park so you could continue your cycle/walk along this trail if you have time. Mugdock Country Park has excellent facilities with a visitor centre, shop and a garden centre located within the walled garden.",
