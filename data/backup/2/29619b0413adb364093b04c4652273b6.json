  "description": "This super country park in Milngavie has miles of footpaths and cycle routes to enjoy. This route takes you alongside Mugdock Reservoir, through Mugdock Wood, along Allander Water and past Mugdock Loch before returning to the start point at the car park by the reservoir. The combination of peaceful woodland trails and waterside paths makes for a lovely cycle or walk. The park also includes the remains of the 14th-century Mugdock Castle and the ruins of the 19th century Craigend Castle, a Gothic Revival mansion. To extend the walk you can follow the waterside footpaths around the Milngavie Reservoirs on the eastern side of the park. It will take you around the Craigmaddie and Mugdock reservoirs with lovely views and woodland trails to enjoy. Glasgow is only about 6 miles south of the park so if you are coming from the city, one option is to follow the Kelvin Walkway to Mugdock. The West Highland Way also runs through the park so you could continue your cycle/walk along this trail if you have time. Mugdock Country Park has excellent facilities with a visitor centre, shop and a garden centre located within the walled garden.",

      "content": "If you cross the road from the car park and head a short distance north you can visit Dumbrock Loch. The small loch is popular with wild swimmers. Around the loch there are also other footpaths taking you to the adjacent Dumbrock Muir where you can see Highland cattle roaming around. Just to the south there's more waterside trails along the tranquil Bardowie Loch. To the north, in Strathblane you can pick up the Strathkelvin Railway Path. This shared cycling and walking trail will take you towards Gartcosh via Kirkintilloch, with fine views of the Campsie Fells. Just to the north east of the park there's the pretty Loch Ardinning to visit. The loch is owned by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and is a great place for easy walks and wildlife spotting. To the north west there's the Burncrooks Reservoir Walk which visits the unusual narrow rocky chasm at the Whangie before heading to the pretty reservoir. Near here there's also something of a hidden gem at the Devil's Pulpit in Finnich Glen. There's a wonderful deep sandstone gorge and rushing waterfall to see in this geologically fascinating area. The epic West Highland Way starts in Milngavie. You could pick up the waymarked trail and follow it north to Craigallian Loch and Carbeth Loch on the Milngavie to Drymen Walk."
