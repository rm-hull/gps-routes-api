      "content": "Queens Head - The village inn dates back to the 17th century, and is constructed from local limestone. It features a spacious, beamed main bar complete with an open fire and a flagstone serving area that boasts a stone counter. The inn houses two dining areas, divided by a genuine fireplace and chimney breast. The menu is quite diverse, including steaks prepared in a Spanish charcoal oven. There's also a function room located towards the back. The rear of the inn opens up to an appealing garden, and boat moorings are available on the River Nene. Additionally, it offers nine en-suite bedrooms, designed in a courtyard style. You can find them at postcode PE8 6QB for your sat navs."

      "content": "The name of the village translates to 'Promontory place farm/settlement'. Tracing its origins back to the Anglo-Saxon era, the village once housed an Anglo-Saxon hall that was later acquired by the Viking king, Cnut the Great, and used as one of his royal residences. Post-1017, King Cnut, along with his court including Aethelric, the bishop of Dorchester on Thames, is known to have visited this hall. In 1107, Henry I granted the hall and its lands to Robert Bloet, the Bishop of Lincoln, to establish a prebend. This village and its manor gained wider recognition through their feature in episode 117, titled \"King Cnut's Manor,\" of the television show \"Time Team,\" which aired on 7 March 2004. While the manor has since become a private residence, the Prebendal Manor and Tithe Barn Museum, along with its gardens, are accessible to the public for a fee on select days. Notably, the gardens exclusively showcase plants that were introduced before 1485. Just to the south east is Elton where you can visit another local historic highlight at Elton Hall. The part Gothic house, is surrounded by beautiful parkland and gardens. The hall is open to the public during the summer months and a lovely place for a stroll."
