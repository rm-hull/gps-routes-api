    "description": "A 20 mile circular cycle and walking route through open countryside in north Buckinghamshire. It passes through a nature reserve and wildfowl centre on its way to a tour of the Saxon manors of Hanslope.\nThe open countryside of the Ouse and Tove Valleys gives extensive views across North Buckinghamshire and into Northants, with the distinctive spire of Hanslope Church the central feature. \nThe route is open to horseriders, pedal cyclists and walkers and uses a combination of metalled and unmetalled roads and tracks, and headland and crossfield bridleways. There are a number of gates to open and close and the bridleways can be muddy, particularly after wet weather.\nThe route is waymarked at every gate or major change in direction with a waymark disc - Circular Ride. Highlights on the route include the lovely Linford Lakes Nature Reserve where there are great wildlife spotting opportunities. You'll also pass the historic village of Great Linford where there's a fine manor house and several 17th century cottages to see.",
