  "description": "Enjoy a nice lakeside trail around Mercers Lake on this short walk in Redhill. There's a nice surfaced trail running round the water for just over a mile. Just to the west of the lake there's also two smaller lakes at Holmethorpe Lagoons, part of the Nutfield Marsh Nature Reserve. The reserve is a great place for wildlife watching with tufted duck, gadwall, little grebes, coot, moorhens and greylag geese to look out for on the water. There's also lots of pretty wildflowers such as meadows cowslip and trefoil, oxeye daisy and yarrow. You should see several varieties of butterfly fluttering around the flowers in the summer months. The walk starts from the Mercers Country Park car park off Nutfield Marsh Road. You then head west along the lake to Holmethorpe Lagoons, passing the Watercolour Estate. The route continues along the northern side of Mercers Lake to Spynes Mere Nature Reserve. There's three more lakes here with nice footpaths to follow around the wetland habitat. The route then returns to the car park and finish point of the walk. The site also includes a watersports centre and a cafe for refreshments after your exercise. The park is located only a couple of miles from Redhill and Earlswood Common. The commons have miles of good footpaths taking you to ponds, lakes, woodland and grassland with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Just to the north you can pick up the North Downs Way in Merstham. Our London to Brighton Cycle Route passes through the park. A traffic free section runs from the park to nearby Redhill.",

      "content": "The circular walk from neighbouring Bletchingley visits the park. It also visits the Moors Nature Reserve, Redhill and Earlswood Common and Earlswood Lakes. Bletchingley is also worth exploring with a conservation area including several historic medieval properties. The Tandridge Border Path starts from the lake car park. The long distance circular walk explores the Tandridge District on a waymarked footpath."
