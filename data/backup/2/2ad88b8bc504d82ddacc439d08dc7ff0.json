  "description": "This walk visits Talla Reservoir and waterfall in the Scottish Borders near Biggar. The walk starts from the roadside parking just east of the falls and the lake. Head west along the lane from here and you cross the bridge over Talla Water before coming to the waterfall. Continue along the lane and Talla Water and you will soon come to the lake. On the eastern side of the reservoir there's a nice flat country lane suitable for walkers and cyclists. It runs right along the lake with nice views across the waters to the hills rising up on the opposite side. It's easy to continue your waterside walking in the area by heading east to visit St Mary's Loch and Megget Reservoir . Camps Reservoir and Fruid Reservoir lie just to the west. For more information on the construction and history of the site see the informative wikipedia page.",
