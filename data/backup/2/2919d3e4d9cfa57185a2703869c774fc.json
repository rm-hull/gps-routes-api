  "description": "This walk visits Brombil Reservoir and Brombil Woods near Port Talbot . You can access a footpath just to the west of the water in Margam, where there is some car parking available. Follow the footpaths east through the woods to the small reservoir. It's a pretty spot with the little streams leading to the photogenic turquoise coloured reservoir. There's also the option of climbing into the surrounding foothills where you can enjoy some fine views towards the coast. You can extend the walk by heading south east to visit Margam Country Park where there's more lakes and a deer park.",
