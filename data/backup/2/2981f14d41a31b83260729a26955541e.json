Established in 1361 the inn has an amazing history and is famous for its medieval open fire place with a dog wheel. You can find it on West Street at postcode SN15 2LH. In the village of Cherhill, near the White Horse, you will find the Black Horse. The pub has an interesting history dating back to the 18th century when it was a coaching inn. It is notable for being the hideout for the infamous Cherhill Gang, a group of highwaymen that would rob passers by naked to avoid being caught. They have a charming interior with interesting artwork on the walls. There's also a good menu and an outdoor area as well. You can find them at a postcode of SN11 8UT for your sat navs. The village is also worth exploring with a number of picturesque thatched cottages and an old church to see."
