  "description": "This walk visits these three pretty reservoirs near Barnsley. The route makes use of the Penistone Boundary Walk and the Barnsley Boundary Walk to cross Royd Moor and visit each of the reservoirs in turn. It's a lovely area with the reservoirs surrounded by attractive countryside and views to the surrounding Yorkshire hills. The walk starts from the car park at Scout Dike Reservoir, just off the A629. The trail then runs along the western side of the water to Royd Moor before heading north to Ingbirchworth Moor and the final reservoir. To extend your walk you can continue along the Barnsley Boundary Walk to the smaller Broadstone Reservoir . It's located about half a mile west of Ingbirchworth Reservoir. The trail eventually reaches Holmfirth , passing Scholes on the way. Heading north east along the trail would take you to Gadding Moor and Cannon Hall Country Park .",
