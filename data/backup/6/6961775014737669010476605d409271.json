  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of the Fife Coastal Path from Dalgety Bay to Aberdour. It's about a 4 mile walk along steadily rising trail which is also suitable for cyclists. The walk starts at Donibristle Bay in Dalgety Bay. From here you can follow the waymarked path north east along the Bay to the ruins of the ancient St Bridget's Church which dates back to the 12th century. You then continue past Barnhill Bay to Aberdour where you can visit the historic castle. To extend the walk pick up the Aberdour to Burntisland Coastal Path and enjoy fine views of the Forth of Leith and the city of Edinburgh. Near the western end of the route you can enjoy views of the Forth Road Bridge which spans the Firth of Forth. There is a walkway/cycleway running across the bridge if you would like to cross over to South Queensferry.",
