  "description": "This epic circular walk explores the beautiful Dingle peninsula in County Kerry. The trail runs for 162-kilometres (101-miles) and is classified as one of Ireland's National Waymarked Trails. On the way you can enjoy spectacular cliff tops, lovely beaches, lakes, mountains and fine views over the Atlantic Ocean. The route starts and finishes in Tralee with a challenging climb to the Slieve Mish mountains and a visit to Dingle Bay early highlights. You'll then pass Annascaul where a detour to the remote Annascaul Lake is a worthy option. Near here there's also Slea Head and the coastal village of Ballydavid where you can try the popular Ballydavid Cliff Walk. The next highlight is the town of Dingle itself which is well worth exploring. Other highlights include reaching the extreme western point of Ireland where you can catch a ferry out to Blasket Island. On the return to Tralee you will pass Brandon, Kerry's holy mountain and the 8th\u2013highest peak in Ireland.",

To the south of Tralee there's the wonderful Killarney National Park where you could visit narrow mountain pass at the Gap of Dunloe or enjoy more waterside walking at Mucross Lake, Lough Guitane and the Torc Waterfall. Head north from Tralee and there's more splendid cliff top walking on the Ballybunion Cliff Walk. There's great beaches and lots of wildlife including sea birds on the cliffs and dolphins in the waters below. Also of interest is the popular climb to Carrauntoohil in the MacGillycuddy's Reeks mountain range. Here you can climb to the highest mountain in Ireland and enjoy some incredible views from the summit."
