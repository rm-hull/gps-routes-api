  "description": "There are lots of nice walks to try around the pretty Cumbrian village of Ravenstonedale. The village sits within the Yorkshire Dales National Park on the watershed between the River Lune and River Eden. There's lovely views of the Howgills, riverside paths, limestone pavements and challenging hill climbs to try in this beautiful area. This circular walk starts in the village and heads north along the Scandal Beck to the picturesque Smardale Bridge. You continue along the beck to the impressive Smardale Gill Viaduct. The viaduct is 710 ft (220 m) long and 130 ft (40 m) high. It is surrounded by a delightful nature reserve with a variety of wildlflowers and birds to look out for. After admiring the viaduct the route crosses the Scandal Beck before returning to the village on the opposite side of the water. To extend your walking in the area you could head to nearby Kirkby Stephen and try a nice walk along the River Eden. You can also pick up the Pennine Journey long distance trail around here. If you head south east from the village you can explore the lovely area around Mallerstang and enjoy a climb to Wild Boar Fell for great views over the surrounding area. Around here you can also pick up the Pennine Bridleway and further explore the Pennines on foot or by bike.",
