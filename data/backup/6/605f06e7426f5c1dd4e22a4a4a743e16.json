  "description": "A short route around the delightful Woodgate Valley Country Park in Birmingham. The park contains 450 acres of rich meadows, woodland and small ponds with the Bourn brook running through the heart of the park. There is also an excellent visitor centre and an Urban Farm with a variety of animals to see. To continue your walking in the area you could head a couple of miles to the west and visit the pretty Leasowes Park. Here you'll find more good footpaths taking you to 141 acres of woodland, grassland, streams, waterfalls and large ponds. The Illey Way also starts from Woodgate. The path runs along an old railway line from Waseley Hills to Woodgate, passing through some nice countryside.",
