  "description": "This circular walk explores the village of Old Basing in Basingstoke, Hampshire. The area includes the historic Basing House, a Tudor Tithe Barn, Basingstoke Common and the Basing Lime Pits. The walk starts in the village close to Basing House which is one of the primary features of the area. It was built in the 16th century and was the home of the Marquesses of Winchester for several generations before being destroyed during the English Civil War. You can now explore the Tudor ruins and gardens which are operated and funded by Hampshire Cultural Trust. After exploring the house you can make your way south west across the common to visit the Basing Lime Pits. There's more nice trails around this park and another parking area if you would like to start the walk from here. The route then heads north east past the civil war earthworks to return to the start point.",
