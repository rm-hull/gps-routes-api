  "description": "This pretty Peak District village is in a fine location for exploring the mills and caves of the River Manifold Valley and the White Peak. This circular walk from the village visits the historic Wetton Mill and the fascinating Thor's Cave before climbing to Wetton Hill for some great views. The walk starts in the village and follow footpaths west past Hallfields farm to the Thors Cave. Inside the cave you can enjoy the fascinating rock formations and mineral colours. There are great views of the Manifold Valley through the cave entrance. Here you can also pick up the Manifold Way and follow the waymarked footpath north along the River Manifold to visit Wetton Mill. Here you can stop off for some refreshments at the tea room which is located in one of the former grist buildings. The route then heads north east along a track to Hillside Farm before heading south past Wetton Hill. There's splendid views over the surrounding countryside to enjoy from here. You can descend back to the village from here.",
