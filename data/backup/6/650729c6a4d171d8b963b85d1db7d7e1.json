  "description": "This walk climbs to the hill fort and view point at Carn Llidi near St David's on the stunning Pembrokeshire coast. The walk starts from the car park at Whitesands Bay (Porth Mawr) and follows paths east and then north to the hill summit which stands at a height of 181 metres. Here you'll find ancient burial chambers and splendid views to the coast at St David's Head and the nearby Ramsey Island. It's about a 1 mile walk to the summit from the car park with some concrete steps as you approach the summit. After taking in the views the route descends on the same paths back to the car park.",
