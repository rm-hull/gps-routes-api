      "caption": "Scrabo Tower Designed by Charles Laynon, the tower was built in 1857 as a memorial to Charles Stewart, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, who died in 1854. The design for the tower was held as a competition, with a strict limit of cost set at \u00a32000. Lanyon's effort only came fourth in the competition but his design was chosen as it fell within the required budget - in actual fact the 135 foot tower was to cost \u00a33010 to complete. The foundation stone was laid on March 6th 1857 in an elaborate ceremony attended by the new Marquess and Marchioness, the Bishop of Down and many of the county's gentry, preceded to the top of the hill by the Marquess's Highland piper. A jar was cemented into the foundations containing an inscribed scroll to the late Marquess, copies of local and national newspapers of the day, an Ordnance Survey map of County Down, coins of the realm and a list of 600 subscribers who contributed towards the cost of the tower - the list was headed by the Emperor Napoleon III of France."

  "description": "Scrabo Hill and country park is located near Newtownards in County Down, Northern Ireland. You can follow footpaths to the top of the hill where you will find the well known landmark Scrabo Tower. The 19th century tower is 125 feet (38 m) high and visible for miles around. The views from the summit of Scrabo Hill extend to Strangford Lough, the Mourne Mountains and the Scottish coast. You can pick up the footpath from the car park. It's a short climb of less than half a mile but quite steep. After descending the hill you can continue to explore Scrabo Country Park. There are nice woodland trails through Killynether Woods with lots of bluebells in the springtime. To extend your walking in the area you pick up the Comber Greenway from nearby Comber. This cycling and walking trail runs along National Cycle Network route 99 and a disused railway line from Belfast to Comber.",
