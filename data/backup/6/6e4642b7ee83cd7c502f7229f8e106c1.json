  "description": "Explore 15 lakes in over 600 acres of country park on this super cycle or walk in Warwickshire. There are many miles of surfaced paths around the lakes, with a bridleway around the southern perimeter of the Park. These are suitable for cyclists and bike hire is available in the park. Please note that no cycling is allowed through the Woodland Walk, around the Nature Reserve at the Broomey Croft side of the Park, or in the Visitor Centre courtyard. The park is excellent for birdwatching with a number of hides situated around the lake. There is also a miniature railway and an excellent visitor centre. The Heart of England Way and the Warwickshire Centenary Way walking routes run through the park so there is the option of continuing your walk. The park is located on the River Tame about 8 miles from Birmingham. On the western side of the park you can pick up the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and enjoy a waterside cycle or walk towards Birmingham or Fazeley. If you head north along the canal you will soon come to the lovely Middleton Lakes RSPB nature reserve. The reserve has several well laid out walking trails taking you to meadows, woodland and lakes.",

      "content": "Head south and you can visit Shustoke Reservoir where there's a fine circular trail around the picturesque lake. The Coleshill Walk also visits the reservoir from the nearby town. On the way it stops off at the pretty Cole End Nature Reserve on the River Cole. The historic town is also a fine place for a stroll with a series of old coaching inns and a noteworthy 13th century church to investigate. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
