  "description": "This walk visits the impressive Cathedral Quarries in Little Langdale. The cave system includes the 40ft high Cathedral Cavern which is a popular destination for walkers in this area of the Lake District. The circular route runs for about 2 miles with a few small climbs along the way. Start the walk from the car park at Hodge Close where there's some spendid lakeland views. From the elevated spot you can see several fells including Lingmoor, Bowfell and the Pike of Blisco. Hodge Close is an unusual area with a series of striking quarries, pools of water, steep cliff faces and mine tunnel entrances to see. After exploring the quarries the route heads north west, passing between the Klondyke Quarry and Quarry Wood. Continue north, passing the Moss Rigg Quarry and Moss Rigg Wood before coming to the Cathedral Cavern complex. Here you can enter a tunnel and follow it to the forty foot high chamber known as 'The Cathedral'. There are also other tunnels to explore, but please take care as many of them are very dark and require a torch. After exploring the site, you turn east to follow the River Brathay pass Pierce How to Stang End. Turn south here to follow footpaths past Sepulchre Wood and the Wyth Bank Coppice before returning to the car park. You could also visit the site from the nearby village of Elterwater if you prefer. It's about a 2 mile hike from the village, passing Sawrey's Wood just to the south west. You can continue your walking here by trying the lovely Elterwater Waterfalls Walk and visiting Skelwith Bridge .",
