  "description": "Visit the Glenfinnan Viaduct viewpoint and enjoy wonderful views over Loch Shiel, on this wonderful circular walk in the Scottish Highlands. It's a fabulous piece of architecture with the beautiful mountains making a wonderful backdrop. The viaduct is the longest concrete railway bridge in Scotland at 416 yards (380 m), and crosses the River Finnan at a height of 100 feet (30 m). The best time to go is in the summer when you can see the Jacobite steam train running from Glenfinnan to Fort William and Mallaig. The viaduct featured in four of the Harry Potter film series with the Hogwarts Express passing along the same route. The walk starts from the car park on the Glenfinnan Pier Road, just to the north of the River Finnan. From here you can pick up a footpath heading east towards the viaduct. A path then climbs above the viaduct on the northern side of the railway line, before descending through woodland and returning to the car park. You can then cross the river and visit the Glenfinnan Monument. The 18 m (60 ft) monument, sits at the head of the loch. It commemorates the Jacobite Rising of 1745, which began here when Prince Charles Edward Stuart ('Bonnie Prince Charlie') raised his standard on the shores of Loch Shiel. You can climb to the top of the monument and then head to the visitor centre where you can learn about the history of the area. The first part of the walk uses a section of the Cape Wrath Trail. You can follow the trail north along the River Finnan and through Glen Finnan to extend your walking in the area. You can also head to Polloch and enjoy a nice walk along the River Polloch to the loch and surrounding woodland.",

      "content": "The Glenfinnan House Hotel is a fine place to unwind after your walk. It's a special place with a lovely lawn stretching down to the shores of the loch. You can sit outside and enjoy a drink with wonderful views. The hotel also has an interesting history, built as an inn between 1752 and 1755 by Alexander MacDonald VII of Glenaladale who was wounded at Culloden (1746) fighting for Prince Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie). It's located close to the pier at postcode PH37 4LT."

      "content": "The pier at Glenfinnan is located very close to this walk. After your walk you could head here and enjoy a boat trip across Loch Shiel with Highland Cruises. It's a great experience and offers fine views back to the viaduct from the boat. There's also the opportunity to look out for wildlife including red deer and eagles. From nearby Mallaig you can catch the Knoydart ferry to Inverie where you can visit Britain's remotest Pub. The Knoydart and Inverie Walk will then take you through the mountains along the Old Road to Kingloch Hourn."
