  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Annascaul Lake on the\u00a0Dingle Peninsula\u00a0in\u00a0County Kerry. It's a remote and peaceful spot in a picturesque green river valley surrounded by striking mountainous scenery. The walk starts from the village of Annascaul which lies just to the south of the lake. From here you can follow quiet country lanes north to the lake. There's a nice track running along the western side of the lough with views across the water to the surrounding mountains. You can then continue north along the river to visit a series of pretty waterfalls on the Garrivagh River.",
