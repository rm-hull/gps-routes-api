  "description": "This walk follows a beautiful section of the Durham heritage coast from Seaham to Crimdon Park, just outside Hartlepool. The path starts by Seaham harbour and heads south to Easington Colliery, passing Shippersea Bay and the lovely Hawthorn Dene on the way. This delightful reserve is run by the Durham Wildlife Trust and consists of woodland and limestone hay meadows. The path continues south, passing Horden and Peterlee with more stunning cliff top views. Around Peterlee you will pass the wonderful Castle Eden Dene National Nature Reserve. It is the largest area of semi-natural woodland in north-east England and a major highlight on the route. The last section of the walk then takes you to the finish point at Crimdon Park just north of Hartlepool.",

It's positioned at the top of the cliff so there are some wonderful views through the wide windows or in the outdoor seating area. You can find them at postcode TS27 4BL for your sat navs. They are dog friendly."
