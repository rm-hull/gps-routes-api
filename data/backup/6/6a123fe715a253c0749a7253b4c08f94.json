  "description": "Climb the famous Old Man of Storr on this stunning walk on the Isle of Skye. The walk takes you to the 719 m (2,359 ft) high summit on well constructed paths. The walk starts at car park located at the northern end of Loch Leathan and follows a well defined path to Needle Rock and then on to Coire Scamadal. You then double back and ascend to the summit of the Storr where there are some truly breathtaking views. The Trotternish Ridge stretches away to the north, while the Islands of Harris, Raasay and Rona are all visible to the east. To the south are great views across the Isle of Skye to the Cuillin mountains. You descend following the rim of Coire Faoin towards Bealach Beag and then down to the side of Loch Leathan before finishing back at the car park.",

      "content": "For another climb on the island head to the Quiraing, the northernmost summit of the Trotternish. The hike is a favourite for many with some spectacular views to enjoy. For an easier local walk try the delightful Fairy Pools, Fairy Glen, the Falls Of Rha and the Uig Woodland Walk. Just to the north is Kilt Rock And Mealt Falls where there's a pretty loch, some wonderful rock formations and a coastal waterfall to see. Head south and you can visit the Island's capital at Portree. Here you can pick up the circular Portree Scorrybreac Walk and enjoy views of the picturesque harbour, the colourful buildings of Portree town and out to the Island of Raasay. For more walking ideas in the area see the Isle of Skye Walks page."
