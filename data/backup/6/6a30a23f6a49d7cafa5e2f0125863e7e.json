  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the lovely Llwyn-on Reservoir on the edge of the Brecon Beacons. It's about a 3 mile walk around the lake so should take about an hour. You can start the walk at the south eastern end of the water where there is some lay by parking. From here you can pick up the Taff Trail and follow it along the western side of the reservoir. This takes you towards the Coed Taf Fawr where you can cross the river on a bridge at the northern end. You can then follow another footpath south along the eastern side of the reservoir. The lake attracts various water loving birds which you can look out for from the bird hide. Also look out for the environmental sculptures which can be found on the Wern and Willow walks.",

      "content": "Just to the north is Nant Ddu where there's a pleasant trail along a pretty stream with waterfalls and more nice views. Near here there's more waterside trails around Cantref Reservoir. Head due east from the reservoir and you will soon come to Pontsticill Reservoir and Pentwyn Reservoir. Near here there's also some fine woodland trails in the Taf Fechan Forest and more waterside walks along the Upper and Lower Neuadd Reservoirs. You could also head into Merthyr Tydfil to enjoy walks along the River Taff and visit the Grade I listed Cyfarthfa Castle and gardens."
