  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the Norfolk village of Costessey. The village is located just to the west of the city of Norwich and has some nice country trails to follow. This route uses part of the Marriot's Way and other public footpaths to take you through the countryside to the north and east of the village. On the way there's nice views of the valleys of the rivers Wensum and Tud which flow through the area. The area around Hellesdon Mill and bridge is particularly scenic. Just to the north west of the village you could extend the walk at Taverham Mill. The mill is actually a wildlife rich nature reserve with three colour coded walking trails taking you to grassland, woodland, water meadow and a wild flower meadow.",
