The abbey is one of the most historically significant monastic sites in the region. Founded in 1195 by Donal M\u00f3r O'Brien, King of Thomond, it was the first and largest Augustinian house in the county. The abbey's remains are quite extensive, featuring a church with a belfry, and two ranges of domestic buildings to the east and south, all arranged around a cloister garth. Interestingly, unlike many other monasteries, Clare Abbey lacks a west range."

      "caption": "The church likely dates back to the late 12th century, though the tower situated between the chancel and the nave was added in the 15th century. Among the most notable architectural features are the three inserted 15th-century traceried windows. Two of these are located in the chancel, including the pointed three-light east window, which is adorned with a small carving of a human face above the hood. Additionally, an elaborate design of cusped tracery, consisting of six trefoils and a quatrefoil, was inserted above the original window in the south gable of the east range. This design is framed within a richly moulded projecting hood, adding to the site\u2019s architectural interest. Despite its relative simplicity, Clare Abbey's tranquil setting and historical features make it a worthwhile destination for those interested in Ireland's monastic heritage."
