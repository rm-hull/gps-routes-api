  "description": "This walk takes you from the Lake District village of Dacre to the Dalemain House Estate. The country house near Ulswater is surrounded by acres of pretty gardens, woodland and parkland. The gardens are particularly lovely winning the Historic Houses Association Garden of the Year Award in 2013. These include a Tudor Knot Garden and the delightful Wild Garden with its pond and riverside walks along the River Eamont. This walk follows a good footpath which runs from Dacre to the house. The path runs for just over a mile through the wider estate. You'll pass the deer park with 60 fallow deer and some lovely countryside. Dacre is a very pretty village with the 14th century moated Dacre Castle and an 18th century coaching inn, The Horse & Farrier. The church of St Andrew is also beautiful with memorials to the Dalemain family inside.",
