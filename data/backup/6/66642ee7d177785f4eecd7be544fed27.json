  "description": "This coastal walk uses a lovely section of the South West Coast Path to take you from Bude to the beautiful Widemouth Bay. It's about a 3.5 mile walk from the town to the bay, using an undulating waymarked path. On the way there are some great viewpoints with fine views across Bude Bay. The walk starts in Bude by crossing the canal and heading west to Bude Haven. The path then heads south to Compass Point where there are some interesting cliff formations. You continue to Efford Beacon where you'll find a trig point and fine views back down to Bude. The path then passes Upton and Philllp's point where there is a small nature reserve. From here you continue pass Salthouse before coming to Widemouth Bay. There's a lovely beach here and you can also enjoy refreshments at the excellent Beach House Hotel. The area around the bay is steeped in the smuggling history of times before, and not far south of Widemouth Bay can be found many little inlets and coves. You can turn it into a longer circular walk by heading east to Helebridge where you can pick up the Bude Canal . You can then follow the easy waterside path north back into Bude. At the southern end of the canal there's the village of Marhamchurch where there's a noteworthy 14th century church to see. The circular walk from the village uses the shared cycle path running through the River Neet valley.",
