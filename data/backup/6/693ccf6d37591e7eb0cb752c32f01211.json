  "description": "These woods near Market Rasen have miles of good footpaths and cycling trails to try. This route follows the Lindsey Trail which runs through the centre of the forest for about 1.5 miles. You can start from the car park just off the Willingham Road from Market Rasen. If you are bringing your bike to the woods please keep on the stone paths. Walkers can further explore the site on a number of alternative footpaths marked on the maps below. There's pretty ponds and wildlife including woodland birds and deer to look out for. The site also has a good kisok a with wide range of hot and cold snacks, drinks and ice cream. To continue your walking in the area head east towards the village of Tealby where you can pick up the Viking Way long distance trail. It will take you on a tour of the beautiful Lincolnshire Wolds .",
