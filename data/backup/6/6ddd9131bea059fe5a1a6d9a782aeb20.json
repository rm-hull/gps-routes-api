      "caption": "Slains Castle. The castle was originally built in the 16th century and expanded over the years, with significant remodelling carried out in the 1830s in the Scots Baronial style. It was the seat of the Earls of Erroll until it fell into ruin in the 20th century. The castle is also linked to Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, with many claiming it inspired the author's vision for Count Dracula\u2019s castle. Although the castle itself did not directly influence the plot of Dracula, Stoker\u2019s visits to Cruden Bay during the 1890s are believed to have shaped his descriptions of the eerie, cliff-side fortress in the novel."

As you approach the castle, you will see the jagged coastline dotted with wildflowers and grasses, and you may also spot seabirds such as puffins, gulls, and kittiwakes. The Buchan Coastal Footpath is known for its rugged terrain, which includes rocky outcrops, sea caves, and natural arches. The area is also home to marine life, including seals and occasionally dolphins in the waters below."

  "description": "This walk takes you to Slains Castle on Aberdeenshire\u2019s coastline. You can start your walk from the public car park off the A975 near Cruden Bay. Head east to the coast and you can pick up the Buchan Coastal Footpath. Follow the trail south along the cliff tops and it will take you to Slains Castle (or New Slains Castle to distinguish it from the nearby Old Slains Castle). Here you can explore the ruins while enjoying some splendid coastal views. To continue your walking in the area head north along the coast to visit the wonderful rock formations at the Bullers Of Buchan. The nearby village of Cruden Bay also offers further exploration, with its sandy beach and golf course.",
