  "description": "This walk takes you to the Stepping Stones on the Sher Brook in the Cannock Chase AONB. The scenic spot is located just to the south east of Milford. You can start the walk from the car park on the common and follow trails south east to reach the stones. Along the way there's peaceful woodland paths and lots of wildlife to see. The area around the stones is a lovely place for a picnic and a dog walk.",
