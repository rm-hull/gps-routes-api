  "description": "This country park has mature trees, woodland, and large grassy areas to explore. Look out for a variety of woodland birds,  foxes, and small mammals as you make your way along the footpaths. It's a popular place with a free car park and plenty of easy, surfaced trails to try. The park is located near Cleethorpes and Grimsby . Cleethorpes Country Park is less than a mile away so you could continue your walk there and then along the nearby Cleethorpes seafront.",
