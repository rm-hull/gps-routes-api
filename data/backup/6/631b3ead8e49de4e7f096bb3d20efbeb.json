  "description": "This walk visits the Cambourne Nature Reserve before heading to the neighbouring villages of Caxton and Bourn. The reserve is located in the new Cambridgeshire village of Cambourne which was created in the 1990s. The area is very pleasant for walking with nice footpaths through the reserve and trails along the Bourn Brook to enjoy. It lies just to the west of the famous university city of Cambridge. The walk begins at the nature reserve where car parking is available. There's pretty lakes, wildflower meadow, wetland and a large variety of wildlife to see here. Look out for badgers and deer in the woods and great crested newts in the ponds. Birds include skylark and meadow pipit with various wildfowl to be seen on the lakes. Follow the trails south west through the reserve and you can then follow the Crow Dean track to Caxton village. At the southern end of the village you can pick up a footpath along the Bourn Brook and follow it south east to visit Bourn. Here you can visit the ancient Bourn Windmill and enjoy refreshments at the local pub. The windmill is notable as the oldest surviving windmill in the United Kingdom. The Grade I listed mill dates back to 1636 and is open as a tourist attraction on certain days of the year.",
