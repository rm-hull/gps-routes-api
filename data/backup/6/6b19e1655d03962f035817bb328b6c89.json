This colliery closed in 1993 and there is little left on the surface to show what was once here apart from an old railway track (middle distance) and air vent covers (left). A large proportion of the site was developed into the country park along the Grantham Canal which follows the line of the trees. Some of the site has been redeveloped as a light industry estate on Holygate Lane."

  "description": "This lovely country park near Nottingham is the perfect place for a peaceful cycle or walk. The park includes woodland, wetland, lakes and informal grassland while the Grantham canal also runs through the park. You could continue your exercise along the Grantham Canal and visit the nearby village of Hickling where there's a nice canalside pub. If you head a couple of miles north where you'll find the Holme Pierrepont Country Park and Colwick Country Park . Cotgrave is located just a few miles south east of Nottingham city centre, near the market town of West Bridgford .",
