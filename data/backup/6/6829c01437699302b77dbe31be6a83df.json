  "description": "Follow the valley of the River Dart on this lovely walk through Devon. The walk starts at Eggesford Barton near the train station and heads towards Chawleigh and then Leigh Bridge where you join the river. The route continues to West and East Worlington before finishing at Witheridge. There is a 3 mile link section from Chulmleigh to Eggesford at the western end of the route. Here you can explore Eggesford Forest with its Douglas Fir trees, pretty streams, ancient motte and bailey castle and lots of interesting flora and fauna.",
