  "description": "Explore the gardens and 65 acre wider estate on this short walk in the Quantock Hills. In the estate you'll find three waymarked walking trails taking you to the most interesting areas on well surfaced paths. You'll visit the fine courtyard with a coach house, stable, library and music room. The trail then takes you into the beautiful gardens with a serpentine lake, boathouse, round-towered folly and a walled garden with ornamental trees and shrubs. There are also lovely woodland sections with beech trees and bluebells in spring. If you'd like to continue your walk then you could pick up the Samaritans Way South West and head up to the nearby Broomfield Hill and Cothelstone Hill where there are fabulous views over the Quantocks. This runs just to the north of the estate. Fyne Court is located just a few miles from Bridgwater.",
