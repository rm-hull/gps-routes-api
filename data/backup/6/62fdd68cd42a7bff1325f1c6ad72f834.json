  "description": "This historic market town is located in the Wealden district of East Sussex Walking highlights in the area include the popular Cuckoo Trail , a shared cycling and walking route running along an old railway line from Heathfield towards the coast at Eastbourne. Just south west there's Abbot's Wood and Wilmington Woods where you will find miles of walking paths and mountain bike trails.  The long distance Wealdway can also be picked up to the west of the town. This walk from Hailsham takes you west to visit the historic Michelham Priory. You can start the walk in the town next to the picturesque Hailsham Pond. From here you can pick up a section of the Cuckoo Trail and follow it north before turning west to pick up the Wealdway near Welbury Farm. The waymarked footpath will then take you west to the priory. The former Augustine Priory dates from the 13th century and includes some original buildings which are Grade I and Grade II listed. It's a lovely place for a stroll with the photgenic old priory buildings, a long moat, a water mill and some lovely gardens to admire.",
