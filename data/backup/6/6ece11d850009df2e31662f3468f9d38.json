  "description": "This historic Cumbrian village near Carlisle has some lovely riverside trails, peaceful local woods and the remains of ancient priory to see. This walk from the village takes you south along the River Eden to visit Wetheral Woods. The walk starts from the train station, next to Corby Bridge and heads south along a riverside footpath to the National Trust managed woods. You continue to Cote House where you will pass Coathouse Tower and Coathouse Island in the river. The walk finishes at Brackenbank but you could continue south to Edenbrows Wood and Holmwrangle. On the way you can take a slight detour from the route to visit the Wetheral Priory Gatehouse. The ancient structure is the sole survivor of a small Benedictine priory. The miniature 'pele-tower' contains two storeys of comfortable rooms and later became a fortified vicarage.",
