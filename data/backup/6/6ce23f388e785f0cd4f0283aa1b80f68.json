  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this pretty area of woodland and heathland near Stone, in Staffordshire. The area is also known as Barlaston Downs and is run by the National Trust so there is a car park and good walking trails to follow through the area. There is some climbing on the walk but you are rewarded with splendid views over the Staffordshire countryside from the Millennium Viewpoint. There is also a pretty stream with marshland and wildflowers next to it. The route below is designed for walkers but cyclists can follow a waymarked bridleway through the site. If you feel like continuing your walk then you could pick up the Trent and Mersey Canal which runs through Barlaston. You could follow it towards Trentham and visit the lovely Trentham Gardens .",
