  "description": "This short circular walk climbs to a splendid viewpoint in North Yorkshire, near Harrogate. You can start the walk from the village of North Rigton, just to the east of the hill. The area around the village was used for scenery at the end of Yorkshire Television dramas, The Beiderbecke Affair, The Beiderbecke Tapes and The Beiderbecke Connection. From the village you can pick up footpaths heading west up to the crag. The large outcrop of Millstone Grit stands at a height of almost 700ft, offering lovely views over the surrounding Wharfe Valley countryside. You will often see rock climbers traversing one of the impressive, large rocky outcrops. If you look to the south you can get a great view of one of the architectural highlights of the area at Arthington Viaduct. The historic Grade II listed structure dates from 1845 and is (460 m) in length, with 21 semi-circular arches on high piers. After taking in the views you can descend the same way or return via Crag Lane to turn it into a circular walk. Back in the village you can reward yourself with refreshments at the very fine Square and Compass pub. To continue your walking in the area you could head north to Pannal Hall and pick up the Harrogate Ringway long distance trail. The waymarked footpath will take you on a tour of the countryside and villages surrounding the town.",

      "content": "\"Almscliffe Crag is an amazing spot for climbers and walkers alike! The gritstone formations are impressive, and the views from the top are absolutely breathtaking. Just make sure to park responsibly along the roads and follow the designated access paths.\"  \"The crag offers a fantastic range of climbing routes, suitable for all levels. It can get a bit busy on weekends, but it\u2019s well worth it. Remember to respect the land as it\u2019s on private property, and keep the noise down to maintain a good relationship with the local farmer.\"  \"I had a wonderful day at Almscliffe Crag! The walking paths are well marked, and the scenery is perfect for photography. Just be careful not to walk on the dry stone walls as they are easily damaged.\"  \"A great place for outdoor enthusiasts! Almscliffe Crag is not just for climbers; it\u2019s also perfect for a leisurely walk or a picnic with family and friends. The access path is a nice touch, making it easier to get to the crag without ruining the surrounding area.\"  \"Almscliffe Crag is a hidden treasure! I loved exploring the various climbing routes and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. Just a tip: parking can be limited, so try to arrive early to find a good spot.\""
