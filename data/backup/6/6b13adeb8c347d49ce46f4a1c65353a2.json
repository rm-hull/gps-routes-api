Notably, it featured in the opening credits of the ITV soap opera Emmerdale from 1998 to 2005. Additionally, the crag serves as the concluding scene for each series of The Beiderbecke Trilogy. Its earlier screen appearance includes being portrayed as the planet Obsidian in the BBC sci-fi series Blake's 7, specifically in the third episode of its third season, which aired in 1980."

  "description": "This short circular walk climbs to a splendid viewpoint in North Yorkshire, near Harrogate. You can start the walk from the village of North Rigton, just to the east of the hill. The area around the village was used for scenery at the end of Yorkshire Television dramas, The Beiderbecke Affair, The Beiderbecke Tapes and The Beiderbecke Connection. From the village you can pick up footpaths heading west up to the crag. The large outcrop of Millstone Grit stands at a height of almost 700ft, offering lovely views over the surrounding Wharfe Valley countryside. You will often see rock climbers traversing one of the impressive, large rocky outcrops. If you look to the south you can get a great view of one of the architectural highlights of the area at Arthington Viaduct. The historic Grade II listed structure dates from 1845 and is (460 m) in length, with 21 semi-circular arches on high piers. After taking in the views you can descend the same way or return via Crag Lane to turn it into a circular walk. Back in the village you can reward yourself with refreshments at the very fine Square and Compass pub. To continue your walking in the area you could head north to Pannal Hall and pick up the Harrogate Ringway long distance trail. The waymarked footpath will take you on a tour of the countryside and villages surrounding the town.",
