  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Ullswater Way from Glenridding to the beautiful Aira Force Waterfall. The route follows paths alongside the lake with a section on the road where care should be taken. The walk starts at the main parking area in Glenridding, near to the pier and tourist information centre. Follow the trail north to Stybarrow Crag, Mossdale Bay and Glencoyne, where you cross the Glencoyne Beck. The route continues through Glencoyne Park, an area which inspired William Wordsworth to write the poem 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud'. After passing through the park you come to Aira Force where you will find a spectacular 65ft high waterfall. There's also a series of lovely woodland trails with Himalayan firs, red squirrels and views of the Aira Beck. To extend your walking in this delightful area of the Lake District you could enjoy a climb to Gowbarrow Fell just above the falls. There's splendid views over the lake from here. The National Trust's Great Mell Fell lies a little further to the north. You could also try the Howtown to Glenridding Walk. It's considered the finest lakeside walk in the National Park. On the way you can enjoy a climb to Hallin Fell for great views over the lake and surrounding fells.",
