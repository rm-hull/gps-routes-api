  "description": "This short circular walk climbs to Crooksbury Hill near Farnham in Surrey. There's a car park directly below the hill where you can pick up a short trail to take you to the hill summit. From here you can enjoy fine views over the surrounding countryside of the North Downs. The route then descends through the pine woodland to the ancient earthwork at Soldiers Ring. You can then follow a bridleway south and then west to return you to the car park. You can extend the walk by heading a short distance south east to Crooksbury Common. Here you'll find some nice woodland and heathland to explore.",
