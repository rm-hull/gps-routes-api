  "description": "Visit these beautiful falls and enjoy a woodland stroll along the Afon Teifi on this walk in Carmarthenshire. It's a stunning sight when the river is in full flow with the water rushing over a cascade of waterfalls. The area is also well known for leaping salmon. You can see them jumping up the falls in the autumn months. You can start your walk from the car park next to the 18th century Cenarth Bridge. From here you can enjoy a walk across the bridge where there is a great view down the river to the falls. Then head back to the car park and follow the riverside trail east through the wooded valley, looking out for the old water mill as you go. The trail runs for about half a mile but you can extend the walk by following the track north away from the river if you have time. After your walk you can pop into the lovely gift shop and cross the bridge to visit the pretty church. There's also a\u00a013th century\u00a0flour mill\u00a0and\u00a0coracle\u00a0museum in the village. For post walk refreshments try a cream tea in the garden of the pretty tea rooms. To continue your walking in the area head east and visit the ruined 13th-century castle in nearby Newcastle Emlyn .",
