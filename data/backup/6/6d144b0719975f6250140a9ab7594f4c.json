  "description": "This large town is located in the River Forth Valley in the Central Lowlands of Scotland. There's some fine waterside walks along the Forth and Clyde Canal including the popular Falkirk Wheel to Kelpies Walk which visits two of the highlights of the area. There's also some excellent local country parks to explore including Beecraigs Country Park and Muiravonside Country Park. This walk from the town takes you along a section of the John Muir Way to the nearby Callendar Park. The historic 14th century house is surrounded by 100s of acres of woodland and parkland trails. There's also a section of the Roman Antonine Wall which is classed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The walk starts on the canal next to the Falkirk Wheel and follows the John Muir Way east for about 4 miles to reach the house and park. For more information on the history, climate, local attractions and transport links see the informative wikipedia page.",
