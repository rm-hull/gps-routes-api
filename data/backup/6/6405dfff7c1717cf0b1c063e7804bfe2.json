  "description": "This walk visits the expansive Megget Reservoir in the Scottish Borders. It's a beautiful and tranquil place, ideal for a peaceful walk in stunning surroundings. You can start the walk from one of the car parks at the north eastern end of the site. Then pick up a country lane heading west along the water to the viewpoint and the Cramalt Tower. The tower was used by James V when he came to hunt deer in the area during the 16th century. The trail continues past Pykestone Brae and Clockmore Hill before coming to the western end near Craig Head.",
