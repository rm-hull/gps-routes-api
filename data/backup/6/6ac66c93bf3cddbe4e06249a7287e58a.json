Following outbreaks of cholera and typhoid in nearby Dundee in the 1830s and 40s, reservoirs, including Crombie, were built outside the city to supply clean water to the rapidly growing city. Crombie reservoir became redundant in the 1980s following the construction of much larger reservoirs at Lintrathen and Backwater. It now forms the centrepiece of Crombie Country Park."
