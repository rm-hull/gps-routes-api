  "description": "This walk takes you from the Mumbles to the lovely Caswell Bay on the south east of the\u00a0Gower Peninsula. The route runs for a distance of just over 4 miles on a undulating coastal path, passing Langland Bay on the way. The walk starts from the information point near Oystermouth Castle in the Mumbles. You can then follow the coast path south to Mumbles Head and Limeslade. The route then turns west to take you past Bracelet Bay, Limeslade Bay, Langland Bay and Whiteshell Point before coming to Caswell Bay. Here you'll find a beautiful beach popular with tourists and surfers. The bay has good facilities with two cafes, which are open all year round, toilets and a beach shop.\u00a0Just behind the beach there are some nice woodland trails to try in Bishop's Wood. The nature reserve includes limestone woodland and interesting flora and fauna. You can return on the same paths to the Mumbles or there is a bus that can take you back if you prefer. To extend your walking in the area you could try our Mumbles Circular Walk or head to the Bishopston Valley and visit the beautiful secluded beach at Pwll Du Bay.",
