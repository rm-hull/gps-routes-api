  "description": "This pretty village in Hertfordshire sits in a lovely spot in the centre of the Heartwood Forest. As such there are lots of peaceful woodland trails you can easily access from the village. This walk from Sandridge takes you to the nearby Jersey Farm Woodland Park. The walk starts from the village centre and heads south east to Jersey Lane. Follow the lane south and it will take you into the woodland park where you'll find a number of pleasant footpaths. It's a lovely place for a stroll with a wide variety of flora and fauna to see. The skylark is a popular visitor and you can also see several species of butterfly fluttering around the wildflowers during the warmer months of the year. The village is located close to both Wheathampstead and St Albans where you could pick up the Ver-Colne Valley Walk and enjoy a waterside stroll along the River Ver to the historic Verulamium Park .",
