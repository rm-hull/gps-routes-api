  "description": "Visit this lovely waterfall on this short walk in Langdale in the Lake District. The walk makes use of the Cumbria Way long distance footpath to take you from Skelwith Bridge to the falls. You can park at the car park by the River Brathay at Skelwith Bridge to start your walk. You then cross the bridge and pick up the footpath to the falls. It's a nice footpath climbing through Eltwerwater Park with great views of Elterwater Lake and Little Langdale below. The final section takes you through thick woodland to Colwith Force. It drops 40 feet over several stages and is a spectacular sight when in full spate. You can return to the car park the same way and then enjoy refreshments at the cafe right next to Skelwith Bridge. The falls can also be reached from nearby Elterwater by heading south past Fletcher's Wood. To extend your walk you can continue along the Cumbria Way south and visit the lovely Tarn Hows . Loughrigg Tarn is also a short walk from the Skelwith Bridge car park.",
