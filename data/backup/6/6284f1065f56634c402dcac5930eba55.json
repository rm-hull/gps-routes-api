  "description": "Explore the grounds and woods surrounding this medieval castle in North Yorkshire. The walk takes you along the river which runs past the castle and then into the nearby Skipton Woods where you'll find pleasant woodland trails. You then head up to Park Hill where there are great views of the town and castle. You can also explore the castle grounds with the Tudor courtyard, 12th-century chapel, Conduit Court\u00a0and twin-towered Norman gatehouse. To extend your walking in the Skipton area you can try our Skipton Canal Walk and enjoy a waterside stroll to Gargrave. The Skipton Circular Walk is another good local option. The route takes you into Airedale and climbs Sharp Haw Fell for wonderful views over the town and the surrounding Yorkshire Dales countryside. There's also a pleasant waterside section along the Leeds Liverpool Canal .",
