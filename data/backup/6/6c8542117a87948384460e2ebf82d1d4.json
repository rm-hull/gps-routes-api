  "description": "This walk explores the Dorset Downs, visiting the Iron Age hillfort at Bulbarrow Hill. The area has an interesting history and offers fine views over the Blackmore Vale. There's a car park just to the east of the hill where you can pick up the Wessex Ridgeway to take you across the hill to Rawlsbury Camp. The hill is the second highest in Dorset standing at a height of 274-metres (899 feet). The views from the summit stretch into Somerset, Wiltshire and Devon. To extend your walk you could head north east along the Wessex Ridgeway to Ibberton Hill, Okeford Hill and Blandford Forest. Continue south west and you will come to Ball Hill. Cyclists can reach the hill by following National Cycle Network route 253 from the picture postcard village of Milton Abbas or Okeford Fitzpaine.",
