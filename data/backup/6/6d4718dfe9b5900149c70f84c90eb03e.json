  "description": "This walk takes you around the pretty Burrs Country Park, situated on the River Irwell just north of Bury. Habitats in the park include woodland, open space, wetland, ponds and waterways. You can follow a circular walking trail along the river before heading through Walmersley on the other side of the park. It's about a 2 mile walk so should take under an hour. There's good facilites too with a car park, a visitor centre and a cafe. The Irwell Sculpture Trail runs through the park so you could continue your walk along the River Irwell. If you head north you will soon come into Ramsbottom where you can enjoy a climb to Peel Tower on Holcombe Moor. On the way you'll also pass the attractive Summerseat where there's an impressive six arched viaduct, historic old mills and a heritage railway station on the East Lancs railway. Heading south will take you along the river into Bury .",
