There's good facilites too with a car park, a visitor centre and a cafe. The Irwell Sculpture Trail runs through the park so you could continue your walk along the River Irwell. If you head north you will soon come into Ramsbottom where you can enjoy a climb to Peel Tower on Holcombe Moor. On the way you'll also pass the attractive Summerseat where there's an impressive six arched viaduct, historic old mills and a heritage railway station on the East Lancs railway. Heading south will take you along the river into Bury .",
