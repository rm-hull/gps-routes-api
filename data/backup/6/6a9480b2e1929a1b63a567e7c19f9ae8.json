  "description": "A popular walk from the Northumberland village of Beadnell to Low Newton By Sea along section of the Northumberland Coast Path . It's a lovely area with splendid views over Beadnell Bay and a visit to the National Trust owned Newton Pool Nature Reserve. The delightful village is a popular tourist spot situated in the Northumberland Coast\u00a0Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. As such it's a great base for exploring the area on foot. The walk starts at Beadnell Harbour where there's lots of little fishing boats and an attractive beach with sand dunes. You then pick up the footpaths and head south along the lovely Beadnell Bay with its 2 mile long sandy beach. The area contains a nationally important colony of\u00a0little tern and the largest mainland colony of\u00a0Arctic tern\u00a0in the United Kingdom. After passing the bay you come to Newton Pool. The nature reserve has a number of hides where you can look out for a variety of water loving birds on the small lakes. At the coastal Newton Haven you may also see seals. This walk finishes at the reserve but you can continue south along footpaths to Embleton Bay and the impressive Dunstanburgh Castle . The dramatic ruins are now a popular tourist attraction, standing on a remote headland with fine views of Embleton Bay and Craster. Head north to visit working fishing port of Seahouses , which also serves the tourist trade, being the embarkation point for visits to the Farne Islands . Seahouses to Beadnell The long distance St Oswald's Way also passes through the area and is another good option for extending your walk.",
