  "description": "This walk visits Tilbury Fort on the banks of the River Thames in the Essex town of Tilbury. The historic artillery fort is a popular place for a walk with pleasant paths to follow around moat and along the riverside. There's nice views across the river to Gravesend which can be reached by boat to extend the walk. Today the fort is run as a tourist attraction by English Heritage. Considered the best example of its type in the country the fort has protected London's seaward approach from the 16th century through to the Second World War. A fee is required for entry to the fort but there are free public footpaths and lanes surrounding the site as well. For in depth detail into the history and architecture of the site see the informative wikipedia page.",
