  "description": "This is a circular walk around the magnificent Cheddar Gorge in Somerset. It's England's largest gorge at 400 feet deep and three miles long making it one of the most magnificent natural visitor attractions in the country. It was formed during the last Ice Age when water from melting glaciers formed a river, which gradually carved into the limestone rock creating the spectacular steep cliffs you can see today. This walk is the popular 4 mile circular route around the gorge. It begins at the National Trust shop and information centre where you can pick up more details on this walk which includes some steep climbs, rugged paths and easier woodland sections. Please keep to the signed footpaths as it is dangerous to depart from these. Widlife on the route includes Peregrine falcons and Buzzards which nest in the gorge. Also look out for the rare feral Soay sheep, feral goats and ponies.If you would like to continue your walk you could pick up the West Mendip Way walking route which runs past the gorge. Cyclists can reach the gorge on the Strawberry Line cycle route. Cheddar Reservoir is also nearby with an easy footpath running around the water. It's located just to the west of Cheddar and is a great way to extend your outing after exploring the gorge. On the other side of the gorge you can explore Velvet Bottom, an interesting nature reserve in a dry limestone valley. Just beyond the reservoir is the historic town of Axbridge with its medieval town square, half timbered buildings and the Tudor King John's Hunting Lodge which houses a fine local museum. From the town you can enjoy a climb across Wavering Down on the West Mendip Way and visit the beautiful Crook Peak. From here you can enjoy wonderful views towards the coast and into Wales.",
