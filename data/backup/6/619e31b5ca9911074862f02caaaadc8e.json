It is close to the path from the Monument to Ivinghoe Beacon, shortly after the wooden bridge. Latter addition: The tree is one of the trees in the \"Special Trees and Woods\" project and know as the Candelabra Tree"

  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the splendid viepoint at Ivinghoe Beacon from the Ashridge Estate. The route runs for just under 7 miles with some moderate climbs along the way. The route starts from the National Trust's visitor centre and car park in the estate. From here you can pick up the Monarch's Way and follow it north past Moneybury Hill, Hanging Islay, Duncombe Terrace and Crawley Wood. The trail then passes Steps Hill and Incombe Hole to reach the summit of Ivinghoe Beacon. The hill stands at a height of 233\u00a0m (757\u00a0ft) and commands fine views over the Chiltern Hills and the Vale of Aylesbury. After taking in the views you head east to the adjacent Gallows Hill. The route then heads south across the woodland of The Coombe before passing through Ivinghoe Common to return you to the car park. There's more peaceful woodland trails here with lots of pretty bluebells to look out for in the spring months.",
