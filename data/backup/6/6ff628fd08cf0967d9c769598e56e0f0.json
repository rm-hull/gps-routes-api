  "description": "This coastal walk takes you along a lovely cliff top path from Donabate to Portrane in Fingal. The path is a popular one as it is located just 20km north east of Dublin. The walk starts from the Donabate Beach car park at the southern end of the walk, near to the photogenic 19th century Martello Tower. You then head north along the cliff path with wonderful views over the bay towards Lambay Island. Along the way there's also some interesting geology with limestone cliffs, sheltered coves and mysterious caves. It's about a 2km walk so approximately 4km there and back. To continue your walking in the area head south to pick up the Malahide to Portmarnock Coastal Walk. There's some lovely beaches and lots of sea birds to look out for on the trail.",
