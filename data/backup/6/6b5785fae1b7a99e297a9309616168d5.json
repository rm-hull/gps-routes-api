  "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking trails in this large area of open heathland, woodland and chalk downland in the Surrey Hills. The heathland is very attractive with yellow gorse, bluebell woods and purple heathers in the warmer months. It's great for wildlife too. Look out for badgers, deer and birds such as stonechats, linnets, meadow pipits and woodlarks. It's a great area to visit from London as it's only a short distance from the capital. This circular route starts at the car park and takes you around the edge of the common on good bridleways. There are other trails to try such as the butterfly walk where you could see 25 species of butterfly. There's also the Lizard Trail which visits ponds with newts, frogs and many different water plants. If you'd like to continue your exercise then you could head to the nearby Box Hill Country Park .",
