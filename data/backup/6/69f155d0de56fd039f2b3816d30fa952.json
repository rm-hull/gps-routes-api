  "description": "Follow in the footsteps of royal librarian John Leland during his 16th century survey of Britain's churches and priories. You start at King Alfred's Tower at the north-western edge of the Stourhead in Wiltshire and head west towards Bruton and Castle Cary Walk in Somerset. The route continues to South Cadbury where you will pass Cadbury Castle Iron Age Hill Fort before coming to the pretty village of Queen Camel. The next section takes you to Yeovilton with a short stretch along the River Yeo leading you through the village and on towards Ilchester. The path then turns south towards Montacute where you will pass the National Trust owned 16th century mansion at Montacute House and the delightful Ham Hill Country Park. The final stretch takes you on to the finish point at Ham Hill Country Park where you will find splendid views of the Mendip Hills, Blackdown Hills, Quantock Hills and Dorset Downs.",
