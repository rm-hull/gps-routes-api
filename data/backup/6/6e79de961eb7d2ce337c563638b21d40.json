It was then purchased by the National Trust and leased to the John Lewis Partnership, who restored it over many years. In the 21st century it is still used by the Partnership as a corporate hotel for their employees and retired staff."

The church is the current religious home to the Scouting movement and serves the few residents of the island as well as the Brownsea Island Scout camp. It was created by William Waugh in Gothic style. The church is an example of 18th century Gothic Revival architecture. Inside the church there is a monument to Waugh, as well as the tomb of the late owner of the island, Lady Bonham-Christie. There is a separate monument to Baden-Powell and his wife. The flags of the Scout movement line either side of the main Altar."
