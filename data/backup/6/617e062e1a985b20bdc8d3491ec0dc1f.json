The modern castle dates from between the 15th and early 17th centuries, when the successive ruling families of the Herberts and the Somersets created a luxurious, fortified castle, complete with a large hexagonal keep, known as the Great Tower or the Yellow Tower of Gwent. Surrounded by parkland, water gardens and terraces, the castle was considered by contemporaries to be the equal of any other in England or Wales."

In the aftermath, the castle was slighted, or deliberately put beyond military use; after the restoration of Charles II, the Somersets declined to restore the castle. Raglan Castle became first a source of local building materials, then a romantic ruin. It now attracts visitors as a modern tourist attraction."

  "description": "This Monmouthshire based village is located close to Monmouth and Abergavenny. There's some excellent walks in the nearby Forest of Dean and Wye Valley to enjoy. A fine old castle and a medieval church are two of the highlights of the immediate area. This circular walk from the village visits the historic Raglan Castle which lies just to the north of the settlement. The 15th century fortress is considered one of the grandest castles in the country. Today you can explore the photogenic ruins and enjoy wonderful views of the surrounding countryside. After exploring the castle you can then follow footpaths north to explore the valley of the Barton Brook around Caedina Break and Tregare.",
