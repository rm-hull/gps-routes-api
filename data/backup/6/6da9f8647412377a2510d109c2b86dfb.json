  "description": "This Denbighshire village sits just to the east of Corwen in the beautiful valley of the River Dee. This circular walk from the village uses a section of the Dee Valley Way and other country lanes to explore the area to the east of the settlement. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the waymarked Dee Valley Way and follow it north east to the hills and woodland above Carrog. You'll pass Taith Clwyd and enjoy some wonderful views from the high points on this section. The route then descends to the river where you cross to the other side to visit the neighbouring village of Glyndyfrdwy. Here you can enjoy nice views of the river and stop off for refreshments. The walk then finishes by following a pleasant country lane west to return to Carrog.",
