  "description": "This walk visits Edge Hill from the village of Ratley in Warwickshire. The area is the site of a famous historical battle and includes some pleasant woodland trails, fine views and a noteworthy 18th century inn. The walk starts in Ratley where you can pick up the Macmillan Way long distance trail. Follow the waymarked footpath north west and it will take you to Edge Hill. Here you'll find some woodland trails heading south west towards Westcote Manor. On the way you'll pass the 18th century Castle Inn. From the elevated spot there are some fine views across the surrounding countryside towards the site of the Battle of Edgehill, a\u00a0pitched battle\u00a0of the\u00a0First English Civil War. It was fought on Sunday, 23 October 1642 and was the first battle of the war. The inconclusive result of the battle prevented either faction from gaining a quick victory in the war, which would eventually last four years.",
