  "description": "Visit the second highest waterfall in Scotland on this short walk in Glen Nevis. Steall waterfall is a spectacular sight dropping 120 metres (390 ft) down a rockface. The walk begins at the car park near the falls and follows a good footpath through the lovely Nevis Gorge. You'll pass along the River Nevis, through woodland and meadows with wonderful views of the surrounding mountains. It's a stunningly beautiful place and one of the most popular walks in the area. Highlights on the route include a popular wire rope bridge pictured below and featured in the video. The precarious bridge is a fun way of crossing the Water of Nevis but is not for the faint hearted!",
