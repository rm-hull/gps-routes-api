  "description": "This Hertfordshire based village is located close to the border with Buckinghamshire on the edge of the Chiltern Hills. The village includes a 19th century church and a noteworthy pub dating back to the early 17th century. This walk from the village takes you south to visit the neightbouring village of Latimer. Here you can enjoy riverside footpaths on the Chess Valley Walk and visit Chenies Manor House. The Tudor House is a Grade I listed building and surrounded by award-winning gardens. It's one of the area's major historic highlights. You can reach Latimer by following footpaths south through Baldwin's Wood. It's a delightful place with a number of 17th and 18th century cottages around a village green with an old pump. To continue your walking in the area head east to visit Chipperfield Common. There's miles of peaceful woodland walks and two early Bronze Age burial mounds to see here.",

The Dragon also has an historic Tap Room, for which time has stood still since it was reconstructed in 1838. They serve good quality food which you can enjoy in the lovely enclosed garden. There's also the Bricklayers Arms with its low ceilings, exposed beams and real log fire. You can find them at Hogpits Bottom with postcode HP3 0PH. Both pubs are dog friendly."
