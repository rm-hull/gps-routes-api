  "description": "This walk on Penmon Point visits the Trwyn Du Lighthouse where you can enjoy lovely views towards Puffin Island, Great Orme and Snowdon. It's a splendid section of the Anglesey Coast with nice pebble beaches, interesting rock formations and some nice coastal countryside. It's also great for wildlife watching with seals and dolphins to look out for. You can park at the car park next to the excellent Pilot House cafe and pick up a good walking trail to the lighthouse on Black Point. Then explore the area on more coastal paths. The village of Penmon is also well worth exploring. It has a fascinating history with the 12th century Pemon Priory. Here you can explore the ancients hermits well, the magnificent dove house and the ancients church. You can extend your walk by heading west along the Anglesey Coast Path and visiting the splendid Red Wharf Bay. Here you'll find beautiful beaches, rock pools and interesting rock formations. The bay is an area of outstanding natural beauty and well worth a visit. If you head south along the coast path you will soon come to Beaumaris Castle. The 13 century castle is hugely impressive and there are wonderful views over the Menai Strait towards Lavan Sands, Ceredigion and Snowdonia from the coast path. From Beaumaris you can take a boat trip to visit Puffin Island.",

They also serve delicious Welsh cream teas. The cafe occupies a stunning position looking out towards Puffin Island. The long, low, whitewashed building was originally home to three lighthouse pilots and their families in the early 1800's at which time it was made up of 3 seperate cottages. You can enjoy refreshments with a stunning view either indoors or outdoors if the weather is good."
