  "description": "This Bedfordshire based village is known for its 12th century church and the Champneys Health farm which is used by the rich and famous. For walkers there are some lovely riverside trails to follow along the River Ivel and River Hiz. This walk from the village follows a section of the Kingfisher Way along the River Ivel to the neighbouring village of Langford. On the way there's nice country views, lots of water loving wildlife and the picturesque Langford Mill to admire. You can extend the walk by continuing north along the river to Biggleswade. You can continue your walking in the area by heading south east to Champneys Health farm and Henlow Lakes. There's some nice trails here along the River Hiz towards Arlesey .",
