  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Greenlee Lough Nature Reserve from Hadrian's Wall. The reserve is one of the most significant wetland sites in the UK. It includes a variety of habitats including woodland, bog and grassland. The reserve can be reached by following footpaths from Housesteads on Hadrian's Wall. It's about a 3.5 mile walk from the wall with some moderate climbs along the way. You can start the walk from the Housesteads car park and then head north through the fascinating Roman Fort. You then pick up a section of the Pennine Way to take you towards the lake. A footpath then heads west to take you down towards the water. Here you'll find a bird hide where you can look out for a variety of wildlife including\u00a0wildfowl\u00a0and\u00a0waders. There's also lots of interesting plants to see such as 11 species of pondweed and stonewort. You can continue your walking in the area by picking up the Hadrian's Wall Path and visiting the nearby Crag Lough. Near here you will also find the iconic Sycamore Gap . The famous tree was voted England's tree of the year in 2016.",
