  "description": "This coastal circular walk takes you along the Rougey Cliff Walk in the town of Bundoran in County Donegal. The trail runs for about 5km along fairly flat paths with excellent sea views and some interesting geological rock formations to see on the route. You start from the Bundoran Tourist Information Office and head past the Waterworld and Adventure Park attractions. The walk continues past the attractive Bundoran beach where you pick up the cliff path which bends round to the east. From here there are some glorious views over the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent Championship Golf Course. On the way look out for the photogenic Fairy Bridges, a pair of cliff arches which have been carved by the Atlantic Ocean. The walk then heads south down the Tullan Strand Road before turning west to follow the Main Street back to the tourist office.",
