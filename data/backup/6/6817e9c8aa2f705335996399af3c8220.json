  "description": "Visit the longest and highest aqueduct in Britain and enjoy waterside walking along the Llangollen Canal on this lovely walk in Denbighshire. The site includes a good sized car park from which you can start the walk. There is also a handy information point with details about the history of the impressive structure. The 18-arched stone and cast iron structure is used by narrowboats and was completed in 1805 having taken ten years to design and build. It's now a Grade I listed building and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. From the car park you can follow footpaths south up to the aqueduct which carries the Llangollen Canal over the River Dee. From this elevated position there are wonderful views over the stunning countryside of the Vale of Llangollen and the Dee Valley. The route crosses the structure before heading along the canal and returning along a roadside section of the Offa's Dyke Path. This eventually bends round to the canal where a final waterside section leads you back to the car park. For a longer route you could try the Chirk to Llangollen Canal Walk which starts just to the south of the structure at Chirk. The car park is also the start point for the Panorama Walk which will take you up to the lovely World's End. The attractive gorge is a great place for a walk with pretty streams, little waterfalls and attractive woodland. You could also continue along the canal to the town of Llangollen which is located just a few miles to the west.",
