This quote is from the information notice boards at the site: \"Fleam Dyke is one of Cambridgeshire's most impressive earthworks and a rare surviving example of a chalk grassland environment. Excavations have shown that the Dyke began as a small rampart and ditch in the late 5th century AD. The ditch was enlarged and the rampart reinforced in the sixth century and again in the early 7th cenury. It was probably built by the East Anglian Saxons to control the Icknield Way, the ancient routeway into East Anglia from the west.\" The profile of the dyke is well displayed by the dry grass in the section featured in the photograph."

It is generally assumed to be Anglo-Saxon in origin, although archaeological finds of early and late Bronze Age origin seem to indicate that much older earthworks existed at this location. Fleam Dyke was originally much longer, but has been reduced in length over the years through farming activities. The dyke is one of a number of earthworks in South Cambridgeshire, designed to control and restrict the movement of people. The other earthworks in the vicinity are Devil's Dyke, Brent Ditch and Bran Ditch."

  "description": "This circular walk explores an area of chalk grassland woodland, and farmland using the Roman Road and Fleam Dyke just to the south east of Cambridge. The walk takes place on well-maintained footpaths, bridleways and byways through gently undulating countryside and is waymarked throughout. The route visits Horseheath, West Wickham and West Wratting. Both the Roman Road and Fleam Dyke are significant archaeological sites with sections that are classified as scheduled ancient monuments. The walk starts near Wandlebury Country Park so you could use the car park there.",
