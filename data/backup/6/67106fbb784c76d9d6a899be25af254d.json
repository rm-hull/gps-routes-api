  "description": "This circular walk from Leyburn takes you west to visit one of the highlights of the area at Castle Bolton. You'll also visit the photogenic Redmire Force waterfall and the neighbouring villages of Redmire and Preston-under-Scar. Along the way there are great views of the lovely Wensleydale countryside and riverside paths along the River Ure. The walk starts in the town and heads south west along the Leyburn Shawl Walk to the village of Wensley. Here you can pick up a riverside path along the River Ure heading west to Redimire Force, passing West Witton on the way. The route then heads north to the village of Castle Bolton where you can visit the popular Bolton Castle. The historic 14th century castle includes expansive grounds with lovely gardens, a maze and excellent views from the top of the fortification. The route then heads east to the small village of Preston-under-Scar, passing pockets of woodland on the way. Near here you pick up the Leyburn Shawl again and follow it east to return to Leyburn.",
