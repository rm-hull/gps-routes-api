  "description": "This splendid circular walk takes you around a particularly beautiful area of the South Devon coast. The views over the Yealm Estuary and Wembury Bay are simply stunning. You can also look out for unusual widlife including\u00a0cirl bunting, and seals lying on the rocks below. It's about a 4 mile walk with some moderate climbs along the way. Start the walk from the National Trust car park in Noss Mayo and head north to Newton Creek. From here there's a lovely view over the creek to the picturesque village of Newton Ferrers on the other side. Follow the South West Coast Path west along the creek to Ferry Wood and Cellar Beach which you can visit by climbing down some steps. You continue to Gara Point on the Yealm Estuary. It's a lovely spot with wildflowers, green fields, gorse and wonderful views to Wembury Bay, Plymouth Sound and the Mewstone. The route then turns south east to West Holicombe and Blackstone Point where you turn inland. Footpaths take you through the countryside to Brooking Down Wood before returning to the car park. To extend your walking in the area, catch the ferry over to Newton Ferrers and follow the coast path to the lovely Wembury Point near Yealmpton . You could also continue along Revelstoke Drive to Stoke Point to the east. It was built in the 1880s by the land-owner, Edward Baring, first Lord Revelstoke to take his visitors on spectacular rides",
