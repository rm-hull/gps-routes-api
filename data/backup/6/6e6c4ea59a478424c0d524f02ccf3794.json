  "description": "This circular walk follows a section of the South West Coast Path along the lovely Helford River in Cornwall. The popular estuary includes pretty creeks, old churches, nice beaches and lovely coastal views over Falmouth Bay. The walk starts at Helford Point where you can catch a ferry between Helford and Helford Passage. You head east, passing along the pretty harbour to Treath. You continue to Bosahan Cove and The Gew before coming to Dennis Head. There's lovely views over Falmouth Harbour from here. The route then turns west past Gillan Harbour where you will soon come to St Anthony-in-Meneage. The medieval parish church has a tower and font which dates from the 15th century. The route continues west to the small village of Manaccan where there is another interesting old church. The entrance dates from the Norman period while the rest of the structure is of the 13th and 15th centuries. The church is well known for its 250 year old fig-tree which is growing out of the western part of the south wall of the church. After leaving Manaccan the walk returns to Helford, passing through woodland on the way.",
