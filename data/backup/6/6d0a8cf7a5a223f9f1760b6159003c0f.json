  "description": "Brighton has some lovely coastal walks and splendid hill climbs on the nearby South Downs. One of the most popular is the Undercliff Walk which takes you from Brighton Marina to Saltdean along the sea wall. You can continue your coastal walking on the Brighton to Newhaven Walk which will take you along an exhilarating clifftop path. Our Brighton Coastal Walk runs west from the town along a section of the Monarch's Way long distance path. It takes you to Hove, Portslade and Southwick where there are nice views of Shoreham Harbour. There's also the Brighton to Lewes Walk which crosses the South Downs and visits the pretty Castle Hill Nature Reserve on the way. Around here you can also pick up the South Downs Way and visit the wonderful viewpoint at Ditchling Beacon . Just to the north east of the town is the splendid Devil's Dyke . The beautiful valley stretches for about a mile through the South Downs. It's the longest, deepest and widest 'dry valley' in the UK and a great place for walk. For a relaxing parkland stroll try Stanmer Country Park just to the north of the town. There's some lovely woodland trails and pretty gardens to be found here.",
