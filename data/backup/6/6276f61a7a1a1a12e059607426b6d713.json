  "description": "This fine circular walk around Horsham makes use of three of the walking trails running through the town. You'll follow sections of the Horsham Riverside Walk , the High Weald Landscape Trail and the West Sussex Literary Trail to visit some of the highlights of the area. On the way there's waterside paths along the River Arun, a visit to Warnham Nature Reserve and fine views of the surrounding High Weald countryside. The walk starts in Horsham Park, just to the west of the train station. Head south through the town and you will soon come to the river. Follow the path round to the west and it will take you up to Warnham Mill Pond and Nature Reserve. It's a lovely spot with a 17 acre millpond, marshes, grassland, reed beds, hedges and woodlands. Look out for a variety of wildlife including heron, wildfowl, three species of Woodpecker and kingfisher. After exploring the reserve the walk then picks up a section of the West Sussex Literary Trail to take you through the town and back to the park. You then pick up the High Weald Landscape Trail to take you east towards the river. Following the river round will take you past Hornbrook Farm and Chesworth Farm before returning to the finish point at Horsham Park. To extend your walking in the area you could head east along the High Weald Landscape Trail to St Leonard's Forest . Here you'll find miles of cycling and walking trails with pine woodland, a series of pretty streams and the Whitevane Pond at the north western end of the forest. If you continue along the trail you can visit the villages of Slaugham and Warninglid. Head south of the town and you can visit Southwater Country Park . There's nice trails to follow around the lakes with lots more wildlife to look out for. The Downs Link footpath can also be picked up just to the west of the town. You could follow it all the way to the Southwater Country Park.",
