  "description": "These pretty woods near Whitby have some nice walking trails to try. On the estate you'll find miles of tracks and paths leading to becks, waterfalls and the interesting ruins of Mulgrave Castle. It's a great place to go when the sea front is too windy as the paths are all nicely sheltered. Start your walk on the coast at Sandsend where there is a car park just to the west of the beach. Then follow the paths west along the East Bow Beck and you will come to the castle after a mile or so. The Norman castle is thought to have been built by Nigel Fossard who obtained the property after the Norman Conquest. After rounding the castle you can pick up paths along the Sandsend Beck to lead you back to the car park. Please note the woods are open to the public from dawn to dusk on Wednesdays, Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays throughout the year except for the month of May when they are closed for the entire month. On certain Sundays you can visit the beautiful gardens. See the link below for details. Sandsend is on the Cleveland Way so it's easy to extend your walk along the coast. Heading east will take you into Whitby, while heading north takes you to the lovely Runswick Bay .",
