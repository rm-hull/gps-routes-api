It is considered a \"famous\" sea stack climb with at least four routes to the top."

  "description": "Visit one of the most beautiful beaches in Great Britain on this wonderful walk in Sutherland. The route follows a 4 mile track from Blairmore, passing a series of pretty lochs through peat moorland to the coast. The walk starts at the car park in the little hamlet of Blairmore and soon picks up the trail to the coast. You'll first pass Loch Aisir, Loch na Gainimh and Loch a Mhuilinn before the wonderful stretch of coast comes into view. There's great views of the Cape Wrath cliffs and the lovely Sandwood Loch on this final section. The beach is absoultely stunning with sand dunes, cliffs and an unusual sea stack named Am Buachaille.  It's about a mile long so you can enjoy a long stroll along the beach before heading back to Blairmore on the same path. The Sandwood coast is a great place for wildlife spotting. Look out for dolphins and a variety of birds including Guillemots, Razor Bills and Shags.",
