  "description": "This walk explores the woodland and lakes surrounding the Speech House Hotel in the Forest of Dean. It's a pleasant area for a walk with a public car park and lots of tranquil trails to follow around the Speech House Woodland Inclosure. On the way you'll also pass the pretty Speech House Lake, Woorgreens Lake, Spruce Ride and the attractive Cyril Hart Arboretum. The Spruce Ride section takes place on a nice wide track that is also suitable for cyclists. There's also the Speech House Hotel where you could stop off for afternoon tea in the Orangery. The hotel is of some historical significance being housed in a former 17th-century hunting lodge. It's easy to extend the walk by picking up the popular Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail. The start point for the walk at the visitor centre is also located just off Speech House Road.",

      "content": "The lovely Cannop Ponds lie just over a mile to the south west. The tranquil beauty spot is a fine place to extend your walk if you have time. Right next to the ponds there's also the Nagshead Nature Reserve to explore. The RSPB reserve includes a Visitor centre, viewing hides, two waymarked trails, a picnic area and lots of wildlife. To the south there's the New Fancy Viewpoint. Set on the site of the old coal mine the viewpoint is a fine place to watch birds of prey soaring through the skies above. There's also the 'Roll of Honour' sculpture and the Geomap - a map you can walk on showing the underlying geology of the forest. A car park and picnic area add to the attraction. For more walking ideas in the area see the Forest of Dean Walks page."
