    "description": "Enjoy a circular walk from Grasmere to Easedale Tarn in the Lake District National Park. The walk begins in the popular village of Grasmere and follows the Easedale Road towards the pretty Easedale Beck. You then join footpaths taking you up to the tarn, passing the beautiful Sourmilk Gill waterfalls on the way. The tarn is in a lovely spot between Tarn Crag to the north and Blea Rigg to the south. It is generally quite a peaceful spot and a great escape from the often busy Grasmere town. There is a footpath around the tarn though this may be quite boggy. From the tarn, you return via Cockly Crag, Stenners Crag and Jackdaw Crag, before rejoining the Easedale Road back into Grasmere. Another option is to continue to the nearby Stickle Tarn and Dungeon Ghyll Waterfall. You can do this by following the footpath west from Easedale Tarn rather than returning to Grasmere.",
