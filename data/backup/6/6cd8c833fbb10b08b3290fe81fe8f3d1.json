  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the ancient hill fort at Penycloddiau in the Clwydian Range. The route uses sections of the Offa's Dyke Path and the Clwydian Way to create a circular route to the summit. You can start the walk from the Coed Llangwyfan & Penycloddiau Car Park located just to the south east of the hill. From here you can pick up the waymarked Offa's Dyke Path and follow it north west up to the hill. Here you'll find the one of the largest Iron Age hillforts in Wales. From the elevated position of the fort there are some splendid views over the Vale of Clwyd. The route then continues north west towards Aifft where you can pick up the epic Clwydian Way. The trail can then be followed south along a bridle path towards Langwyfan. Here you turn east to follow a woodland trail back to the car park.",
