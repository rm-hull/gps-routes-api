  "description": "This park is run by the National Trust and has a number of splendid walking trails to enjoy. There are panoramic views of the western Weald and a riverside stroll along the River Mole. There are also excellent facilities with the Box Tree cafe and shop which sells local produce. Box Hill is located just north of Dorking in Surrey. This circular walk visits some of the highlights of the park including the popular Stepping Stones, Broadwood's Tower and lovely woodland of the Happy Valley. The walk starts from the visitor centre near to Box Hill Fort. This scheduled ancient monument is a relic from the 1890s, when a chain of such sites were built to defend London in case of invasion by France\u00a0or Russia. Follow the waymarked trails south and then west past the Swiss Cottage, the former home of John Logie Baird, the inventor of television. One of his earliest transmissions was from the top of Box Hill. After passing the cottage you pick up a riverside trail along the River Mole. This will pass the stepping stones which are a popular beauty spot in the park. The walk then heads east to explore the Happy Valley area of the park. Here you'll find a series of nice woodland trails with some moderate climbs to Flint Hill. There's lovely views of the Surrey Hills from the high points which climb to a height of over 500ft. This includes the Salomons memorial viewpoint which is probably the most well known spot in the park, attracting almost 1 million visitors each year. It's named after Leopold Salomons, who gave 230 acres of Box Hill land to the National Trust in 1914. The views over the lush green fields, rolling hills and expansive woodland below are simply wonderful. Atfer taking in the views the walk descends back to the car park and visitor centre where you can enjoy refreshments at the cafe. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could follow the North Downs Way a few miles west to Ranmore Common . Here you will find miles of great walking and cycling trails through woodland and open download with great views of the Surrey Hills. Just to the east of the park you'll find Headley Heath . It's easily walkable from the car park and contains attractive heathland with yellow gorse, bluebell woods and purple heathers in the warmer months. You're also very close to Westhumble where you can visit Norbury Park . There's woodland, chalk grassland and farmland to explore here. Our Dorking Circular Walk starts from the town and visits the park and the nearby Denbies Hillside .",
