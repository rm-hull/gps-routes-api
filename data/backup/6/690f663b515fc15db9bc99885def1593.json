  "description": "This Cumbrian village sits on the west coast of the county in the Allerdale district. There's a wide expanse of beach, some beautiful countryside and miles of walking trails to follow around the Solway Coast AONB. This walk from the village takes you north to Silloth along a section of the Cumbria Coastal Way and the Allerdale Ramble. It's about a 7.5 mile walk along a fairly flat part of the waymarked trail. On the way you will pass Beckfoot, Mawbray and Bitterlees Bank with some fine views over the Solway Firth and Allonby Bay to the mountains of Scotland. You can extend the walk by continuing north to visit the scenic Gurne Point and Skinburness.",

Notably the authors Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins stayed there in 1857. Dickens described The Ship as \"a capital little homely inn looking out upon the sea...a clean nice place in a rough wild country\". You can find them on the Main Street at postcode CA15 6QF for your sat navs. The inn is dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."
