  "description": "This walk visits Loch Lee and then climbs to the stunning Falls of Unich and the Falls of Damff. The walk starts at the parking area at Invermark and follows a footpath along the Water of Lee to the loch, passing the 18th century Invermark Castle on the way. The path continues along the northern end of the Loch before climbing through the beautiful Glen Lee to the Falls of Unich and the Falls of Damff. It's a stunning area with wonderful views of Glen Esk and the surrounding hills and mountains. Towards the eastern end of the loch you can pick up the Mount Keen Walk. From the summit there are fabulous views back down to the loch.",
