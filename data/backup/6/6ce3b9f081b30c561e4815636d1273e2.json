  "description": "This attractive Lancsahire village is located in a scenic spot within the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It's a splendid spot with picturesque stone cottages, a lovely picnic area, two excellent pubs and the pretty Barley Water running through the village. It's a fine place to start a walk with a series of local reservoirs and the Pendle Way long distance trail running through the area. This circular walk from the village makes use of the trail to climb to the viewpoint at Pendle Hill before visiting Ogden Reservoirs. The walk then returns to the village where there's an optional extension to Black Moss Reservoir. You can start the walk from the car park and picnic area near Barley Green. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Barley. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
