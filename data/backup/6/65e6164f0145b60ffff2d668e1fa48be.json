The country pub is housed in a Grade II listed building dating back to 1650. It was originally call \u2019the Old Red Lion,\u2019 but was later renamed after Sir John Houblon, one of the main landowners in the area and the first governor of the Bank of England. Houblon used to appear on the \u00a350 note until that version was withdrawn in 2014. There's a charming old interior with several original features including oak beams and stone walls.
