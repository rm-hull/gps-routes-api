  "description": "This north Somerset based town has lots of opportunities for walkers with coast, country, woodland, hill climbs and a nearby historic house to explore on foot. This circular walk from the town visits some of the local highlights including Dial Hill, the National Trust's Clevedon Court , the neighbouring village of Walton in Gordano and the Clevedon coast. The route makes use of the Gordano Round , a circular footpath running from Clevedon to Portishead. The walk starts at High Cliff, just north of the pier on the sea front. From here you can pick up the waymarked Gordano Round and follow the waymarked footpath east up to Dial Hill where there's a nice viewpoint and a trig point. You continue east to Strawberry Hill and the Swiss Valley Cave before coming to Clevedon Court. There's miles of woodland and attractive parkland surrounding the historic 14th century manor house. After exploring the grounds the route rejoins the Gordano Round and heads through the woods to Norton's Woods. Here you can pick up the Walton Drove and follow it to Walton in Gordano. From the village it is a short walk down to the coast at Pigeon House Bay and Culver Cliff. You can then follow the coast path south to St Margaret's Bay and Ladye Sands before returning to the pier in Clevedon.",
