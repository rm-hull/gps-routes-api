  "description": "Bexhill-on-Sea is a pleasant seaside town located in East Sussex. The town includes some fine Edwardian and Victorian architecture, while for walkers there are nice coastal trails along the promenade and a fine local park to explore. Bexhill is also notable as the Birthplace of British Motor Racing as it was the location for the first motor race in the United Kingdom, in May 1902. This walk from Bexhill visits the town's Egerton Park before heading west along the coast to Cooden Beach. The walk starts on the promenade in Bexhill and heads west to visit the lovely Egerton Park. Here there's a boating lake, waterways and a model yacht lake as well. After exploring the park you return to the sea front and head west along the shingle beach to Cooden Rocks. There's another shingle beach here which is popular with kite surfers and windsurfers. The walk can be extended by continuing west to visit Norman's Bay, the site where the Norman army landed in 1066 before the Battle of Hastings. Just beyond that is the historic Pevensey Castle where they army stayed before proceeding to the battle.",
