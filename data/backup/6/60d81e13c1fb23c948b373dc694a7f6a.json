  "description": "Cautley Spout is England's highest (cascade) waterfall above ground. It's located near Sedburgh in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. This walk starts at the Cross Keys public house and follows a footpath running alongside the waterfall from Low Haygarth to the top of the spout. It is a steep climb but the footpath is essentially a series of steps so it is quite an easy path to the follow. This is likely to be a very peaceful walk as the area does not attract too many visitors. Ideal if you are looking for some solitude in beautiful surroundings. You could continue your walk by climbing further over the beautiful Howgill Fells where there are magnificent views of the Lake District. Just to the west you will find the highest point of the Howgills at The Calf. You can extend your walk by heading to this great viewpoint and then following the Dales High Way to Sedbergh. If you also use the Pennine Journey long distance trail you can turn it into a longer circular walk.",
