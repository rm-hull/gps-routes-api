  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this 3500 acre forest near Exeter. The cycling trails are well laid out and colour coded according to difficulty. There is a nice easy trail named the 'Discovery Trail' which is well surfaced and great for families looking for a safe ride or for walkers looking for a pleasant stroll. It has fun features for children and takes in some stunning views over Exeter and Dartmoor. The blue Challenge trail is a moderate mountain bike trail with a combination of surfaces, some narrow sections and gentle gradients for intermediate cyclists. More experienced riders can try the red graded 'Ridge Ride Trail' which is a technical, fast and flowing trail with tight corners and lively descents to test your reflexes. Bike hire is available from Forest Cycle Hire. Walkers can enjoy a number of waymarked trails of varying lengths and difficulty. The Butterfly Trail is a three mile circular walk with views across the forest and over the Teign valley. There's also the Mamhead Sensory Trail, an easy 1.5 miles trail with breathtaking views over the Exe estuary to the Jurassic Coast. The Raptor Trail and Tree Trail offer more challenging walks with some steep climbs. Haldon Forest Park is located about 6 miles south west of Exeter town centre. At the northern end of the forest you will find Haldon Belvedere (Lawrence Castle). The site is used as wedding venue but is also open to the public on certain days. The fine looking castle dates from 1788 and is surrounded by some the lovely grounds and gardens. See the Doddiscombsleigh Walk for more details.",
