  "description": "This Cheshire based village has some nice riverside trails and a local country park to visit. This walk takes you along the Dane Valley Way to the nearby Swettenham Meadows Nature Reserve and the Brereton Heath Local Nature Reserve . The walk starts on the river to the north of the village. Here you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it east, passing Hermitage Bridge, the Grade II listed Twemlow Viaduct, Bowshot Wood and Greenhey Wood before coming to the village of Swettenham . Near here you'll pass the Swettenham Meadows Nature Reserve on the Swettenham\u00a0Brook. It's an important site for flora and fauna with Common spotted orchid\u00a0and\u00a0marsh orchid\u00a0thriving in the wet flushes of the variable grassland.\u00a0In the warmer months it's also great for butterflies with species including\u00a0small skipper,\u00a0common blue,\u00a0small copper\u00a0and\u00a0orange tip\u00a0butterflies. You then head south, passing Davenport Hall before arriving at Brereton Heath. The nature reserve is a lovely place for a stroll with woodland trails, a lake and lots of wildlife to look out for. After exploring the reserve the route returns to the village on the same paths.",
