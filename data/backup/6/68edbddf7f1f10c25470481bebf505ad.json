    "description": "This circular walk climbs to the lovely viewpoint at Stinchcombe Hill in the Cotswolds. The hill is located just to the west of Dursley so you could start your walk from there and follow the Cotswold Way to the hill. This circular walk, however, starts from the car park about half a mile east of the hill. You follow the Cotswold Way to the hill summit where you will find a topograph displaying all the landmarks you can see from the peak. It's a lovely view with the Tyndale Monument and the village of North Nibley visible across the attractive countryside and woodland below. You can also see the Vale of the River Severn and Forest of Dean from the 219 metres (719 ft) Drakestone Point. The public footpaths pass Stinchcombe golf course so please keep to the signposted paths only. After descending back to the car park you have the option of extending your walk along the Cotswold Way. You can follow it through the series of woods on the outskirts of Dursley. This includes Sheep Path Woods, Cockshott Woods and Hermitage Woods. If you continue south along the path you can visit the Tynedale Monument view point and the town of Wotton-under-Edge .",

The historic site is owned by English Heritage and is all that survives of the former Cistercian abbey. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cotswolds Walks page."
