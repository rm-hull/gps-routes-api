  "description": "Enjoy a walk through this large forest and around the pretty village of Harwood Dale on this circular route in the North York Moors. You can start your walk from the village and then head north to reach the forest. There's lots of footpaths and bridleways to explore the coniferous woodland with its pine and spruce trees, streams and ponds. Look out for wildlife including roe deer, badgers, squirrels, foxes and various woodland birds. After visiting the forest it's well worth exploring the area around the village. If you head west you can visit the old church and enjoy a stroll along Harwood Dale Beck and Hagg Wood. Just to the south you'll find Broxa Forest, while continuing west will take you past the River Derwent into Langdale Forest. Here you'll find more good walking paths, mountain bike trails and great views over the North York Moors.",
