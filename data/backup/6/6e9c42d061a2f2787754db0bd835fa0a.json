  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this country park set within the Afan Forest. The Glyncorrwg Ponds are a series of small, beatiful lakes set along a narrow valley. You can follow a number of way-marked walks which run past the ponds, along the River Corrwg and through the surrounding hills and woodland. The walks are of varying difficulty with some gentle waterside strolls and more strenuous hill climbing. With the latter you are rewarded with fabulous views of the Afan Valley, the Gower Peninsular, the Brecon Beacons and Somerset. Cyclists will find a world class centre for mountain bikers. There is a technical singletrack route to challenge you plus miles of comfortable family cycling trails. The circular route below takes you past the ponds and along the River Corrwg before returning to the start point through peaceful woodland trails. You can find more details about all the different walks and cycle rides at the visitor centre. If you would like to extend your outing you could head deeper into the fabulous Afan Forest Park Country Park where you will find more mountain bike tracks and walking trails.",
