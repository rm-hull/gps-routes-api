  "description": "This West Lancashire based market town is in a good spot for exploring some fairly flat countryside. The town itself is a pleasant place for a walk with conservation areas, a regular market, three local parks and a church which dates back to the 15th century. Ormskirk is famous for its Gingerbread which became part of the town's retail history with several local bakers claiming to have the original recipe for the sweet treat. This walk from the town visits two of the highlights of the area at the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and Martin Mere Nature Reserve. The walk starts in the town and then follows Asmall Lane and public footpaths west to link up with the canal near Pinfold. From here you head east, passing the pretty Marina at Scarisbrick, Hurlston Green and Heaton's Bridge. The route then turns north and then east, following country lanes and footpaths to Martin Mere. The wildlife reserve includes several lakes with many varieties of bird to see. To extend the walk you could head a little to the north east to visit Mere Sands Wood Nature Reserve and the historic Rufford Hall which is run by the National Trust. To return to Ormskirk you could retrace your steps or head into nearby Burscough and catch the train back.",
