  "description": "This large mixed woodland forest near Bodmin is very popular with walkers and cyclists. There are a number of way-marked walking and cycling routes of varying length and difficulty. Walkers can explore the forest on 4 different colour coded trails. For cyclists there are three mountain bike trails. The Bodmin Beast is of moderate difficulty but has enough challenges for experienced mountain bikers. The two other red grade trails are more challenging with steeper descents. Bike hire is available at the start of the routes. Highlights in the forest include a section along the pretty Cardinham Water and the old Wheal Glynn Mine. There is also the excellent Woods Cafe where you can refresh yourself after your exercise.",
