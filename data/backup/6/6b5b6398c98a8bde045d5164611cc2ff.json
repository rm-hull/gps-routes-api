  "description": "This National Trust owned hill is one of the high points of Surrey and a great place to stretch your legs. The area is covered with attractive heathland and woodland with fantastic views from the hill top. The woodland includes oak,\u00a0rowan,\u00a0birch\u00a0and\u00a0pine with birds such as\u00a0Nightingales, siskin and brambling to look out for on the way. This walk starts at the National Trust car park and follows the Octavia Hill trail up to the 179\u00a0m (587\u00a0ft) summit. Here you will find a stone seat memorial to Octavia Hill , one of the founders of the National Trust. You can stop and enjoy the wonderful views towards the South Downs and the nearby Black Down . After taking in the views you descend on different paths to the car park. You can easily extend your walk by continuing south from Hydon's Ball to the Greensand Way which runs through nearby Hambledon. You could also visit the splendid Winkworth Arboretum from the same car park. Follow the footpaths north east through Busbridge Woods and the Juniper Valley for just over a mile and you will arrive at the arboretum. The woods have good footpaths, landscaped lakes and over 1,000 different shrubs and trees. Our Hambledon Walk starts from the nearby village and visits both the heath and the arboretum.",
