  "description": "This large area of ancient woodland consists of hundreds of acres of walking trails, a variety of wildlife and the pretty Powdermill Reservoir . There's a circular waymarked trail and a number other permissive footpaths to follow through the 262 hectares (647 acres). It's a lovely place for a peaceful stroll with heathland, coppice, ghyll woodland, broadleaf woodland, ponds, springs and streams to enjoy. You can start your walk from the car park off Chitcombe Rd at the northern end of the woods. The site is great for wildlife enthusiasts with glow worms, great crested newts, lampreys, dormouse, badgers and fallow deer to look out for. Also keep your eyes peeled for birds including woodcock, nightingales and buzzards. The attractive woodland includes conifers, spruces, oak, Hornbeam and sweet chestnut coppice. Also look out for bluebells and wood anemones in the spring months. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head south to Battle and pick up the 1066 Country Walk . The long distance trail will take you through the nearby Battle Great Wood where there are more nice trails to try. A few miles to the west you will find Vinehall Forest and beyond that the pretty Darwell Reservoir . Here you can enjoy footpaths through Darwell Wood with views across the water.",
