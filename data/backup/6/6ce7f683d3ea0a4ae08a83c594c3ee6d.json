  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Thanet Coastal Path from Whitstable to Margate. The route runs for a distance of just over 15 miles along a fairly flat, waymarked footpath. As such it's possible to complete in a day for those with a good level of fitness. The walk starts from Whitstable and heads east to Swalecliffe and Herne Bay. Here you'll find an award winning shingle beach, Victorian bandstand and gardens, and the world's first freestanding purpose-built Clock Tower, built in 1837. The route then continues to Reculver where you'll skirt the edge of Reculver Country Park. Here you'll pass the noteworthy Reculver Towers. They are an important local landmark and are listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The next stage takes you past Minnis Bay to Birchington. Minnis Bay is a family beach with attractions such as sailing, windsurfing, a paddling pool and coastal walking routes. Its three smaller beaches are surrounded by chalk cliffs, cliff stacks and caves. The village of Birchington has a nice promenade and lies on the coast facing the North Sea, east of the Thames Estuary. The final section then runs past Epple Bay, Westgate Bay, St Mildred's Bay and Westbrook Bay before coming into Margate.",

Founded to celebrate JMW Turner\u2019s connection to Margate in 2001, the David Chipperfield designed gallery opened in 2011. There's a rolling programme of temporary exhibitions and wide windows showcasing the views that inspired painter J. M. W. Turner. The artist went to school in Margate, and visited the town throughout his life. The gallery also houses a nice cafe which is a good spot for refreshments after your exercise."
