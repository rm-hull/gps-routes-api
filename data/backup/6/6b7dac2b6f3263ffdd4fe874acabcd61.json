  "description": "The town of Alfreton is located in the Amber Valley\u00a0district of\u00a0Derbyshire. There's some nice woodland and country trails to the west of the town and a local reservoir which is great for wildlife watching. This circular walk from the town visits Alfreton Park, Shaw Wood, Pentrich village and the Oakerthorpe Nature Reserve. There's attractive parkland, peaceful woodland trails and countryside views to enjoy on the way. The walk starts on the western edge of the town where you can pick up footpaths on the northern side of Alfreton Park. These will take you west to Oakerthorpe before heading south west past the golf course to St David's Hill in Shaw Wood. In the springtime this area is covered with carpets of bluebells. The route then heads south east past the site of a Roman Fortlet to the village of Pentrich. The village includes a noteworthy Norman church with a tower dating back to the 14th century. After exploring the village the route then heads north east back through the Oakerthorpe Nature Reserve. This\u00a0Local Nature Reserve has  a short circular trail  with a pond dipping platform provided for school groups. The pond platform is an ideal location to spot frogs, toads and common newts. Footpaths will then take you back to Alfreton Park where you can follow footpaths through the park back to the start point.",
