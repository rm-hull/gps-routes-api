She tricked him into diving in to the lough, and when he surfaced his blonde hair had turned completely white. Legend has it that the same fate will befall any person who swims in the waters today."

  "description": "This walk climbs to Slieve Gullion the highest point in County Armagh. It's the short route to the summit, approaching from the western side. You can start the walk from the car park at the Slieve Gullion Viewing Platform on Longfield Road. Then follow a winding footpath east to the summit which stands at a height of 573 metres (1,880 ft). At the top you can enjoy far reaching views to Antrim, Dublin Bay and Wicklow. There's also a small lake and two ancient burial cairns to see here. There's also a waymarked trail from the northern side of the mountain. To extend the walk you could follow it north to visit Calliagh Berras Lough, the highest lough in Northern Ireland. The mountain is part of the wider Ring of Gullion Ring of Gullion where there is a fantastic loop walk which runs for nearly 10 miles across the geologically fascinating heather moorland.",
