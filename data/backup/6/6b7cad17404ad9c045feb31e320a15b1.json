      "content": "Fairy Tree Trail Information:The park includes this lovely walking trail through the woodland area.The initiative was developed in partnership with Fingal County Council and is accessible free of charge. The trail, interspersed throughout the wooded area of the walled garden, provides an opportunity for visitors to discover the various tree species at Ardgillan. Informational panels along the trail offer insights into the diverse tree species found in the park. A corresponding map and quiz enhance the experience and can be accessed via the link below or at the reception in Ardgillan Castle. An exciting aspect of the trail is the possibility of spotting a fairy nestled within the enchanting trees! The team plans to expand the Fairy Tree Trail, creating an enchanting woodland area to attract more fairies to Ardgillan. Balbriggan Men\u2019s Shed has crafted homes for all the new fairy residents! The trail is open throughout the year in the park. Castle History and Detail:Originally named Prospect House, the central part of the castle was constructed by Robert Taylor in 1738, with the west and east wings being added in the late 1800s. Ardgillan Castle is also home to a permanent exhibition of 17th-century Down Survey maps of Ireland, created by chief examiner Thomas Taylor, Robert\u2019s grandfather. Besides the castle itself, the estate includes a Walled Garden and a vibrant Rose Garden. The Walled Garden was initially a Victorian kitchen garden, providing food and cut flowers for the house. A notable feature within the garden is the impressive Alcove Wall, a freestanding structure with twenty alcoves, originally built for cultivating tender fruit trees and believed to have been commissioned by the Taylor Family as a Famine relief project. Today, the estate serves as a magnificent attraction for visitors, offering various amenities such as castle and garden tours, theatre events, afternoon tea, a caf\u00e9, a fairy trail and a children's playground."
