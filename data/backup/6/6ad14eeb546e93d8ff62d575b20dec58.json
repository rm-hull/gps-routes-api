  "description": "This walk visits the ancient Finchale Abbey in Framwellgate Moor, County Durham. The English Heritage owned site dates back to the 13th-century and is designated as a Grade I listed building. Today you can enjoy a pleasant stroll along the River Wear and around the extensive remaining ruins. After exploring the ruins you can cross the footbridge and enjoy a walk around the riverside woodland on the eastern bank. The Weardale Way passes right by the abbey. You could pick up the waymarked trail and follow it south into the city of Durham to extend the walk. Here you could visit the famous cathedral and pick up the Durham Riverside Walk along the River Wear.",
