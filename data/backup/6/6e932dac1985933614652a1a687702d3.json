The north wall not only receives the most sunlight but appears to have a heated wall, as evidenced by the chimneys."

  "description": "Explore the 770 acres of woodland and parkland surrounding this 14th century moated castle near Tunbridge Wells. The gardens are stunning with rhododendrons and azaleas and the ruins of the Old Castle at the centre. The new house was built in the 19th century and overlooks the castle. It has grand rooms with fine furniture and paintings. After explorling the gardens you can follows miles of footpaths into the wider estate. You will pass woodland, ponds and also cross the River Bewl which flows through the grounds. If you would like to continue your outing you could head to the nearby Bewl Water where you will find a circular walking route around a large reservoir. The Sussex Border Path also runs just to the south of Scotney Castle and can be easily picked up.",
