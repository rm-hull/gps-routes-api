  "description": "This Worcestershire based village is located in a pleasant rural spot in the Malvern Hills area of the county. It's an attractive place with a pretty village green, a pond, a 17th century pub and lots of country footpaths branching out for its centre. This circular walk from the village takes you to the trig point to the north before heading to the neighbouring village of Hanley Castle. Here you can see the site of the ancient castle and enjoy a view of the River Severn which runs to the east of the settlements. The walk starts in the village and first follows footpaths north to the hill and trig point above the settlement. There's some nice country trails and views to enjoy from here. You then head east and south through the countryside to visit Hanley Castle. There's the site of the old castle and moat here and the option to visit the River Severn as well. To the south of here you can head to Upton Upon Severn and pick up the long distance Severn Way if you would like to extend the walk. There's some pleasant riverside sections to enjoy here. This route heads west passing along the old dismantled railway through Brotheridge Green to Gilvers Lane. Here you turn north to follow footpaths back to the village.",
