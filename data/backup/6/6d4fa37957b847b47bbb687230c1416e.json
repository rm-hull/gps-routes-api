  "description": "This attractive Hampshire based town has some lovely walks along the two rivers which flow through the area. There's also some lovely Hampshire countryside and woodland to explore around the town. This route from the town makes use of the Wayfarer's Walk and the Kings Way to create a circular walk around the town. The walk starts just to the east of the train station where you can pick up the Wayfarer's Walk and follow the waymarked path south to Tichborne Down. You continue south east past the Alresford golf course to the River Itchen, just north of Cheriton. Here you can see the noteworthy 13th century church, some picturesque thatched cottages and the site of the Battle of Cheriton which took place as part of the English Civil War in 1544. You could also take a detour here and head south to visit the splendid Hinton Ampner where you'll find the source of the Itchen and some attractive parkland. This walk heads north west to the villages of Tichborne and Ovington where you cross the river to reach Itchen Stoke. From here you head north along a country lane towards Folly Hill where you can pick up the Oxdrove Way and the Wayfarer's Walk. Follow the trails south east to the northern tip of Alresford where you can pick up riverside paths along the River Alre. These will take you east and then south to return to the town centre and train station area.",
