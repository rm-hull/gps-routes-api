During that time a small makeshift wooden jetty is erected for embarkation. When tides a too low then the company uses a World War Two DUKW to ferry the passengers out to the boat. Allchorns has been in business for 140 years and was one of the first and now last of the pleasure cruise businesses running from the beach. Cruises tend to go past Beachy Head. Beyond the beach is the facade of the Burlington Hotel built in the early 1850s and one of the family names of the Duke of Devonshire on whose land the resort was developed."

  "description": "A coastal walk from the seaside town of Eastbourne to the highest chalk cliffs in England. The route makes use of the South Downs Way and Wealdway long distance trails to create a waymarked circular route. It's about a 3 mile walk from the town up to the headland and a fairly challenging climb, with an elevation of around 500ft. As such a reasonable level of fitness is required for the walk. The route starts on the pier in Eastbourne and passes along the attractive beach to Holywell. You then climb towards the highest chalk sea cliff in Britain, at Beachy Head. The cliffs rise to a height of 162 metres (531 ft) with fabulous views along the coast to West Sussex. The route passes along the coast, before following inland footpaths back down to the town. To extend your walk you can continue west from Beachy Head to Birling Gap and the Belle Tout Lighthouse.",
