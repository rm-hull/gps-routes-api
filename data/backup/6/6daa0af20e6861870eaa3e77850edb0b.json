On the very fringe of the village of Loxwood, and adjacent to the B2133, this pub's good fortune is that it is also adjacent to a restored section of the Wey & Arun Canal. Boat trips start from here and as a result this pub can be very busy at weekends. Visitors to the canal should pass through the pub's own car park, and then they will find the canal trust's car park, which also gets incredibly busy. The pub is named after the Earls of Onslow, who used to be prominent local landowners. As a result there are at least two other pubs with a similar name, all within a few miles of each other."

  "description": "A circular walk along an idyllic section of the Wey & Arun Canal on the Surrey/West Sussex border. It's a particularly delightful area with pretty locks, old bridges, an aqueduct and views of the River Lox, which runs alongside the canal. The walk starts in the little village of Loxwood, in the Chichester district of West Sussex. Head east along the towpath and you will soon come to the lovely Brewhurst Lock and Bridge. The next section takes you to Drungewick Aqueduct, another photogenic spot on the route. It's surrounded by some beautiful West Sussex countryside and a special place in the summer months. The route then heads south down Drungewick Lane, before heading through the woodland and countryside to the south of the canal. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments in the Onslow Arms with its lovely beer garden overlooking the canal. The route uses a section of the long distance Wey South Path. You can extend your exercise by heading north along the path to Sydney Wood. Heading south takes you to Billingshurst .",
