  "description": "Explore this fabulous coastal forest in Anglesey on this walking route in Wales. There are miles of cycling and walking trails through the peaceful woodland leading you to the stunning Llanddwyn Bay and Newborough Warren Nature Reserve. This large dune, mudflat, saltmarsh and beach system attracts a large lumber of coastal birds including oystercatchers, lapwings, curlew, skylarks and meadow pipits. This circular walk starts from the Newborough Warren car park near to the coast (postcode for sat navs:LL61 6SG). It runs for about 8 miles on a series of good footpaths. The forest is attached to the wonderful Llanddwyn Island. The island has nice footpaths leading to the ruins of St Dwynwen's Church and the Twr Mawr lighthouse. From the island there are wonderful views of the Menai Strait to Snowdonia and the Lleyn Peninsula. Most of this route is designed for walkers but there are plenty of cycle tracks in the area to try as well. The Anglesey Coast Path runs past the site so you could pick this trail up and continue your exercise. Heading east will take you along the Menai Strait to Menai Bridge. Heading north will take you along Malltreath Sands to Malltraeth .",

This area of common land is one of the finest dune systems in the country. There's also an ancient pub here right next to the superb beach which is worth some investigation. The Lon Las Cefni Cycle Route starts from the forest. You could follow the trail north to Malltreath and then north east along the Afon Cefni to visit Cefni Reservoir. Much of the route is traffic free so also suitable for walkers."
