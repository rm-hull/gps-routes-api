  "description": "This walk explores the area around the National Trust's Greys Court in Henley-on-Thames , Oxfordshire. The estate surrounds a 16th century mansion and is a lovely place for a stroll with peaceful woodland trails, beautiful gardens, a turf maze, a photogenic Chinese Bridge and a 19th\u00a0century ice house to see. Other notable highlights include the Great Tower from the 14th century and a rare Tudor donkey wheel, in use until the early 20th century. The walk starts from the car park at the site and heads east towards Park Cottage before turning west to Earl's Wood. The route then loops round to Shepherd's Green before following more woodland trails back to the car park. It's a fairly gentle walk with a small climb on the way.",
