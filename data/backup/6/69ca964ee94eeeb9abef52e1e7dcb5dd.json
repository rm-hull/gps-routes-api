She dedicated her life to improving urban housing and protecting green spaces, and the impact of her efforts is still evident today. Hill's belief in the importance of access to nature for human wellbeing and her advocacy against the destruction of the natural landscape are perhaps even more relevant in today's world."

      "caption": "Toy's Hill Viewpoint. Octavia became a fervent advocate for open spaces for urban populations. Her initial involvement in the campaign to save Swiss Cottage Fields, although unsuccessful, led her to meet Robert Hunter, the solicitor for the Commons Preservation Society. Together, they successfully campaigned against development on several notable sites in London, including Parliament Hill Fields, Vauxhall Park, and Hilly Fields.  Their collaboration, along with Hardwicke Rawnsley, culminated in the founding of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in 1895. For the remaining 17 years of her life until her death in 1912, Octavia continued her dedication to countryside preservation. She played a pivotal role in helping the National Trust acquire and protect its initial properties and campaigned vigorously for the preservation of footpaths to ensure public access to natural spaces."

She chose to be buried in Holy Trinity Church rather than Westminster Abbey, and her grave can be found under the yew tree near the porch. Inside the church, there is a stone memorial dedicated to her life, as well as the Octavia Hill memorial window. This window illustrates the stark contrast between the hardships of urban life and the benefits of country life, which Octavia believed should be accessible to everyone."
