Scrapes are shallow ponds less than 1 metre deep which ideally hold water seasonally and remain damp for much of the year. They are shallow depressions with gently sloping edges which create water features in fields. They support high densities of insects and earthworms which are important food for birds and amphibians, and a diverse range of plants which benefit water voles and dragonflies."

  "description": "This village in Dorset is located near Wareham and the county town of Dorchester. It's a pretty place with a fine local pub and views of the river Win, which runs through the village. This circular walk from the village takes you north to visit the Tadnoll Nature Reserve and the Winfrith Heath Nature Reserve. Both these reserves are great places for a stroll with miles of paths and lots of wildlife to see. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north to Drove Hill and the Tadnoll Nature Reserve. The route heads across the reserve to enter the adjacent Winfrith Heath. Here you can enjoy a climb to Whitcombe Hill. Follow the trails south through Whitcombe Vale and you will come to Blacknoll Hill where there are some fine views over the area.  From here you descend south into neighbouring East Knighton where there are some pretty thatched dwellings to see. From here it is a short walk back to Winfrith Newburgh. At the western end of the Tadnoll Reserve you can pick up the Jubilee Trail. You could follow the trail north to. Moreton Manor House and Gardens. There's a lovely 5 acre walled garden to explore here. Beyond that are the woodland trails at Bryants Puddle Heath, the village of Bere Regis and Clouds Hill, the former home of T. E. Lawrence a.k.a Lawrence of Arabia.",
