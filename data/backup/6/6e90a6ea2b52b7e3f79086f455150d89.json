  "description": "This walk climbs to the  2379 feet (or 725 m) summit of Fan Gyhirych mountain in the Fforest Fawr section of the Brecon Beacons National Park. There are splendid views over the surrounding area and of Cray Reservoir below. The area is great for walkers as the entire hill is open country giving you the freedom to roam at will. The walk can be extended by continuing east to the nearby Fan Nedd.",
