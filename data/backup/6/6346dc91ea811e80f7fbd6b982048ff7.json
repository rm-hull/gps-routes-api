  "description": "Climb to the summit of Snowdon on this challenging walk in the Snowdonia National Park. Snowdon is the highest mountain in Wales, standing at a height of 1,085 metres (3,560 ft). The Pyg Track is one of six paths to the Snowdon summit. It is generally regarded as the most challenging as it crosses some rough and rocky terrain. The walk begins in the Pen y Pass car park and ascends to Bwlch y Moch. You continue past the beautiful glacial lakes of Llyn Llydaw and Glaslyn on your way to Bwlch Glas where you can see the tracks of the Snowdon Mountain Railway. The final section takes you from Bwlch Glas to the summit where there are magnificent views over Snowdonia, Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Peak District and the Lake District. The Snowdon Miners Track also starts from the same car park and has the advantage of waterside sections along the mountain's three beautiful lakes of Llyn Teyrn, Llyn Llydaw and Glaslyn. There's also the Snowdon Ranger Path, Snowdon Llanberis Path and the Snowdon Rhyd Ddu Path to try. For an exhilarating circular ridge walk, taking in the Crib Goch ridge, try the Snowdon Horseshoe .",
