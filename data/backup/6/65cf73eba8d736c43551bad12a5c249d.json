  "description": "This long circular walk around Skipton makes use of the Leeds Liverpool Canal and the long distance Dales High Way to take you on a tour of the area. It's a varied route with some easy waterside walking followed by a challenging hill climb on the southern edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales countryside. Starting in Skipton the route first heads west along the canal towpath toward Gargrave. Just before you reach the village you turn north to Ray Bridge Hill and the village of Flasby. This section passes Eshton Bridge with nice views of the pretty Eshton and Flasby Becks. The next section climbs towards Flasby Fell and then on to the notable Sharp Haw Fell which rises to a height of 357 metres (1,171 ft). From here there are terrific views over the canal, the Aire valley, Gargrave, Skipton, Wharfedale and Malhamdale. The bridleway across the fell is also great for cyclists. After taking in the views you descend to Tarn Moor before returning to the town. The final section takes you past the medieval Skipton Castle and along the canal to the finish point. To extend the walk you can explore the grounds of the castle and Skipton Woods where there are nice trails along the Eller Beck. To the south east of the town you can enjoy a climb up onto Skipton Moor where there are wonderful views over the Yorkshire Dales from 373 metre high point. In Gargrave you can try our circular walk and link up with the Pennine Way long distance trail.",
