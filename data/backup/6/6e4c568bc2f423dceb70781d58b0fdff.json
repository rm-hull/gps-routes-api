  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir in Cardiff. The site includes a nice waterside path along Llanishen Reservoir with views of the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir. The reservoirs are located on the northern outskirts of the city. You can reach them on public transport by catching a train to Llanishen train station which is located about a quarter of a mile east of the site. Here you can pick up a footpath running for just over a mile around the water. The area additionally includes the Nant Fawr Meadows nature reserve where there is a mixture of woodland and open meadows. Just to the south of the water you will find Roath Park. It's a nice place to extend the walk with wild gardens and a large lake to see. Not far from here is the River Taff where you can pick up the popular Taff Trail .",
