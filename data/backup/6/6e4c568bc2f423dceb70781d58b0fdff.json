  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir in Cardiff. The site includes a nice waterside path along Llanishen Reservoir with views of the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir. The reservoirs are located on the northern outskirts of the city. You can reach them on public transport by catching a train to Llanishen train station which is located about a quarter of a mile east of the site. Here you can pick up a footpath running for just over a mile around the water. The area additionally includes the Nant Fawr Meadows nature reserve where there is a mixture of woodland and open meadows. Just to the south of the water you will find Roath Park. It's a nice place to extend the walk with wild gardens and a large lake to see. Not far from here is the River Taff where you can pick up the popular Taff Trail .",

      "content": "Dogs are restricted to the visitor centre and car park only and are not permitted anywhere else on the site, including the paths. Lisvane & Llanishen Reservoirs know that this will be disappointing news to many nearby residents who would like to walk their dogs but they have to take seriously any threat to its designation as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) for the rare waxcap fungi. Natural Resources Wales has advised that the risk from dogs to the fungi is too great. Waxcaps are very sensitive to changes in habitat such as fluctuations in soil moisture, temperature and nitrate levels which can reduce the production of fruiting bodies. In particular, sudden changes to nitrate levels on the site \u2013 from dog urine specifically \u2013 can have a detrimental effect on the fungi. Please note that the restrictions are not applicable to assistance dogs."

      "content": "The reservoir is one of the reservoirs constructed as part of the Taff Fawr scheme for supplying water to Cardiff and was completed in 1886. It forms part of the Nant Fawr Corridor from the top of Roath Park to the countryside beyond Cyncoed. Forest Farm Country Park and the Glamorganshire Canal are good options for continuing your walking around Cardiff. The park includes some pleasant waterside cycling and walking trails including along the now disused canal."
