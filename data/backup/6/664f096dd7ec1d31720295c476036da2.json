The quarry floor now houses a large caravan park and the car park for Buxton Country Park and Grin Low."

  "description": "This circular walk climbs to a splendid viewpoint and folly in Buxton Country Park in Derbyshire. The distinctive Grade II listed Victorian folly is located atop the summit of Grin Low hill at the south eastern corner of the park. You can start the walk from the car park just off the Grin Low Road and then follow footpaths east to the tower. Here you can climb to the top of the folly and enjoy some wonderful views over Buxton to the surrounding Peak District hills. After taking in the views you can descend on alternative paths to turn it into a short circular walk. On the route you will pass other interesting features including the old Grin Low Quarry and Lime Kilns. Part of the route uses a section of the Dane Valley Way, a waymarked long distance trail you can use to extend your outing. Following it west would take you onto Axe Edge Moor where you can climb to Cheeks Hill and visit the ancient packhorse bridge at Three Shires Head. In the park you could also visit the atmospheric Poole's Cavern where you can explore the splendid underground limestone caverns.",
