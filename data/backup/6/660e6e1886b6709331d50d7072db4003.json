The woodlands surrounding the reservoir are dominated by native species such as oak, ash, beech, and willow. Along the riverbanks and wetter areas, you can find alder and birch, which thrive in these conditions. During spring and summer, the woodlands and meadows come alive with wildflowers such as bluebells, cow parsley, and meadowsweet. In the wetland areas, plants like reedmace (bulrush), yellow iris, and marsh marigold are common. Sphagnum mosses, ferns, and sedges are also widespread near the reservoir margins, contributing to its rich ecosystem. The open grasslands around the reservoir and in the River Blithe Valley feature plants such as buttercups, clovers, and oxeye daisies, providing colour and important nectar sources for pollinators. In summer, purple loosestrife and common knapweed flourish, attracting bees and butterflies."

      "caption": "The dam. The dam at Blithfield Reservoir was constructed between 1953 and 1958 to impound the waters of the River Blithe and supply clean drinking water to Staffordshire and the surrounding areas. Built as an earth-fill embankment dam, it uses compacted clay and soil to create a strong, watertight structure. The reservoir covers approximately 790 acres and can hold up to 4 billion gallons of water. An engineered spillway ensures excess water flows safely over the dam during heavy rainfall, preventing flooding and maintaining its stability. The dam blends seamlessly into the surrounding landscape, offering picturesque views of the reservoir and woodlands. Over time, the reservoir and its environment have developed into a haven for wildlife, supporting a diverse range of birds, mammals, and aquatic species. Visitors can enjoy the peaceful setting while appreciating the dam\u2019s important role in water supply and its contribution to local biodiversity."

It supports a variety of species throughout the year, including overwintering wildfowl such as wigeon, teal, tufted ducks, and goldeneye. In autumn and winter, large flocks of goosanders and pintails can often be seen on the water. Migratory birds like swallows, sand martins, and house martins visit during spring and summer, and ospreys occasionally stop to fish while passing through on migration. Wading birds such as lapwings, curlews, and common sandpipers are regularly spotted in the shallower margins. Raptors, including buzzards, kestrels, and occasionally peregrine falcons, patrol the skies, while sparrowhawks and hobbies can also be seen hunting smaller birds and insects."

The waters of the River Blithe and the reservoir itself are home to fish species like pike, roach, and perch, which in turn attract birds like grey herons and kingfishers. Otters are also known to inhabit the River Blithe, though sightings are rare due to their elusive nature. Insect life around the reservoir is abundant, with dragonflies and damselflies frequently seen near water in warmer months. Species such as the emperor dragonfly and azure damselfly are common. Butterflies, including peacocks, red admirals, and gatekeepers, thrive in the surrounding meadows and woodland clearings. Mammals like roe deer, badgers, foxes, and smaller creatures like hedgehogs and wood mice inhabit the woodlands and grasslands. Bats, including pipistrelles and Daubenton's bats, can often be spotted in the evening, feeding on insects near the water\u2019s edge."

  "description": "This large reservoir in the Blithe Valley has three nice colour coded walking trails to try. The blue route shown below starts from the free car park towards the northern end of the lake. It's a short circular walk taking you through the broadleaf and coniferous woodland. The route is accessible and includes a bird hide where you can look out for a wide variety of birds. There are also two longer walks to try. The red route includes woodland trails, reservoir views and a boardwalk through wetland with various interesting plants and wildflowers to look out for. The yellow route is the longest and takes you through a wildflower meadow and Stansley Wood where there are bluebells in the spring. Another nice walk along the reservoir can be found at Watery Lane on the eastern side of the water just below the B5013. This takes you right along the water and is suitable for cyclists. You can see all the three routes marked out on the open street view map link below. The Staffordshire Way runs past the southern end of the reservoir so there is scope for continuing your walk along this long distance path. If you follow it west you can pick up the Trent and Mersey Canal and head to Shugborough Park near Great Haywood and Little Haywood. Here you will find the 900 acre Shugborough Estate with its mansion house and delightful gardens.",

Here you'll find a few nice pubs where you can enjoy refreshments after your exercise. The Crown is a good choice with a friendly atmosphere and a good menu. In the winter you'll find a nice cosy fire indoors while outside there's a nice garden area for warmer days. You can find it in the Market Place with a postcode of WS15 3BS for your sat navs."

To the north west there's the village of Sandon where you can explore the old Sandon Hall estate. There's nice views of the Trent Valley from the public footpaths surrounding the expansive hall estate which is occasionally open to the public. There's also nice walks along the Trent and Mersey canal in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
