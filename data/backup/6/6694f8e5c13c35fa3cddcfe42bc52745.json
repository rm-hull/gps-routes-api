  "description": "This walk explores Pow Hill Country Park and the expansive Derwent Reservoir in County Durham. The park has some lovely waterside trails with splendid views across the reservoir. There's also a small woodland area with picnic tables. The walk starts in Pow Hill at the car park. You can explore the park before following a footpath south east to the dam. Then cross the impressive dam and follow the tracks round to Cronkley before finishing at the Millshield picnic area. The reservoir is one of the biggest inland waters in England, stretching for 3.5 miles (5.6 km) and covering an area of 4 km\u00b2. Along the trail you can look out for a wide variety of pretty wildflowers. There's attractive heathland with pretty heather, foxgloves and dog violet. You can also see lots of wildlife on the water including Great crested grebes and crossbill. Keep your eyes peeled for red squirrels in the conifer plantation of Pow Hill. To extend your walking in the area head west and visit Blanchland. The delightful village is full of picturesque cottages, set against a backdrop of deep woods and open moors. There's a lovely waterside trail along the River Derwent to follow here. You can also pick up the long distance Weardale Way in the village. Cyclists can enjoy a splendid circular route around the water on our Derwent Reservoir Cycle Route. Just to the north west you will find the expansive Slalely Forest. There's miles of nice wide walking trails and mountain bike trails here.",
