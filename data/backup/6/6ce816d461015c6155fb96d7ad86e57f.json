  "description": "A long circular walk around the Surrey Hills town of Dorking, making use of some of the fine waymarked trails which run through the area. You'll follow sections of the Mole Gap Trail, the North Downs Way and the Greensand Way to take you on a walking tour of the surrounding countryside. There's some splendid North Downs scenery and a visit to the popular Box Hill Country Park to enjoy. The walk starts in the town centre at the beginning of the Mole Gap Trail. The path leads north through the lovely Denbies Hillside. The National Trust run area includes waymarked trails, woodland paths and great views of Leith Hill and Dorking from the high points. On your left you'll also pass the Denbies Wine Estate which contains the largest vineyard in England, representing more than 10 per cent of the plantings in the whole of the United Kingdom. Near Westhumble the route picks up the North Downs Way and heads east towards Box Hill Country Park. The park has miles of woodland paths and nice riverside trails along the River Mole where you can find the picturesque stepping stones. There's also the Box Tree cafe and fine views over the Weald to enjoy here. You continue along the path towards Betchworth, turning south at Brockham Hills. The footpaths will take you to the village of Brockham where there's a pretty village green and nice views of the River Mole which flows west through the village. Here you pick up the Greensand Way and follow it west back into Dorking. There's lots of great options for extending your walking in the Dorking area. You could head south to Holmwood Common where there's 650 acres of ancient woodland, grassland and ponds to explore. Just to the west of Denbies Hillside you will find miles of trails in the expansive Ranmore Common and the 1400 acre Polesden Lacey estate. A few miles to the south east of the town you can climb to the highest point in the south east at Leith Hill .",
