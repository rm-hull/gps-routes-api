He expressed this wish in 'A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells Volume 7: The Western Fells' and in his memoirs: \"All I ask for, at the end, is a last long resting place by the side of Innominate Tarn, on Haystacks, where the water gently laps the gravelly shore and the heather blooms and Pillar and Gable keep unfailing watch. A quiet place, a lonely place. I shall go to it, for the last time, and be carried: someone who knew me in life will take me and empty me out of a little box and leave me there alone. And if you, dear reader, should get a bit of grit in your boot as you are crossing Haystacks in the years to come, please treat it with respect. It might be me.\" ~ Alfred Wainwright - from \"Memoirs of a Fellwalker\" (1990)"

  "description": "Although not one of the highest of the Lake District fells at (597 m, 1,958 ft), Haystacks was one of Alfred Wainright's favourites. So much so that he chose to have his ashes scattered near the summit. The walk begins at the car park at the south eastern end of Buttermere and starts by crossing Peggy's Bridge. You then cross Buttermere Fell, ascending to Scarth Gap and then to the summit. The view is magnificent with Gable Crag on Great Gable and the western panorama of Ennerdale Water and High Crag. Crummock Water and Buttermere are also visible. The walk then heads past the lovely Innominate Tarn, a popular beauty spot with an indented rocky shore and a line of tiny islets. Shortly after you come to Blackbeck Tarn, a long slender pool which overflows through a cleft in the crags. You continue the descent through Warnscale Bottom with views of Warnscale Beck and a series of pretty waterfalls to enjoy. If you'd like to continue your walking then a stroll around the nearby Ennerdale Forest and Buttermere Lake are always enjoyable.",

The historic site is notable as the last working slate mine in England and dates back to 1728.
