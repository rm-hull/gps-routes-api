Happisburgh Lighthouse was built in 1790; it is the oldest working light in East Anglia, and the only independently run lighthouse in Great Britain. Two lighthouses were built after 70 sailing ships and 600 men were lost during a severe winter storm in 1789 - Low Light was situated on the cliftop but has since tumbled into the sea, and High Light, located 400 yards inland from it, which still stands. Its tower is 85ft tall and the lantern is 134ft above sea level. The Low Light was discontinued in 1883; the pair formed leading lights marking safe passage around the southern end of the treacherous Haisborogh Sands."

A walk along the clifftop path from Eccles on Sea to the village of Happisburgh, a short distance further to the northwest, provides evidence of coastal erosion; this stretch of coastline is called Low Light and it is unprotected from wave action. On the beach below outcrops of clay can be seen that have, so far, withstood the power of the waves. It won't take long before they too are being smoothed over and washed away.\nAfter the devastating floods in 1953, where 300 people lost their lives, the first sea defences were built and later extended, using greenheart and jarrah wood, combined with steel, for the groynes and revetments."

The earliest mention of the Walcott family in northeast Norfolk is in East Hall. William de Edgefield's (1154 to 1189) mother, Maud de Walcott, granted two parts of the tithe of her lands in Walcott to the monks of Broomholm Priory in Bacton. In 1240 and possibly 1281, Thomas de Walcott held part of the advowson (income) of Walcott church and was lord of West Hall. The house depicted above appears to be the farmhouse."

  "description": "This pretty little village is located in a lovely spot on the Norfolk coast. It's a delightful place with a sandy secluded beach, a striking 18th century lighthouse and a historic 15th century church to see. The village also became archaeologically significant in 2010 when flint tools over 800,000 years old were unearthed. This is notable as the oldest evidence of human occupation anywhere in the UK. This circular walk from the village takes you along the coast to neighbouring Walcott before returning on inland footpaths. It's a flat, easy walk with lovely coast and country views throughout. The walk starts from Happisburgh Lighthouse before heading to the coastal path. You follow this north west along the beach to the village of Walcott . It's a nice cliff top path though you will notice the coastal erosion in this area. The route then leaves the coast and returns to Happisburgh on an inland public footpath passing Church Farm and St Mary's Church on the way.",
