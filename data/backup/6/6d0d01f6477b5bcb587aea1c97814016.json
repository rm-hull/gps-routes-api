The two caissons today are supported by hydraulic rams rather than the previous ropes and pulleys on the earlier structure. This picture shows the far caisson raised where the hydraulic ram is difficult to discern from the \"A\" frame supports. One of the many interesting facts related by the tour guide was that Messieur Citroen developed the distinct chevron gearing, the shape of which later became the symbol of cars bearing his name. It was a triumph of Victorian engineering when first constructed."
