  "description": "This 120 acre country park is situated on the River Garw just north of Bridgend. There are lovely woodland trails with mature sweet chestnuts, ancient oaks and towering beeches. Look out for foxes, squirrels and wood peckers as you make your way through this section of the park. The park also has large areas of grassland with wildflower meadows and space where children can run and play. The formal gardens include tranquil oriental style garden with rhododendrons, magnolia, azaleas, an ornamental bridge and tea house. You can also enjoy riverside trails along the Garw where you can look out for otters, dippers and kingfishers. Herons can be seen around the lovely ornamental lake. On the eastern side of the park you can pick up the Garw Valley Railway Path. The shared cycling and walking path starts in the park and heads north along a disused railway line to Blaengarw. To further extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Bridgend Circular Walk. The long distance trail explores the countryside around the town, passing close to the splendid Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes which are also well worth a visit.",
