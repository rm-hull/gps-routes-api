  "description": "This attractive Norfolk village includes a pretty pond, picturesque cottages, a village green and a fine old church. This walk from the village follows a section of the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path National Trail to one of the historic local highlights at Castle Acre Priory. The walk starts in the village and heads south west to link up with the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path around Massingham Heath. Follow the waymarked trail south for just over 4 miles and it will take you to Wicken Fen and Castle Acre. Here you can visit the castle and priory which date from the 11th century. You can also enjoy a waterside walk along the River Nar on the Nar Valley Way, another long distance trail running through this part of the county.",
