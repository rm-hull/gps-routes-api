  "description": "Enjoy a little walk along the shores of the lovely Loch Oire in Elgin, Moray. The pretty loch is located just to the east of Lhanbryde. It's a great place for a peaceful stroll with lots of wildlife to see on the water. You can park your car in the small lay-by on the eastern side of the loch at Threapland to start yourself off. The walk can be extended by following a trail south east through the woods to the nearby Loch na Bo.",
