  "description": "This walk climbs to Mynydd Bodafon on the eastern side of the Isle of Anglesey. The hill is notable as the highest point on the island of Anglesey. However, the highest in the county of Anglesey is Holyhead Mountain. You can start the walk from the parking area, just south west of the hill. Then pick up a circular trail which will lead you up to the 178 metre summit. At the top you are rewarded with some splendid views across the island to the coast. To the south west there's also Llyn Bodafon to visit.",

Benllech to Moelfre Coastal Path will take you along a section of the popular Anglesey Coast Path which runs through the area. To the north west there's the worthy town of Amlwch. The coastal town is well worth exploring with a visit to the Copper Kingdom visitor centre in Port Almwch recommended. Here you can learn all about the history of Amlwch's 18th century \u201cCopper Rush\u201d in a series of interesting exhibitions. The splendid Amlwch Walk will take you along the coast to the historic lighthouse and viewpoint at Point Lynas. To the west there's also the beautiful neighbouring village of Bull Bay, the most northerly village in Wales. On the southern edge of the lovely Red Wharf Bay, is the Pentraeth Forest where you can enjoy peaceful woodland trails, climb to Mynydd Llwydiarth and look out for the resident red squirrels. For more walking ideas in the area see the Anglesey Walks page."
