  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Falling Foss waterfall in the North York Moors. The picturesque falls are a major highlight of the National Park. The walk starts in the parking area located near the falls and heads through wonderful ancient woodland to the 30ft high falls. Along the way there is a waterside section along the pretty May Beck. There's also lots of little paddling pools and other smaller waterfalls dotted along the walk. Also on the route is the delightful Falling Foss tea rooms which are the perfect place to stop for refreshments. This is a fairly easy walk with a few small climbs and generally good footpaths. If you're looking to extend your walking in the area then you could head to the 70 ft high Mallyan Spout Waterfall and enjoy more woodland trails. The Beck Hole Thomason Foss Waterfall is also located in this area. The pretty little village and its smaller falls are worthy of a visit too.",

The little tea rooms are located at Midge Hall, a tiny cottage which nestles at the top of the falls. They have a good range of meals and snacks with an outdoor seating area overlooking the waterfall."

      "content": "The epic Wainwright's Coast to Coast walk passes the falls so you may bump into walkers on this long distance trail. To extend your walk you could pick up the trail and follow it north west to Grosmont. Here you can pick up the Grosmont to Goathland Rail Trail and the Grosmont to Whitby Walk. There's also a train station here on the North York Moors Steam Railway, another popular attraction of the area. For more walking ideas in the area see the North York Moors Walks page."
