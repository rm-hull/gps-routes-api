  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Falling Foss waterfall in the North York Moors. The picturesque falls are a major highlight of the National Park. The walk starts in the parking area located near the falls and heads through wonderful ancient woodland to the 30ft high falls. Along the way there is a waterside section along the pretty May Beck. There's also lots of little paddling pools and other smaller waterfalls dotted along the walk. Also on the route is the delightful Falling Foss tea rooms which are the perfect place to stop for refreshments. This is a fairly easy walk with a few small climbs and generally good footpaths. If you're looking to extend your walking in the area then you could head to the 70 ft high Mallyan Spout Waterfall and enjoy more woodland trails. The Beck Hole Thomason Foss Waterfall is also located in this area. The pretty little village and its smaller falls are worthy of a visit too.",
