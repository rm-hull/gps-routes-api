On this sunny August bank holiday weekend the beach was busy, most of the visitors are at the far end of the beach nearer the cafe and steps up to the National Trust car park. The public toilets at the cove are discreetly tucked away behind the cafe, under a turf roof with a drystone wall. They have won an award for their environment-friendliness - all the waste is digested in a system beneath the lavatories and very clean effluent is discharged into the stream after being UV treated."

The RNLI lifeboat is launched from the boathouse down the slipway into the sea - and in fact had done so just a few minutes earlier. The cliff railway connects the boathouse to the crew station, although the visiting public is invited to use the steps. The lifeboat station was opened here in 1961, the location was chosen because it was sufficiently protected to allow safe launching in all conditions. The old lifeboat station around the Lizard headland at Polpeor Cove was too exposed, making launching difficult and dangerous in certain conditions."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Lizard Point to Kynance Cove and then visits the Lizard National Nature Reserve and the little village of Cadgwith on the Cornish Coast. There's some truly spectacular coastal scenery with stunning coves, beautiful beaches, turquoise seas and imposing cliffs. You start off at the Lizard Point car park and head around Lizard Point, the most southerly place in Britain. It's a beautiful and unique area with interesting geological formations and a variety of flora and fauna. The walk continues north to Kynance Cove via Crane Ledges and Pentreath Beach. Kynance Cove has spectacular cliffs, stacks, arches and islands of serpentine rock while the beach is considered one the most beautiful in the world. The area is also covered with attractive heathland and a variety of rare coastal plants. From Kynance Cove you head inland across the Lizard National Nature Reserve and Lizard Downs to Cadgwith. The tiny fishing village is very picturesque with thatched cottages and a pretty stream trickling over the sand and shingle beach. At Cadgwith you pick up the coast path again to take you back to the car park. On this final section you pass interesting geological features such as Whale Rock and the Devil's Frying Pan. The latter was formed from the collapsed roof of a sea cave with a remaining arch of rock. The walk is also great for wildlife spotting. Look out for grey seals in the water and the Cornish Chough in the air. The walk can be extended by continuing along the South West Coast Path to Mullion Cove, north of Kynance Cove. The cove is another feature of this lovely section of coast with its pretty harbour and surrounding cliffs. See the Mullion Cove to Lizard Point Walk for more details.",
