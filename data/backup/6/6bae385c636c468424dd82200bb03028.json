      "content": "One of the must see buildings on the route is Britain's oldest pub at the Porch House in Stow on the Wold. The inn has an interesting history dating all the way back to the 10th century when it was thought to have been a hospice built on on land belonging to Evesham Abbey. The interior has bags of old character with wonky ceilings and a very fine 16th century fireplace. They do excellent food and also provide accommodation if you need to stay over. There's also an outdoor area for finer days. You can find the historic inn on Digbeth Street with a postcode of GL54 1BN for your sat navs. It's also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."
