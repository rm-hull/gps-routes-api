These were generally flood-meadows (here it is the River Soar) which remained as open fields. Strips would be allocated to farmers who would be entitled to the hay crop, harvested around Lammas tide. In the case of the Loughborough Meadow, this was subsequently grazed. Strip owners had the right to graze a number of cattle proportional to the size of their strip holding, the meadow remaining unfenced. The Meadow is now a SSSI, managed by the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust, still using the traditional farming methods. An idea of the variety of meadowland flowers can be seen in this picture."

      "caption": "Loughborough Viaduct - just to the north of the town. The viaduct carried the Great Central Railway over the river Soar on a gradient of 1 in 176 (30 feet per mile). An unusual feature is the use of skew arches in the middle of the structure where it crosses the river itself. The extra arches were doubtless put in to ensure additional room for the river in flood times, as the railway is carried on an embankment on both sides of the viaduct. In the foreground is part of Loughborough Big Meadow, a so-called 'Lammas Meadow' on which ancient farming practices are still observed."

  "description": "A waterside walk from Loughborough to Leicester along a section of the Grand Union Canal and the River Soar . It's about a 13 mile route, so it's possible to do in a day. At the end of the walk you can get the train directly back to Loughborough from Leicester. The walk starts on the canal just to the east of the train station. You can access the towpath from Moor Lane Bridge and then follow it south east towards the village of Barrow upon Soar . The route continues through the lovely Soar Valley to Mountsorrel and Syston, where you pass through Watermead Country Park . It's a real highlight on the route with 12 lakes, wildflower meadows, woodland, grassland and reedbeds. Look out for a whole host of wildlife on this section of the walk. The final section takes you through Birstall and Belgrave, before finishing at Abbey Park in Leicester. It's a lovely finish to the walk with the attractive park including formal gardens, a sensory garden, a boating lake, a model boat lake, a miniature railway and pretty bridge over the River Soar.",
