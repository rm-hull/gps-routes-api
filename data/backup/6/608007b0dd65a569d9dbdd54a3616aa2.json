  "description": "This is a popular lakeside walk from Howtown to Glenridding along the Ullswater Way long distance trail. The route follows the lakeshore of the beautiful Ullswater Lake, with fabulous views to the mountains of the Helvellyn range on the south western side of the lake. It's a fairly easy walk on good paths so a great one for families or anyone looking for a less strenuous lakeland walk. You start the walk from Howtown Pier where the Ullswater Steamer boats dock. Head west to Geordie's Crag before a short woodland section through Hallinhag Wood, just below Hallin Fell. Look out for red squirrels on this pleasant woodland section. The path then heads through Sandwick, crossing the pretty Boredale Beck. You then pass Scalehow Wood and Scalehow Waterfall before coming to Birk Fell and Silver Point. You continue south to the village of Patterdale , passing the Devil's Chimney and Blowick Bay on the way. The final section takes you over the Grisedale Beck before heading past the woodland under Raven Crag and finishing at Glenridding. To extend the walk you can continue along the Ullswater Way to the beautiful Aira Force waterfall. Here you will find lovely trails leading through ancient woodland to the spectacular 65ft high waterfall. Near the start of the route you pass Hallin Fell . You have the option here of taking a small detour and climbing the noteworthy hill. From the 388\u00a0m (1,273\u00a0ft) there are wonderful view of the lake and surrounding fells. The climb to St Sunday Crag and Grisedale Tarn starts from Patterdale. The challenging climb provides great views over the lake below.",
