  "description": "This is a popular lakeside walk from Howtown to Glenridding along the Ullswater Way long distance trail. The route follows the lakeshore of the beautiful Ullswater Lake, with fabulous views to the mountains of the Helvellyn range on the south western side of the lake. It's a fairly easy walk on good paths so a great one for families or anyone looking for a less strenuous lakeland walk. You start the walk from Howtown Pier where the Ullswater Steamer boats dock. Head west to Geordie's Crag before a short woodland section through Hallinhag Wood, just below Hallin Fell. Look out for red squirrels on this pleasant woodland section. The path then heads through Sandwick, crossing the pretty Boredale Beck. You then pass Scalehow Wood and Scalehow Waterfall before coming to Birk Fell and Silver Point. You continue south to the village of Patterdale, passing the Devil's Chimney and Blowick Bay on the way. The final section takes you over the Grisedale Beck before heading past the woodland under Raven Crag and finishing at Glenridding. To extend the walk you can continue along the Ullswater Way to the beautiful Aira Force waterfall. Here you will find lovely trails leading through ancient woodland to the spectacular 65ft high waterfall. Near the start of the route you pass Hallin Fell. You have the option here of taking a small detour and climbing the noteworthy hill. From the 388 m (1,273 ft) there are wonderful view of the lake and surrounding fells. The climb to St Sunday Crag and Grisedale Tarn starts from Patterdale. The challenging climb provides great views over the lake below.",

      "content": "We recommend stopping in Howtown at the Howtown Hotel for some refreshments on your walk. There are some delightful tea rooms situated adjacent to the Hotel, offering a separate facility for walkers and visitors to enjoy a range of delicious home-made scones, cakes, light lunches and coffees throughout the day. There's also a pretty garden area to sit out in on warmer days. You can find the hotel next to the pier with a postcode of CA10 2ND for your sat navs. In Patterdale there's the noteworthy White Lion Inn for a pit stop. The pub has an interesting history having existed since the early 1800s. It's said that Wordsworth was in the bar as news arrived that Nelson had died at Trafalgar in 1805. The interior is full of old world charm while outside there's a nice beer garden just across the road. It's a lovely place to relax and soak in the fine views if the weather is good. You can find the pub in the village at postcode CA11 0NW for your sat navs. It's also dog friendly."

The peaceful and secluded tarn is a lovely place to visit with fine views back down to Ullswater on the climb up. The climb to Bonscale Pike and Arthur's Pike starts at Howtown. They are both fine Ullswater viewpoints with the photogenic Bonscale Tower a highlight on the walk."
