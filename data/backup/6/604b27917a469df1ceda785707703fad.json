  "description": "These pretty woods in the village of Beamish have some nice woodland trails to try. There's also some waterside paths along the River Team and bluebells in springtime. This circular walk runs for about 2 miles taking you through Ousbrough Woods to Ousbrough Hill. About a mile north west of the site there's another nice woodland walk in the grounds of Beamish Hall. The 18th-century country house includes 24 acres of grounds with themed family trails at certain times of the year. Also nearby is the excellent Beamish Museum. The open-air museum is a fascinating place for a stroll with original and replica buildings, a large collection of artifacts, working vehicles and equipment, as well as livestock and costumed interpreters. The Consett and Sunderland Railway Path runs past the woods so you could pick this up to continue your walking in the area.",

On the outskirts of nearby Consett there's Allensford Country Park to explore. There's nice riverside trails, a decent cafe and a lovely waterfall on the Wharnley Burn in this popular and picturesque park. For more walking ideas in the area see the County Durham Walks page."
