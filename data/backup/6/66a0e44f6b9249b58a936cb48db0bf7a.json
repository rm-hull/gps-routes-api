  "description": "This circular walk takes you up a popular and delightful fell in the Forest of Bowland. The route runs for a distance of just under 4 miles and involves a moderate climb to the hill top. Starting in the village of Scorton you follow country lanes and footpaths to the 215m summit, passing a pretty tarn on the way. From the summit there are fabulous views of the Fylde coast, Blackpool Tower, Morecambe Bay and the Lake District fells. You descend through the lovely Grizedale, passing along Grizedale Reservoir and through peaceful woodland before returning to Scorton. To extend your walking in the area you could try our Scorton Circular Walk and follow it Wyresdale Lake. The Wyre Way long distance trail passes through the area too. You could follow the trail north and visit Scorton Lake and Wyre Lake, near the village.",

      "content": "Just to the west of the fell is the popular town of Garstang. Here you can pick up the Garstang Canal Walk and enjoy an easy stroll along the Lancaster Canal. To the east is one of the finest climbs in the Forest of Bowland at the beautiful Parlick and Fair Snape Fell. Beacon Fell Country Park lies just to the south west and has well laid out woodland trails an a very good visitor centre/cafe. Naer here there's a bit of a hidden gem at Brock Bottom. Here you'll find a scenic picnic site next to the babbling River Brock. There's nice riverside trails and old mill ruins to see in this picturesque area. Just to the south there's the delightful village of Calder Vale to visit. It's a lovely place for a stroll with views of the River Calder, a village pond, bluebells woods, and the historic Lappet Mill, an old cotton weaving mill which is still in use. For more walking ideas in the area see the Forest of Bowland Walks page."
