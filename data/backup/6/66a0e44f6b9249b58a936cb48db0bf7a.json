  "description": "This circular walk takes you up a popular and delightful fell in the Forest of Bowland. The route runs for a distance of just under 4 miles and involves a moderate climb to the hill top. Starting in the village of Scorton you follow country lanes and footpaths to the 215m summit, passing a pretty tarn on the way. From the summit there are fabulous views of the Fylde coast, Blackpool Tower, Morecambe Bay and the Lake District fells. You descend through the lovely Grizedale, passing along Grizedale Reservoir and through peaceful woodland before returning to Scorton. To extend your walking in the area you could try our Scorton Circular Walk and follow it Wyresdale Lake. The Wyre Way long distance trail passes through the area too. You could follow the trail north and visit Scorton Lake and Wyre Lake, near the village.",
