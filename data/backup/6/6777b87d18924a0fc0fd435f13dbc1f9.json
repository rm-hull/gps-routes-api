  "description": "This walk visits Buttermere Lake from the town of Keswick in the Lake District National Park. The route runs for almost 9 miles, passing Derwent Water, Catbells and Robinson fell on the way. Starting in the town the route follows the Allerdale Ramble to Catbells. The fell is one of the most popular in Lakeland with a fairly easy climb. From the summit there are fabulous views of Derwentwater, Bassenthwaite Lake, the Newlands Valley, Skiddaw and Keswick to the north, while the view south has a fine vista of Borrowdale. The route then descends west to the hamlet of Little Town in the beautiful Newlands Valley area of Lakeland. This area has been made famous as the setting for the story of Mrs Tiggy Winkle by Beatrix Potter. There's some fine scenery here with pretty becks and waterfalls. The route then turns south west to follow the Scope Beck to Robinson Fell. The fell stands at a height of 737 m (2,418 ft) providing great views over the Newlands Valley towards Derwentwater. The final section then descends from Robinson to Buttermere. Here you can enjoy a lovely circular walk around the lakeside. Buttermere has a delightful walking path running along most of the shoreline making for an idyllic waterside stroll. In the village you can reward yourself with refreshments at one of the nice pubs.",
