  "description": "This pretty little village in the East Riding of Yorkshire is a pleasant place to start a walk into the Yorkshire Wolds. The village includes a Grade I listed medieval church and is close to the highest point in the Wolds at Garrowby Hill. This walk from the village takes you through Bishop Wilton Wold to neighbouring Millington village and the pretty Millington Woods. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Minster Way and follow the waymarked footpath east to Milner Wood. You continue south past Bishop Wilton Wold to Garths End Fields and Great Givendale. Continue south east past Gildingside and The Balk and you will come to Millington village. Turn north west along a country lane and you will soon come to the woods. Here you will find the best ancient ash woods in the Yorkshire Wolds. You can also enjoy carpets of bluebells, giant bellflowers and the scent of wild garlic at certain times of the year. At the northern end of the woods there's also a splendid viewpoint over the surrounding Wolds countryside.",
