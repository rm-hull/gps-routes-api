  "description": "This walk takes you along the Great Central Walk in the Warwickshire town of Rugby. The dismantled railway line is now a nature reserve which is open to walkers and cyclists. The trail can be picked up just to the south of Rugby train station and followed for just over 3 miles to Onley Lane. Here you leave the trail to follow the country lane down to the Oxford Canal at the southern end. The area is good for wildlife spotting with a variety of butterflies and birds to see along the path. At the end of the route you can extend your walk by picking up the towpath of the canal and following it north to take you back to Rugby. See our Circular Walk Around Rugby for more details. If you head south it along the canal it will take you into Braunston. Just to the west of the walk you will find the lovely Draycote Water where there's a nice waterside footpath to follow around the lake.",
