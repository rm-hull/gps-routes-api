Grim's Dyke is most famous for its association with the librettist, Sir William Schwenck Gilbert, the writing half of the Gilbert & Sullivan partnership, who lived in the house from 1890 to his death in 1911.\nThe name Grim's Dyke comes from an ancient defensive earthwork which runs from Pinner Hill to Bentley Priory.\nThe House was built there in 1870 for the Victorian Painter Frederick Goodall, who had bought 100 acres of land at Harrow Weald in 1856 but was unable to build for 12 years until the expiry of a lease. During that time he landscaped the area and planted trees, setting aside 30 acres parallel to the ancient earthwork for the house and gardens. Work started on the house in 1870 and was completed in 1872."

Every day in the summer he would bathe there - a habit which eventually cost him his life. On 29th May 1911 Gilbert invited two local girls to swim in the lake. He died attempting to help one of them when she got into difficulties."

In the reserve you will find a variety of wildflowers such as spotted orchid. Look out for birds including\u00a0buzzard,\u00a0spotted flycatcher, and\u00a0bullfinch. You can park at the Stanmore Common car park and pick up the London Loop to the reserve. Other public footpaths will take you past the deer park and the lake. There's lots of good options for extending your walk in this area. If you head west along the London Loop you can visit Harrow Weald Common and Oxhey Woods with its splendid, easy access sculpture trail. On the common there's also the noteworthy Grim's Dyke Hotel, the formere home of Sir William Schwenck Gilbert, the writing half of the Gilbert & Sullivan musical partnership. The Stanmore Common walk also starts from the same start point as this walk.",
