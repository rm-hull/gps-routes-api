  "description": "This splendid waterside walk takes you from Tiverton in Devon to Taunton in Somerset. The first section of the walk takes you from Tiverton to Greenham along the towpath through the Grand Western Canal Country Park. At Greenham you join the West Deane Way and the walk changes as you start following the dry bed of the canal. However, the waterside aspect continues as you also join the River Tone which takes you through Bradford on Tone and then onto the finish point in Taunton. To continue your waterside walking in the Tiverton area you can pick up the Exe Valley Way which runs through the town. You could follow the riverside path south to Brampford Speke and Bickleigh where you'll find the 18th century Bickleigh Mill .",
