  "description": "This walk takes you on a tour of the beautiful Ingram River Breamish Valley in the Northumberland National Park. You'll pass along rivers and burns with miles of open moorland and the Cheviot Hills making a splendid backdrop. The walk starts at the village of Ingram and heads west along the River Breamish and the Greensidehill burn towards Brough Law and Linhope. At Hartside you turn south and head towards Alnhamoor crossing the river as you go. You continue to Little Dod before picking up Salter's Road (a track) to climb High Cantle hill. You continue east towards Linhope where you can take a short detour to visit the splendid Linhope Spout waterfall. From Linhope you soon pick up the country lane from the start of the walk which will return you to Ingram. If you'd like to continue your walks in the area then you could climb the nearby Hedgehope Hill and The Cheviot .",
