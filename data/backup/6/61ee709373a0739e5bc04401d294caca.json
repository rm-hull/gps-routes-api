  "description": "This Greater Manchester town is located near Bolton and Chorley. Local walking highlights include the climb to the excellent viewpoints at Rivington Pike and Winter Hill. The town is also very close to Rivington Country Park where there are some excellent paths along a series of large reservoirs. This walk from the town takes you east to visit the Wallsuches Reservoirs. There's some pretty lakes here with nice waterside paths and views of the surrounding countryside. The area also includes Ridgmont Park where there's a beautiful tree-lined footpath entrance, a large field and a footpath around it. A nice place for a dog walk with more fine views towards Winter Hill and North Wales. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Horwich. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
