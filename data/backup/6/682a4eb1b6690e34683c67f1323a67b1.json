Situated on the artificial mound known as the Tump, this wind-reactive sculpture by Diane Maclean was commissioned in 2006 by Ipswich Borough Council and Bellway Homes, the developers of the nearby Ravenswood housing estate, which the Tump overlooks. The twelve stainless steel columns vary in height from between 7 and 10 metres. The 'wings' of coloured stainless steel turn in the wind. The colour is created by an oxide layer on the polished surface of the material, which reacts with daylight to create colour change. The colours change with the seasons and the varying light of day."

  "description": "Enjoy fabulous views of the River Orwell in this delightful country park in Ipswich .  There are woodland walks and riverside footpaths to enjoy in over 200 acres of parkland. There's good facilities with a good sized car park where you can directly pick up the trails. The Stour and Orwell Walk also runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along the river. If you head east you can visit the splendid Trimley Marshes where there is a huge variety of water loving birdlife to look out for. You could also head north along the Suffolk Coast Path and enjoy a walk around the attractive Ipswich Docks and Marinas. You'll also pass through the adjacent Landseer and Holywell Parks.",
