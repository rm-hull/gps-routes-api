  "description": "This circular walk explores a beautiful coastal headland near Kinsale in County Cork. The walk starts from Garretstown beach and follows a series of country lanes around the headland. It's a fairly easy walk, running for about 4 miles on surfaced paths. At the southern end of the route you will visit the memorial to the crew of the RMS Lusitania. The British ocean liner was sunk close to the headland, on 7th May 1915 by a German U-boat. Around here you can also see the ruins of Downmacpatrick Castle with fabulous views down to the tip of the headland. Since the golf course opened, access to the southern end of the Old Head of Kinsale has been restricted to golfers and guests only. There has been a long-running campaign for the restoration of public access organised by the Free the Old Head of Kinsale Campaign. However there's still some wonderful sea views to enjoy from the southern end of this loop. To continue your coastal walking in Cork, head west towards Clonakilty and the Seven Heads . There's a long circular trail to follow around the peninsula with pretty seaside villages, lovely beaches and bays. To the east you will find the Ballycotton Cliff Walk . The popular cliff top trail runs from Ballycotton village to Ballyandreen along a wonderful cliff top path.",
