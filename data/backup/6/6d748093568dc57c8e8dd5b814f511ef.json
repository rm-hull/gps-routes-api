  "description": "This circular walk explores a beautiful coastal headland near Kinsale in County Cork. The walk starts from Garretstown beach and follows a series of country lanes around the headland. It's a fairly easy walk, running for about 4 miles on surfaced paths. At the southern end of the route you will visit the memorial to the crew of the RMS Lusitania. The British ocean liner was sunk close to the headland, on 7th May 1915 by a German U-boat. Around here you can also see the ruins of Downmacpatrick Castle with fabulous views down to the tip of the headland. Since the golf course opened, access to the southern end of the Old Head of Kinsale has been restricted to golfers and guests only. There has been a long-running campaign for the restoration of public access organised by the Free the Old Head of Kinsale Campaign. However there's still some wonderful sea views to enjoy from the southern end of this loop. To continue your coastal walking in Cork, head west towards Clonakilty and the Seven Heads. There's a long circular trail to follow around the peninsula with pretty seaside villages, lovely beaches and bays. To the east you will find the Ballycotton Cliff Walk. The popular cliff top trail runs from Ballycotton village to Ballyandreen along a wonderful cliff top path.",

      "content": "Just to the east there's another local highlight at Charles Fort. The National Monument of Ireland dates back to the 17th century and includes good footpaths to follow around the Bastions. There's also some excellent views over Kinsale harbour and exhibitions where you can learn all about the history of the area. A little further east there's more cliff top walking on the Crosshaven Cliff Walk. This fine circular walk provides wonderful views over Cork Harbour and visits the 16th century Camden Fort Meagher. To the north of Crosshaven there's the 13th century Blarney Castle to explore. The ancient castle is surrounded by some beautiful grounds and gardens with miles of footpaths to enjoy. Near here there's the circular Cork Marina Walk where you can enjoy fine views over the River Lee and a visit to the 16th century Blackrock Castle. To the west there's also Galley Head where you can explore the sand dunes at Long Strand beach before heading towards the 19th century lighthouse at the end of the headland."
