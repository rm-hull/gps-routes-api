  "description": "This attractive coastal town in Gwynedd has some lovely coastal walking paths and beautiful beaches to explore. This circular walk around the town takes you along waymarked coastal paths before heading inland to climb Moel y Gest for fine views over the Llyn Peninsula . The walk starts at Porthmadog Harbour and heads south along the Llyn Coastal Path and the Wales Coast Path. The trail takes you past Borth-Y-Gest to the expansive Black Rock Sands beach at Morfa Bychan . Here you can follow the path along the beach, passing the sand dunes and the cliffs. The path then leaves the cliffs and heads inland on public footpaths and country lanes toward Moel y Gest. The summit stands at a height of 263 m (863 ft), offering fine views over the Ll\u0177n Peninsula, the Rhinogydd, Moelwynion, Moel Hebog, and Snowdon. At the top you will also find a hillfort which shows some resemblance to the \"nuclear forts\" of the Early Middle Ages found in Scotland. After enjoying the views the route descends back to the coast path which you can follow back to Porthmadog. To continue your walking in the area you can try the Porthmadog to Portmeirion Walk which takes you over the estuary of the Afon Glaslyn to the picturesque Italian style village of Portmeirion . Following the Llyn Coastal Path west will take you to Criccieth where you can enjoy another nice beach and visit the ruins of Criccieth Castle.",
