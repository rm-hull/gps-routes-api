In the east stretch limestone plains where sheep and cattle graze in rich pasture and the villages are compact and picturesque. To the west are hills covered with untameable bog, and a loose chain of villages which straggles along the shore of Galway Bay. This is Iarconnaught, an important centre for the Irish language."

  "description": "This walk visits Lough Corrib in County Galway. The expansive body of water is notable as the largest lake within the Republic of Ireland. The walk begins in the town of Oughterard at the south western end of the lake. From here you can pick up a section of the long distance Western Way and follow the waymarked footpath north west. This will take you along the lough and past the Derroura Forest which lies to the south of the water. On the way there are great views across the lough to its hundreds of islands and beyond to the surrounding mountains. The route finishes at the north western end of the lake where it joins with the Belan Na Brock River and the Failmore River. To continue your walking in the area head south and try the Oughterard Wind Farm Walk. The scenic circular walk explores the expansive Galway Wind Park, Ireland's largest on shore windfarm. You could also head further south to Galway where you can pick up the Galway River Corrib Walk. The River Corrib connects the lake to the sea at Galway. At the northern end of the lake there's the wonderful Ashford Castle. The medieval/Victorian castle includes beautiful grounds, riverside trails and a popular hawk walk.",

You can also enjoy coastal walks along the pretty Rusheen Bay and Silverstrand Beach here as well. To the north there's the climb to Mount Gable where you can enjoy some wonderful views back down to the lough."
