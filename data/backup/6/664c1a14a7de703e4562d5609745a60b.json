  "description": "This Wiltshire town has some lovely waterside walking trails along the tranquil River Avon and the Kennet and Avon Canal to the south. It's also surrounded by some lovely Wiltshire countryside with plenty of waymarked footpaths to try. Melksham is conveniently located just east of Bath and not far from Bradford-on-Avon. This circular walk around the town takes you along the river to the Kennet and Avon Canal to the south of the town. The route run for just over 8 miles and includes some nice waterside and countryside sections. The walk starts in the town by the river and follows footpaths south west to the Pack Horse Bridge at Monkton Farm. The route continues south east past Whaddon before picking up the canal towpath near Semington. You can take a little detour south of the canal to visit the pretty village if you have time. Follow the towpath east towards Seend Cleeve before heading north east to Redstocks. Here you turn north west to return to Melksham through the countryside. The last section through the town follows the pretty Clackers Brook back to the river. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Melksham. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
