  "description": "Follow the St Swithun's Way from Winchester to Farnham on this historical walk through the Hampshire and Surrey countryside. The trail gives the walker the opportunity to visit numerous churches with pilgrimage connections. The walk begins at the splendid Winchester Cathedral and heads east, through the Itchen Valley towards Itchen Abbas . This opening section includes a long waterside stretch along the River Itchen, passing through the pretty village of Itchen Abbas as you go. The next section takes you from New Alresford to Alton along country lanes and through a couple of peaceful woodland stretches. You will also pass through the village of Chawton - home to Jane Austen. From Alton you head north-east, following the River Wey through Bentley, before finishing at Farnham in Surrey. Here you can enjoy a visit to Farnham Castle and Farnham Park where there's 320 acres (130 hectares) of hills, valleys, ponds and streams.",
