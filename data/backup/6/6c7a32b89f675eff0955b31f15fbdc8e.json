  "description": "This pretty Northamptonshire village has some picturesque thatched cottages, an old castle motte and splendid views of the River Nene. This walk from the village follows a section of the Nene Way to Warmington, Oundle and Barnwell Country Park. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Nene Way and follow the waymarked footpath south east to Eaglethorpe and Warmington. On the way you'll pass the remains of the old Fotheringhay Castle plus a pretty lock and weir on the river. The route continues south west past Tansor Grange before passing through Ashton where you'll cross the river at Ashton Mill. The route then heads through Oundle before finishing at Barnwell Park where there's a number of pretty lakes and a marina.",
