  "description": "The seaside town of Southport has some lovely coastal trails to try. This walk uses the Sefton Coastal Footpath and the Trans Pennine Trail to take you to some of the beautiful local nature reserves. The walk starts on the promenade next to the large marine lake. Head south along the front, passing the noteworthy pier, which is the the second longest seaside pleasure\u00a0pier\u00a0in the\u00a0British Isles. You continue past the famous Royal Birkdale golf club, which has hosted the\u00a0Open Championship\u00a0on numerous occasions. Shortly after you come to the Ainsdale Sands National Nature Reserve. There's a wonderful sand dune system here with Natterjack Toads to look out for on the way through. Look out for flora including Early-marsh Orchid, Marsh Helleborine and Grass of Parnassus. The route continues to Formby Beach where there are some huge dunes to climb. From the high points there's wonderful views towards Liverpool and the Welsh Mountains. There's also a woodland area where you can look out for red squirrels. After exploring the reserve the route turns inland to pass through the town of Formby and finish at the train station. Here you can catch a train directly back to Southport. The town is located on the Ribble Estuary which is a great place for birdwatching. Our Ribble Estuary Walk takes place in the town of Lytham on the other side of the water. There's nice views over the estuary back to Southport from here. The Marton Mere and Mere Sands Wood Nature Reserves are very near the town too. They both offer lovely nature trails with wonderful wildlife spotting opportunities.",
