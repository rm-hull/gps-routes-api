There was a quarry for gravel extraction across the road from here."

  "description": "These 800 acre woods near Milton Keynes have some good mountain bike trails and miles of footpaths. You can start your exercise from the car park where you can pick up the Longslade Trail red route. It's a single track 10km trail with flowing berms and corners, short but stiff climbs and the odd (rollable) drop-off. You can see the trails mapped out on the open street map below. You can also pick up various footpaths taking you across Wavenden Heath and Bow Brickhill Woods. There's nice shady woodland paths, pretty ponds and lots of wildlife to see. Look out for Muntjac Deer, Fallow Deer, rabbits, hares and various woodland birds. The Milton Keynes Boundary Walk passes through woods so you can pick up the trail to extend your walk. If you follow the trail north it will take you through the countryside to Woburn Sands and Salford. Heading south will take you through Buttermilk Wood to Rushmere Country Park. The Greensand Ridge Walk also passes through the woods. If you follow it east you will soon come to the splendid Woburn Park. The expansive park includes tranquil ponds, pretty Orchards, a 3000 acre deer park and the magnificent Woburn Safari Park with its White Rhino, Elephants, Tigers and Black Bears.",
