  "description": "This circular walk visits the precariously positioned Mussenden Temple in Castlerock, County Londonderry. It's a popular walk with the gardens and parkland of the historic Downhill House and some outstanding cliff top views to enjoy. Start the walk from the Downhill House car park. From here you can pick up trails heading towards the ruined 18th-century mansion. Follow a footpath north from the house and it will take you to the coast and the temple which is perched on the cliff top. From the elevated spot there are some glorious views over the Inishowen Peninsula. Sadly, due to coastal erosion the historic tower is moving ever closer to the sea and required stabilisation work from the National Trust in 1997.",

The spectacular causeway is one of the highlights of the country and well known around the world. The Portballintrae to Ballintoy Coastal Walk passes the site on a popular section of the Causeway Coast. A little further east there's also Carrick-a-Rede. To the south west you'll find Limavady and the lovely Roe Valley Country Park. The park includes an ornamental lake and waterside paths along the River Roe. To the west is the climb to Binevenagh Mountain. The area is a designated AONB and includes a pretty lake, impressive geological features and wonderful hill top views."
