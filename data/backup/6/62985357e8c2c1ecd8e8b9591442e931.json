A number of public footpaths traverse the site."

  "description": "Enjoy a short waterside stroll along the North Walsham and Dilham Canal on this easy Norfolk walk. The disused canal has a lovely footpath running from North Pigney's Wood nature reserve along the canal. Start the walk from the Pigney's Wood car park just off Hall Lane. It's located just to the north east of North Walsham town centre. From here you can pick up some nice woodland trails taking you through the woods to the canal. Follow the canalside footpath down to Bacton Road before returning on the same path. The nature reserve includes some nice features including wetland areas, carpets of bluebells in spring and a 450-year-old ancient oak tree. It's also great for wildlife with goldcrest, nuthatch, Cetti\u2019s Warbler, dragonflies, butterflies, otter, water vole and badger to look out for. The Paston Way long distance trail runs through North Walsham to Pigney's Wood. You could start the walk from the town and follow the waymarked trail to the site. There's also the Weavers' Way which you can pick up in the town and follow south east towards Honing Bridge. Here you'll find another nice footpath along the canal, running towards Dilham. To extend your walk follow the Paston Way to Bacton on the Norfolk Coast. You could also visit Bacton Woods which is located just to the east of the town. The attractive woods have 30 species of tree, including Scots and Corsian Pine, Western Hemlock, Douglas Fir and Larch.",
