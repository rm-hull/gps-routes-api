  "description": "A circular walk around the Lancashire town of Garstang, taking in the Lancaster Canal , Greenhalgh Castle and the River Wyre. It's a lovely area with waterside trails and great views towards the countryside and hills of the Forest of Bowland AONB. Starting at the High Street car park in the centre of town head east to the River Wyre where you can follow a footpath south to the canal. Follow the canal east before picking up countryside trails towards the ruins of Greenhalgh Castle. Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby\u00a0had the castle built in 1490 to provide defence for his estates around\u00a0Garstang. After passing the castle the route returns to the river where a short stroll takes you back to the car park. There's several good options for extending your walking in the Garstang area. You could pick up the Forest of Bowland Walk and enjoy a long circular route around this stunning area. Part of this route uses a section of the Wyre Way long distance trail. Following the trail south will take you towards Churchtown and St Michael's on Wyre. You could also continue along the Lancaster Canal towpath. Following it north will take you to Galgate, while following it south takes you towards Bilsborrow and Preston. At Bilsborrow you'll find the impressive Owd Nell's/Guy's Thatched Hamlet complex. The canalside 'village' includes a pub, restaurant, hotel and ice cream parlour.",
