  "description": "This town in Angus is famous as the birthplace for playwright\u00a0J. M. Barrie where you can see a statue of\u00a0Peter Pan\u00a0in the town square. The town is in a great spot for walkers too, near to the Cairngorms National Park and a scenic local loch. This walk from the town takes you west along the Garie Burn to visit the RSPB's Loch of Kinnordy Nature Reserve. You can start off in the town centre where you can pick up a footpath heading north west along the Garie Burn past Kirriemuir\u00a0Den park and Court Hillock. You continue west for about a mile to visit the Loch of Kinnordy. There's lots of wildlife to see here with osprey, buzzard, otters, red squirrels, deer and various wildfowl on the water.",
