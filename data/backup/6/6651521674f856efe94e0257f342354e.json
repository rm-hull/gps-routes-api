  "description": "This town in Angus is famous as the birthplace for playwright J. M. Barrie where you can see a statue of Peter Pan in the town square. The town is in a great spot for walkers too, near to the Cairngorms National Park and a scenic local loch. This walk from the town takes you west along the Garie Burn to visit the RSPB's Loch of Kinnordy Nature Reserve. You can start off in the town centre where you can pick up a footpath heading north west along the Garie Burn past Kirriemuir Den park and Court Hillock. You continue west for about a mile to visit the Loch of Kinnordy. There's lots of wildlife to see here with osprey, buzzard, otters, red squirrels, deer and various wildfowl on the water.",

      "content": "To continue your walking around Kirriemuir head north east from the burn to climb to the Hill of Kirriemuir where you can visit the Camera Obscura. The camera was donated by J. M. Barrie and offers views to the south and south-west and of the higher hills to the north. Also on the hill and offering views from its southern slopes is the town cemetery, where Barrie is buried in the family grave. See the video below for more details. You could also head east into Forfar and visit the splendid Forfar Loch Country Park. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
