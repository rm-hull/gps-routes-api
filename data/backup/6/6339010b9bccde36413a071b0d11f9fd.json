  "description": "Visit this wonderful country park and enjoy fabulous views over Northern Ireland on this circular walk in Belfast. On a clear day you can see as far as the Isle of Man and Scotland from the high points. This walk starts at the Belfast Castle car park. The fine 19th century Scottish baronial castle sits in an elevated position at 400 feet (120 m) above sea level with fine views over the city below. The grounds of the castle are very attractive with wide lawns and pretty gardens to enjoy before the climb. After heading through the castle estate you start the challenging climb up to the 370 metres (1200 ft) high hill. On the way you will pass the three large man made caves and interesting geological formations including 'Napoleon's Nose'; a basaltic outcrop which resembles the profile of the famous emperor Napoleon. At the summit you will find McArt's Fort and stunning views of the Mourne Mountains, Scrabo Tower and Slieve Croob . You can descend the same way or follow more footpaths across the hill to turn it into a longer circular walk. At the end of your descent you can enjoy refreshments at the Belfast Castle restaurant and learn about the history of the area in the visitor centre. On the other side of Belfast Harbour you can visit Redburn Country Park for more nice walking trails and another great viewpoint. You can virtually explore the park's trails using the google street view link below!",
