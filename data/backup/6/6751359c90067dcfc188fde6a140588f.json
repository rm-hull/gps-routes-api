  "description": "This Cornish town is located a few miles south of the coast near Redruth. Local walking highlights include the climb to Carn Brea where you'll find an ancient hillfort and some fine views over the town. In this area you can also pick up the popular Great Flat Lode Trail. The circular cycling and walking route explores Cornwall's heritage mines, exposing you to Camborne's rich copper mining history. To the north there's the splendid Tehidy Country Park where you'll find some peaceful woodland trails and lots of wildlife. Near here there's also the coast where you can pick up the South West Coast Path National Trail and visit to Godrevy Head and the beaches at Portreath. This walk from the town follows footpaths up to the ancient hill fort at Carn Brea. Here you will find the Basset Monument and some excellent views over the surrounding coast and countryside.",
