  "description": "This circular walk explores Haddon Hill in the Brompton Regis area of Somerset. The hill sits in a lovely spot on Exmoor close to the expansive Wimbleball Lake. The walk starts from the Haddon Hill car park which lies just to the east of the hill. From here you can pick up a footpath heading west to take you to the summit viewpoint. Here you will find a trig point standing at 1,164 feet (355 m) above sea level. From this elevated spot there are excellent views across the adjacent lake towards Dartmoor. The hill is also covered in lovely heather during the late summer months with lots of birdlife and butterflies to look out for too. After taking in the views the route descends to the north towards Hartford where you can pick up a lakeside trail running along the southern edge of Wimbleball Lake. Follow the trail east and it will take you past a woodland area toward Bridge End. The route then turns west to follow paths back to the car park.",
