Remodelling has since occurred, notably by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1895. Terrace and garden were designed by Gertrude Jekyll. Today's landscaped front garden is styled on an Elizabethan knot garden. The farm house has had famous 20th Century owners, notably creator of neighbouring Winkworth Arboretum, Dr Wilfrid Fox, and wildlife artist & conservationist, David Shepherd. Extensive grounds surround the farm. The farm name could come from Richard de Wynkworthe of Hascombe Manor, in the 14th Century."

  "description": "Enjoy a series of woodland walking trails in this beautiful arboretum in Godalming. The area is run by the National Trust so there are very good facilities including a free car park and a tea room. In the woods you will find over 1,000 different shrubs and trees with many rare species. These include magnolias, bluebells, azaleas, rhododendron and holly. There are also large landscaped garden lakes, an attractive boathouse and lovely carved benches with animal figures. There are three colour coded, waymarked trails to try:- a blue 'Access for All' walk, a yellow 'Taste of Winkworth' walk and a red 'Challenging' walk. Look out for wildlife such as herons, green woodpecker and cormorants. It's a great place to spend a peaceful afternoon, particularly in autumn when the woods look spectacular. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby River Wey Navigation and enjoy a waterside stroll along the towpath from Godalming. Just over a mile to the south west is another fine National Trust owned area. Hydon's Ball and Hydon Heath have a waymarked footoath taking you to the Octavia Hill memorial seat where there are splendid views over the Surrey Hills. You can follow footpaths from the arboretum through Busbridge Woods and the Juniper Valley to reach the site.",

      "content": "Both the Hambleden Walk and the Chiddingfold Walk visit the site from the nearby villages. They are both worth a visit with the latter including a village green, a beautiful landscaped open garden and one of the oldest pubs in England. In nearby Hascombe you can enjoy a climb to Hascombe Hill. Here you will find an ancient Iron Age Hillfort and a photogenic stone circle built by the Megalithic Order of Druids in 1995/97. For more walking ideas in the area see the Surrey Walks and the Surrey Hills Walks pages."
