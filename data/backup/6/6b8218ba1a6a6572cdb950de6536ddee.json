  "description": "This walk visits Rosebery Reservoir in the Lammermuir Hills in Gorebridge, Midlothian. There's a country lane at the northern end of the lake which you can follow towards nearby Yorkston. It's a very pretty and quiet area with lovely views over the lake to the surrounding countryside. The reservoir is also a popular fishing spot with Rainbow and Brown Trout. At the north eastern side of the lake there's the River South Esk running north towards Temple village. There's some waterfalls and fine old buildings including the Mill house and Parish Church here. It's easy to extend the walk by heading north to Edgelaw Reservoir or south to the larger Gladhouse Reservoir .",
