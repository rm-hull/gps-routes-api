Their daughter Katherine inherited the estate and married Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who built much of the house that remains today."

  "description": "This fine country house has an expansive estate to explore on a number of footpaths. This circular walk visits the woodland, lake and parkland where there's fine views of the surrounding Lincolnshire countryside. The castle is situated between Bourne and Swinstead and has been the home of the\u00a0de Eresby\u00a0family since 1516. There's 10 miles of trails with a\u00a0medieval deer park\u00a0and Tudor oak park crossed by fine avenues of trees. You can also hire bikes on the estate if you prefer to cycle. The park is home to an abundance of wildlife with Buzzards, Red Kites, Swans, and Geese to look out for in the air. There are also resident deer with types including Red, Fallow and Muntjack Deer. The gardens are also majestic with wonderful topiary and ornate statues. To extend the walk you could head west into Swinstead or east into Edenham where there's The Five Bells pub to visit. There's also some good public footpaths heading south toward Little Bytham where there's another deer park with woodland.",
