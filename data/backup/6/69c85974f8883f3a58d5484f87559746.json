  "description": "This interesting village is located in East Hampshire, near Portsmouth and Havant. It includes an unusual lung shaped village green, the remains of a motte-and-bailey castle and a 19th century church. The village is located in a lovely spot for walkers being close to the South Downs, Stansted Park, the Forest of Bere and the south coast. This loop from the town visits some of the highlights of the area including Stansted Forest, Stansted Park, Havant Thicket and Staunton Country Park. All of these locations are within walking distance of the village and provide scenic footpaths and lovely views. The walk starts from the train station, just to the east of the village centre. The station is on the Portsmouth Direct Line between London Waterloo and Portsmouth served by the generally hourly stopping service. From the station you can pick up the Monarch's Way and follow the waymarked trail east along the Avenue through Stansted Forest to Stansted Park. The expansive park is an excellent place for walkers with 1800 acres of parkland surrounding the Edwardian Stansted House. After exploring the park the route then heads back along the Sussex Border Path and then through the forest to visit Havant Thicket. The peaceful woods form part of the wider the Forest of Bere. There's a network of fine trails with woodland birds and deer to look out for on the way. From the thicket it's a short walk south into the adjacent Staunton Country Park. There's two pretty lakes and more woodland trails here. You can pick up the Staunton Way in the park and follow it north back to the village and the train station.",
