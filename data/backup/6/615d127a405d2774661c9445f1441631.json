  "description": "This circular walk from the village of Limpsfield Chart uses sections of the Vanguard Way and the Greensand Way to explore the surrounding area. On the way you will visit High Chart woodlands and Chartwell House, the historic family home of Sir Winston Churchill. There's also a visit to Crockham Hill village and Crockhamhill Common which lies just to the east of Limpsfield Chart. On the way there's miles of peaceful woodland trails and hill climbs with excellent views over the area. You can extend the walk by heading west to explore Limpsfield Common. There's more great Surrey Hills views and a community orchard to see here.",
