  "description": "This village in South Oxfordshire is in a fine location for walkers with hill climbs and large areas of woodland right next to the settlement. The local Chinnor Quarries are also a popular place for walkers with significant geological interest to be found here. The site is private but there is a public footpath running past the quarries. Several long distance trails also pass through the area including the Ridgeway National Trail. You can use these trails to explore the surrounding countryside of the Chilterns. This circular walk from the town uses a section of The Ridgeway and other public footpaths to visit some of the countryside, woods and hills to the south east of the town. On the way you'll climb to Hempton Wainhill for some fine views over the area. You'll then head to the Chinnor Hill Nature Reserve where there's interesting flora and fauna and views back down to the town. Near here the paths pass through the Oakley Hill nature reserve where you can look out for a range of butterflies around the reserve's chalk downland and beech woodland. The route then returns along the Chinnor Quarries which are a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The site has yielded many fossils of ammonites from the Lower and Middle Chalk present. You can start the walk from just north of the train station where a footpath meets with the Ridgeway.",

You can find it on Oakley Road with a postcode of OX39 4HX for your sat navs."

      "content": "The heritage Chinnor Railway runs from the village to nearby Princes Risborough. There's some lovely country views to enjoy as you travel along on the old steam train. The Icknield Way Path runs past the village. You could pick up this popular long distance trail and follow it north east to visit the neighbouring town of Princes Risborough. The market town of Thame is located just a few miles north west. In this area you can also visit the worthy village of Long Crendon. Here you'll find a number of medieval timber framed properties including Long Crendon Courthouse which dates to the 15th century and is run by the National Trust. From the village there is also a pleasant footpath to the remains of Notley Abbey, an Augustinian abbey founded in the 12th century and located in a scenic spot by the River Thame. The circular Bledlow Ridge Walk visits the hill from the neighbouring village. It's an attractive settlement which includes a fine old pub and the Yoesden Wood Nature Reserve where there's some interesting flora and fauna to observe. The circular walk from the neighbouring village of Stokenchurch visits the quarry and the Aston Rowant Nature Reserve. The reserve lies just to the south of the village and has some lovely woodland trails with wildlife such as the rare red kite to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Chilterns Walks and Oxfordshire Walks pages."
