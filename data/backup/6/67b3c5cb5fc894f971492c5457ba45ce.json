  "description": "This village in South Oxfordshire is in a fine location for walkers with hill climbs and large areas of woodland right next to the settlement. The local Chinnor Quarries are also a popular place for walkers with significant geological interest to be found here. The site is private but there is a public footpath running past the quarries. Several long distance trails also pass through the area including the Ridgeway National Trail. You can use these trails to explore the surrounding countryside of the Chilterns. This circular walk from the town uses a section of The Ridgeway and other public footpaths to visit some of the countryside, woods and hills to the south east of the town. On the way you'll climb to Hempton Wainhill for some fine views over the area. You'll then head to the Chinnor Hill Nature Reserve where there's interesting flora and fauna and views back down to the town. Near here the paths pass through the Oakley Hill nature reserve where you can look out for a range of butterflies around the reserve's chalk downland and beech woodland. The route then returns along the Chinnor Quarries which are a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The site has yielded many fossils of ammonites from the Lower and Middle Chalk present. You can start the walk from just north of the train station where a footpath meets with the Ridgeway.",
