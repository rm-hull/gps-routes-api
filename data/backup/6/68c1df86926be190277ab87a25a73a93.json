  "description": "This Torfaen county based town has a fine local park and waterside trails along the local river and canal. This walk from the town explores Pontypool Park before heading along the Lwyd to the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal . The extensive park is located in the town centre and includes some nice walking trails taking you to ponds, woodland, Italian gardens, a stone circle, streams and a ski slope. At the eastern end of the park you can stroll along the river to the canal at Pontymoel. You could extend the walk by following the canal south to visit the neighbouring town of Cwmbran where you could explore the Blaen Bran Reservoir and Community Woodland. If you follow it north it will take you to the popular Goytre Wharf where there's boat hire, an informative heritage centre and on site cafe.",
