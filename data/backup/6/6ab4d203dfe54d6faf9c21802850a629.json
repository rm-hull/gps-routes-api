  "description": "This pretty lake near Barnsley has a nice circular footpath to follow around the water. There's also sculptures, water loving wildlife and fine views across the water to enjoy. After your exercise you can enjoy some refreshments at the pleasant lakeside cafe. Cyclists can also also enjoy the path as well. You can find the lake a few miles south east of Barnsley, near the village of Darfield. To continue your walking in the area head a short distance north to explore the RSPB's Old Moor Nature Reserve. The Dearne Way also runs past the northern side of the lake. You could pick up this waymarked trail and enjoy a riverside walk west towards Old Moor and Wombwell Wood where there's some nice peaceful woodland trails to try.",
