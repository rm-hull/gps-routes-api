  "description": "This pretty riverside village is located just to the south of the famous University city of Oxford. This circular walk from the village explores the River Thames and Sandford Lock to the west of the settlement. It's a very pretty area with little islands, weirs and lovely views of the surrounding countryside. There's also a fine riverside pub to relax in after your exercise. The walk starts from the parking area at Sandford Lock and then heads north along a section of the Thames Path to Fiddler's Elbow, a small island in the river. You can then follow other paths along the pretty Sandford Pool before returning to the village. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit Harcourt Arboretum. It's a delightful place for a stroll with wildflower meadows, rhododendrons and bluebell woods to see.",
