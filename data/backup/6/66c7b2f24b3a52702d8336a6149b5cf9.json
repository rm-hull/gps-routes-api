  "description": "The area of Bradfield in the Peak District is a fine place for a walk. There's pretty villages, peaceful woodland and several lovely reservoirs to visit. The two villages are also very appealing with a medieval church, picturesque village cricket pitch and some classic old pubs to try. This circular walk visits High Bradfield, Low Bradfield, Agden Reservoir, Dale Dike Reservoir, Strines Reservoir and Damflask Reservoir. There's lots of nice waterside paths, woodland trails and moderate hill climbs to enjoy on the way. The walk starts in High Bradfield and first heads west to visit Agden Reservoir. You head along Windy Bank on the southern side of the water before turning south to visit Dale Dike Reservoir. You can follow a path along the western side of the water which will take you to Strines Reservoir. There's lovely views across the water to the surrounding Peak District hills. The route then turns north east to follow country and woodland trails through Bradfield Dale. You then follow the Dale Dike east to visit the western end of Damflask Reservoir before heading through Low Bradfield to return to High Bradfield.",
