  "description": "Follow the man made New River from Hertford to Islington on this easy waterside walk. There's much to enjoy on this walk including regular views of the River Lea and riverside Nature Reserves. The walk passes through Hoddesdon, Rye Meads RSPB Nature Reserve, Cheshunt , Enfield and Finsbury Park with urban sections towards the end of the walk. In the Hertford area the river runs parallel to the Lea Valley Walk which follows the towpath of the River Lea Navigation canal. It's a nice way of extending your walk or creating a circular route around the Hertford and Ware area.",
