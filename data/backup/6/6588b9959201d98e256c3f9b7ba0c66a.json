  "description": "Follow the man made New River from Hertford to Islington on this easy waterside walk. There's much to enjoy on this walk including regular views of the River Lea and riverside Nature Reserves. The walk passes through Hoddesdon, Rye Meads RSPB Nature Reserve, Cheshunt, Enfield and Finsbury Park with urban sections towards the end of the walk. In the Hertford area the river runs parallel to the Lea Valley Walk which follows the towpath of the River Lea Navigation canal. It's a nice way of extending your walk or creating a circular route around the Hertford and Ware area.",

There's an extensive menu and a nice outdoor seating area with good views across the park.Near here there's also the Woodberry Wetlands Nature Resere where there is an on site cafe. Built in 1538 the historic Red Lion pub is one of the oldest buildings in the area and the second oldest in Stanstead Abbotts. It started life as a monastery, then a coaching inn and was renovated in 2005 to help reinstate the character of the pub. They serve good quality food and gave a garden area. You can find them on the High Street at postcode SG12 8AA. The pub is dog friendly."

      "content": "On the route you'll pass through the lovely Woodberry Wetlands. This new nature reserve was created in 2016 and is one of the highlights on the path. There's two pretty reservoirs, a boardwalk, and a visitors' centre with a cafe. It's a great place to see several species of water loving bird such as pochard, shoveler, gadwall, grey heron, tufted duck and reed bunting. In Finsbury Park you can pick up the popular Parkland Walk. The walk follows the course of an old railway line running between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Park. The whole route is actually a local nature reserve and a great place to see interesting flora and fauna in the city. The Enfield Walk starts from the market town and uses part of the trail. It also visits the lovely Whitewebbs Park and the historic Forty Hall which is just to the west of the river, near the town. Near Ware and Stanstead Abbotts you'll pass pass the Amwell Nature Reserve. The reserve is a great place for wildlife with lots of wintering wildfowl to look out for on the two pretty lakes. It can be found at postcode SG12 8ED and is well worth taking a small detour to explore, particularly if you are keen on wildlife. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hertfordshire Walks and London Walks pages."
