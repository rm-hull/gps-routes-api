  "description": "This walk takes you from Ardaneaskan to the ruins of Strome Castle on the shores of Lochcarron. From the lochside country lanes there are splendid views over the water to the surrounding woodland and mountains. The walk passes through Leacanashie before coming to Strome Castle. The ruins overlook the loch making it a great photo opportunity. You can virtually explore this section of the loch using the google street view link below!",
