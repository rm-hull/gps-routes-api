  "description": "This is a short circular route up onto Stanage Edge from the Hollin Bank car park. Though the distance is less than 4 miles it is still quite a challenging walk with a fairly steep climb at the start. The Hollin Bank car park is located just to the south of the ridge, on the North Lees Road. From here you can pick up footpaths through the woodland of the Stanage Plantation and up onto the Long Causeway which passes along the wonderful gritstone escarpment. Follow the ridge north west and you will soon come to the high point at High Neb which stands at a height of 458 metres (1,503 ft). Here you can enjoy wonderful views over the Hallam Moors and the Hope Valley. After taking in the views you can descend on another footpath to the Long Causeway. It bends round to the south west taking you past the Buck Stone to the North Lees Road. You can then follow the country lane back to the car park to complete the walk. For a longer route which starts from Hathersage try our other Stanage Edge Walk. You could also head east and visit Stanedge Pole. The pole stands at a height of 438 metres (1,437 feet) and marks the border between Derbyshire and South Yorkshire.",
