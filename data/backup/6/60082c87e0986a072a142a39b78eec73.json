  "description": "This fascinating East Sussex town is a fine place to explore on foot. As well as its historical sites there are also fine trails into the surrounding countryside of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This walk around the town visits Battle Abbey, the site of the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The area is run by English Heritage and includes the battlefield trail and the Harold stone, which marks the spot where King Harold fell. There's also a walled garden, visitor centre and the gatehouse exhibition where you can learn all about the history surrounding the event. You can climb to the top of the gatehouse for excellent views over the area too. The 1066 Country Walk passes through the town. The waymarked footpath follows in the steps of William the Conqueror, additionally visiting Pevensey Castle and Herstmonceux Castle. It's a great way of exploring the area while visiting more major historical highlights on the way.",
