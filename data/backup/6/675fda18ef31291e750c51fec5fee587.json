Walter Rothschild was responsible for introducing numerous exotic animals - including wallabies, cassowaries, quaggas and rheas - into the Park's extensive grassland. Today the Park, which is managed by the Woodland Trust, is home to much less exotic sheep and cattle. This view is towards Pitstone Hill (skyline, right of centre)."

The stripes look just about the right width."

  "description": "This splendid park in the Chilterns AONB has lots of good walking trails to try. In the park you will find expansive areas of grassland and pretty bluebell woods ideal for a peaceful afternoon stroll. There's lots of wildflowers and butterflies in the summer months with great views from the park's high points. It's a great area for wildlife watching with orange tip, marbled white and common blue butterflies to look out for. Also keep your eyes peeled for kestrel, red kite, woodpeckers, nuthatch, chifffchaff, willow warbler and blackcap. The park is located just to the south of the Tring town centre. You can park at the Natural History Museum car park and then pick up the trails into the park. Tring park is in a great location for extending your walking in the area. The Icknield Way Path and the Ridgeway long distance trails both pass through the southern section of the park. If you head west you can enjoy woodland cycling and walking trails in the expansive Wendover Woods. It's only about 2 miles west of the park and includes waymarked walks, sculptures and more great views of the Chilterns countryside. Just to the east of the park is the Grand Union Canal which you can follow north to Marsworth and the lovely Tring Reservoirs .",
