  "description": "This pretty village is in a great location for exploring some of the most attractive parts of the Cranborne Chase AONB. This circular walk from the village visits some of the local highlights including Fontmell and Melbury Downs, Compton Abbas Airfield, Win Green Hill, Melbury Wood, the village of Melbury Abbas and Melbury Hill. The route starts in the village and then heads east through the Fontmell and Melbury Downs Nature reserve towards the Compton Abbas Airfield. The airfield is a local attraction offering flight experiences in vintage aircraft and classic car driving. The walk continues east along the airfield before turning north and then east to climb to Win Green Hill. The hill is notable as the highest point in the Cranborne Chase AONB, commanding wonderful views over Salisbury Plain, Shaftesbury, Glastonbury Tor, the Mendips, the Quantocks, the Purbecks and the south coast. You then head west to visit Melbury Wood where there's a series of peaceful woodland trails to try. You'll then pass Melbury Down before turning north to visit the neighbouring village of Melbury Abbas. From here it is a short walk west to climb up to the splendid viewpoint at Melbury Beacon. After taking in the views you descend east and then south to return to the village.",
