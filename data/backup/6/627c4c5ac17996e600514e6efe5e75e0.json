  "description": "This walk visits a beautiful loch in the Scottish Borders near Hawick. The lake has a car park and picnic area next to the causeway. You can enjoy a stroll along the lakeshore here and cross the causeway for a great view down both ends of the lake. The reservoir is located on Ale Water, a tributary of the River Teviot. There are some fine views across the water to the forestry on Alemoor Hill. Hellmoor Loch is also located just a mile or so to the north. If you head south you could continue your walking along the Romans and Reivers Route. This long distance route follows the old Roman Roads from the Ae Forest to Hawick. The Cross Borders Drove Road can also be picked up here.",
