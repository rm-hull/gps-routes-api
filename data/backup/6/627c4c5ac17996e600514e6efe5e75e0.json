  "description": "This walk visits a beautiful loch in the Scottish Borders near Hawick. The lake has a car park and picnic area next to the causeway. You can enjoy a stroll along the lakeshore here and cross the causeway for a great view down both ends of the lake. The reservoir is located on Ale Water, a tributary of the River Teviot. There are some fine views across the water to the forestry on Alemoor Hill. Hellmoor Loch is also located just a mile or so to the north. If you head south you could continue your walking along the Romans and Reivers Route. This long distance route follows the old Roman Roads from the Ae Forest to Hawick. The Cross Borders Drove Road can also be picked up here.",

      "content": "In the 19th century, the loch was described as circular, measuring 0.4 kilometres across and reaching depths of up to 55 metres. It was reputedly inhabited by a \"water-cow\" or kelpie, a mythical creature, and there was a tale of a child being snatched by an eagle and dropped into the loch. These ominous associations of the loch were captured in John Leyden's 1803 poem \"Scenes of Infancy.\" In the 1960s, the loch underwent a significant transformation with the construction of a dam, resulting in its enlargement to the current size. An existing farmhouse submerged during this process occasionally reveals its chimney pots during periods of extremely low water levels. The loch is now a popular spot for coarse fishing, home to species like pike, perch, and roach. Additionally, the historical remains of a tower at Wester Alemoor, once situated by the loch's edge, were demolished to make way for a new road prior to 1962. In 2003, a large flint blade was discovered near the loch, adding a layer of archaeological interest to the area."
