  "description": "This Cheshire based village sits close to the border with Derbyshire in the valley of the Todd Brook in the Pennines. The village is surrounded by a photogenic, undulating landscape of limestone and gritstone. It's a popular area for walkers with several local reservoirs and the splendid Lyme Park just a few miles to the north. This circular walk from the village takes you to some of the local walking highlights including the viewpoints at Windgather Rocks and Pym Chair. You'll then go on to enjoy the waterside trails at Errwood Reservoir and Fernilee Reservoir. The reservoirs lie just to the south east of the village in the beautiful valley of the River Goyt. To continue your walking around Kettleshulme you could head west to pick up the Gritstone Trail and follow it north to visit Lyme Park. The park includes resident deer, lakes, woodland trails, an historic house and hill climbs with some wonderful views towards Manchester.",
