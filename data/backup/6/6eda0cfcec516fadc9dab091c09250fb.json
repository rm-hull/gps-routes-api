  "description": "This walk takes you along Loch Lomond, through woodland to Craigie Fort. The walk starts from the Balmaha car park/visitor centre where there's plenty of parking. It's a short climb along peaceful woodland trails to the fort where there are super views across the loch. If you would like to continue your walk in this area then you could climb Conic Hill for great views over the loch. You could also catch the ferry to Inchcailloch Island and enjoy nature trails and a little beach.",
