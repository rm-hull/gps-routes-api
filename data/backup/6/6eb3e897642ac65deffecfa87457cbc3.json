  "description": "This large area of woodland is located near Marlborough in the North Wessex Downs AONB. In the woods you'll find miles of walking and cycling trails, with thousands of acres of ancient woodland to explore. As well as the peaceful trails there's a number of ponds, hill climbs, an arboretum, lots of bluebells in the spring and a variety of woodland birds to look out for. There's also some open farmland with grazing cattle and hundreds of beeches and oaks, with tree lined avenues, and coniferous plantations. You can start off from the parking area in the north western corner of the forest, next to the campsite. Then pick up the trails heading south east into forest. For cyclists there's a nice trail running along the Grand Avenue through the centre of the forest. It's part of National Cycle Network Route 4 and you could continue your ride on our Marlborough to Reading Cycle Route. To extend your exercise you could head south east from the forest and visit Bedwyn Common and Great Bedwyn village. Here there are some nice waterside paths along the River Dun to enjoy. Just to the west of the forest you can pick up the long distance Wansdyke Path and visit the nearby West Woods where you'll find more good mountain bike trails and footpaths. In nearby Marlborough you can enjoy a lovely walk along the River Kennet or pick up long distance trails including the Chiseldon and Marlborough Railway Path and the Wessex Ridgeway .",
