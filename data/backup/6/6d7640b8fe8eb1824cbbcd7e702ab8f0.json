Excavations elsewhere suggest that this area may have had its own layer of defences such as sharpened stakes,at least where they were needed for defence. The outer courses of often triangular-shaped stones were in-filled with more random shaped and sized stones, possibly a more accurate restoration than seen elsewhere along the Roman Wall. The vallum can be seen in the field to the left (south side). Why does this short section of the wall have such a pronounced bend (just behind)? Whatever the reason, it did help this small section survive the road building that destroyed many miles of the structure west from Newcastle."

  "description": "Newcastle upon Tyne is the most populous city in the North East of England. There's lots of good options for walkers with riverside walks along the Tyne and Derwent Rivers plus a number of country parks and woodland areas to explore. This walk from the city centre takes you along the epic Hadrian's Wall Path to a historic Roman Fort on the wall. On the way there's riverside paths along the River Tyne and a visit to the Tyne Riverside Country Park . The walk starts on the Newcastle side of the impressive Tyne Bridge which links with Gateshead on the opposite side. The bridge was officially opened on 10 October 1928 by King\u00a0George V\u00a0and has since become a defining symbol of\u00a0Tyneside. From here you can pick up the Hadrian's Wall Path and follow the waymarked trail west along the river. You'll pass several old bridges and the areas of Elswick, South Benwell, Scotswood and Newburn before coming to the Tyne Riverside Country Park in Ryton. After exploring the park you continue west to Clara Vale where the trail leaves the river to head north to Heddon-on-the-Wall via Ashbank Wood. Here you join the wall itself and follow it west to the Vindobala Roman Fort at Rudchester. The fort guards the valley of the March Burn to the west, an ancient route leading to the south towards the Tyne ford at\u00a0Newburn. The name Vindobala means \u201cWhite Strength\u201d with the troops recruited from a coastal tribe of\u00a0Lower Germany. At the site there's an information board which will tell you all about the history of the area. After exploring the fort you retrace your steps to the river where you head west to Wylam . Here you can catch a direct train back to Newcastle.",
