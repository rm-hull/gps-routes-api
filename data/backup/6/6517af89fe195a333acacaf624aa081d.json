Previously, Torr Headland served as an ancient salmon port with a thriving commercial fishery that endured for centuries. However, due to overfishing, degradation of river habitats, and shifts in oceanic conditions, salmon populations declined rapidly, prompting the eventual prohibition of all commercial salmon fishing along Northern Ireland's coasts."

  "description": "This walk visits Torr Head on the beautiful County Antrim coast near Ballycastle. From the rugged headland there are some dramatic cliff top views to the nearby Rathlin Island and even into Scotland on a clear day. Torr Head is also notable as the closest point in Northern Ireland to Scotland, with only 12 miles separating them across the Irish Sea. The area also includes the remains of Altagore cashel, an ancient fort of some historical interest. There is a car park at the site where you can pick up a short circular trail around the headland. To reach Torr Head, the recommended route is to follow the Antrim Coast Road to the village of Ballyvoy. From there, turn onto the Torr Road and continue until reaching the Ballyvennaght Road junction. Proceed carefully along this mostly single-lane, winding, and hilly country road until reaching the sign for the Torr Head car park. Follow another single-lane country road from there to reach the destination at Torr Head.",
