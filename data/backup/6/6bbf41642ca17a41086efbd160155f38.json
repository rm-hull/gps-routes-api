  "description": "These two pretty lakes near Ferndown have a nice walking trail to try. The area is a popular bird watching site with a wide variety of birds to look out for on the water. These include  Black-necked Grebe, Garganey, Pintail, Goldeneye, Ruddy Duck, Little Gull and Yellow-legged Gull. It's a really peaceful spot, ideal for an easy afternoon stroll. You can park at the Haskins Garden Centre just to the north east of the lakes. Then follow Green Lane to the reserve. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the garden centre cafe. The Ferndown, Stour and Forest Trail and the Stour Valley Way both run past the site so you could extend your walk by picking up the riverside path. Heading east will take you past Bournemouth into Christchurch .",
