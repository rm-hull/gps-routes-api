  "description": "This walk visits Castle Loch in the small town of Lochmaben in Dumfries and Galloway. You can follow a circular trail around the pretty loch for a distance of about 3 miles. At the southern end of the loch there's also the remains of the 12th century Lochmaben Castle. Here you'll find some photogenic castle ruins with imposing defensive walls and a moat. There are a few car parks at the site where you can start your walk. The town is also home to Kirk Loch, Mill Loch and Upper Loch where you can extend your outing. On the western side of the loch the route passes along a section of the Annandale Way, a 90-kilometre (56 mi) hiking trail, which is officially designated by NatureScot as one of Scotland's Great Trails. The trail provides great views of the River Annan which flows through the area.",

      "content": "Head north west and you can explore the expansive Ae Forest where there are lots of good footpaths and cycling trails to try. The long distance Romans and Reivers Route also starts in the forest. This 52 mile route follows the old Roman Roads to Hawick in the Scottish Borders. Following the trail north east will take you to Moffat where you can enjoy a riverside walk along the River Annan on the Annadale Way. Head south along the Annandale Way and you could visit the historic Hoddom Castle near Ecclefechan. The 16th century tower house includes some nice woodland trails, pleasant riverside trails and the Coach House restaurant. A few miles to the east there's the climb to Burnswark Hill to try. There's an Iron Age Hill Fort and some nice views over the area from this historically significant hill."
