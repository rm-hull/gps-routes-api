  "description": "This walk visits Castle Loch in the small town of Lochmaben in Dumfries and Galloway. You can follow a circular trail around the pretty loch for a distance of about 3 miles. At the southern end of the loch there's also the remains of the 12th century Lochmaben Castle. Here you'll find some photogenic castle ruins with imposing defensive walls and a moat. There are a few car parks at the site where you can start your walk. The town is also home to Kirk Loch, Mill Loch and Upper Loch where you can extend your outing. On the western side of the loch the route passes along a section of the Annandale Way , a 90-kilometre (56\u00a0mi)\u00a0hiking trail, which is officially designated by\u00a0NatureScot\u00a0as one of\u00a0Scotland's Great Trails. The trail provides great views of the River Annan which flows through the area.",
