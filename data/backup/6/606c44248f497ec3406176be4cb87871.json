  "description": "This walk takes you along the sea wall from Goldcliff to Caldicot in the Newport area of South Wales. The flat grassy path runs for just under 10 miles, providing excellent views over the Severn Estuary. The walk starts from the Farmers Arms pub in Goldcliff. There's a car park here or another public car park just to south near Elm Tree Farm and the sea wall. From Goldcliff you can pick up trails heading south to the estuary. Here you can pick up the sea wall path heading east to Redwick, Magor Pill and Caldicot. Here you can extend your outing by visiting the medieval Caldicot Castle. For an alternative circular walk in the area, please see the Redwick Walk which starts from the nearby village of Redwick.",
