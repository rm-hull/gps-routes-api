Much safer for the grannies and toddlers (and me) who climb Rannerdale Knotts."

  "description": "Visit Rannerdale Knotts and Whiteless Pike on this circular walk in the beautiful Rannerdale valley. It's a small fell but its proximity to Buttermere and Crummock Water make it an attractive option for walkers. There's also good footpaths, fine views and a section through the lovely bluebell valley. You can start the walk from the small car park off the B5289, next to Crummock Water. Then head north through the bluebell valley. The area is managed by the National Trust and is a stunning sight in the spring months, when carpets of bluebells cover the hills. You then head east through High Rannerdale, passing along Squat Beck. Near Whiteless Breast you turn west and ascend to the 355\u00a0m (1,165\u00a0ft) summit of Rannerdale Knotts. It's a wonderful spot with views back down to Crummock Water and Buttermere Lake. To extend your walking in the area you could try the Crummock Water and Buttermere walks. Both lakes have lovely waterside paths to try. For a more challenging climb you could try the Grasmoor walk which starts from the nearby Rannerdale Bridge.",
