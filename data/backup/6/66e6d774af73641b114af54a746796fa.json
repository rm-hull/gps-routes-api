  "description": "This short walk from the town of Buckfastleigh takes you through the countryside to Buckfast Abbey. It's about a 1.5 mile walk passing the remains of the old chapel and phreatic maze cave system of Bakers Pit. You'll follow a mixture of quiet country lanes and public footpaths to the historic abbey. The site includes attractive grounds with a series of lovely gardens and an old water mill. At the abbey you can enjoy a peaceful stroll through the Lavender garden, Physic garden and Sensory garden. There's also a lovely restaurant with outdoor seating and views of the abbey. This walk starts in the centre of Buckfastleigh but you could also start from the railway station which is on the South Devon Railway. The splendid heritage railway can be picked up in Totnes and runs for about 6 miles with nice views over the River Dart. After exploring the fascinating old abbey the route returns to Buckfastleigh on the same paths. The abbey is the start point for the Abbot's Way long distance trail which will take you through the Dartmoor National Park to the ruins of Tavistock Abbey 22 miles to the west. The abbey sits on the fringes of Hembury Woods which is a great place to extend your walk. The site includes Hembury Castle Iron Age Hillfort and a series of shady woodland trails. The long distance Dartmoor Way passes just to the east of the abbey grounds. The trail will take you north to Ashburton where you can enjoy nice riverside paths along the River Ashburm. Heading west will take you to the village of Scoriton.",
