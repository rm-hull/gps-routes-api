The name Binley Woods was not adopted until the 1960s; the area is now an extensive estate, effectively a suburb of Coventry but politically within Rugby Borough. This is the southernmost point looking back along Woodlands Road towards Rugby Road as the snow of the previous week is gradually disappearing."

  "description": "This fairly modern suburban village is located close to Coventry and Rugby in the county of Warwickshire. For walkers there are a number of country parks, nature reserves and woodland areas within walking distance of the village. This walk from Binley Woods visits two of the local walking highlights at Brandon Woods and Brandon Marsh Nature Reserve. You can start the walk in the village centre and then head south east to the entrance to the woods. Follow the paths south and then west and you will come out of the woods near the railway crossing. Head south and then cross Brandon Lane and it will take you into the nature reserve. Here you'll find a series of lakes with lots of bird life to look out for. To continue your walking around the village head north along the Warwickshire Centenary Way to Coombe Country Park . There's a lovely large lake with a waterside footpath to try here.",
