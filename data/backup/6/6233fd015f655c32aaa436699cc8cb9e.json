  "description": "This Birmingham based town is the home of the splendid Sutton Park which lies just to the west. The expansive park includes 200 acres of open heathland, woodlands, wetlands, marshes and lakes. This walk from the town visits some of the local highlights including Rectory Park, New Hall Valley Country Park, Pype Hayes Park and the Plants Brook nature reserve. You can start the walk from Rectory Park which includes Sutton's main football park, mature woodland and wild grassland areas. From here it is a short walk south to the adjacent New Hall Valley Country Park where there are a some good walking and cycling trails. Park features include waterside trails along the Plants Brook, wildflower meadows and woodland trails. The route then continues south to visit the Dam at Walmley and Pype Hayes Park. There's 100 acres to explore here with a lake, ornamental gardens and woodland. On the eastern side of the park there's also the reservoirs and wildlife to see at the Plants Brook nature reserve.",
