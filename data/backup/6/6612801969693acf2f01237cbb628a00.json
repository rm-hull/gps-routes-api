      "content": "On the western side of Derwenwater, near the famous Catbells, you will find the delightful Lingholm Kitchen. It's one of the premium refreshment stops on the route and well worth some further investigation. The splendid cafe also includes the Kitchen gardens which Beatrix Potter credited as her inspiration for Mr McGregor\u2019s garden in The Tale of Peter Rabbit. The Victorian style garden has herbaceous borders while it\u2019s central areas are for vegetable production that is then served fresh daily in the Kitchen. Within the walled garden there is the splendid bonus of an outdoor gallery dedicated to Beatrix Potter\u2019s work in the Derwentwater area, much of it undertaken whilst she stayed at Lingholm. The gallery takes a journey through her years at Lingholm and the Northern Lakes and how she wrote and illustrated some of her best known stories here. From the kitchen there are tremendous views towards the surrounding mountains. It's a lovely place to get a bite to eat and then enjoy a little stroll around the gardens afterwards. Also on the estate is an Alpaca Farm where you can take part in feeding time and ask the keepers all about these beautiful animals. The Borrowdale Gates Hotel is located on the route in Grange, just south of Derwentwater. The hotel is in a lovely spot and includes a terrace and some pretty gardens with fine views of the surrounding fells. During the colder months, open log fires are lit in the lounges all day, providing warmth and cosiness for reading and drinks. The restaurant is open to non residents and includes panoramic windows offering captivating fell views to complement the imaginative menu. It's a fine place to enjoy a meal and then stroll around the pretty gardens surrounding the hotel. You can find the Borrowdale Gates in Grange at postcode CA12 5UQ."

      "content": "Another notable route attraction can be found near Catbells at Brandlehow Park, considered the birthplace of the National Trust. The lakeside park has some interesting wooden sculptures including the cupped hands (below) which commemorates the centenary of the National Trust's first ever land purchase, 108 acres of the Brandlehow estate. Octavia Hill, one of the founders of the Trust, planted a tree at the official opening of Brandelhow to the public in October 1902. It's another very pleasant place for a stroll, with peaceful woodland paths and lots of interesting flora and fauna. Look out for kingfishers, woodpeckers, nuthatches, roe deer, red squirrels and, if you're very lucky, perhaps even an otter.  Above: The wooden sculptures in Brandlehow Park. You will often see children climbing on them! For more walking ideas in the area see the Cumbria Walks andLake District Walks pages."
