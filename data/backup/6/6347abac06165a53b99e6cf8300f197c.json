  "description": "This attractive market town is located in the Leeds area of West Yorkshire. There's some good countryside and woodland trails along the Pudsey Beck to try in the area. The town also includes the lovely Pudsey Park, one of the most popular parks in West Yorkshire. This walk explores the countryside around the town, following the pretty Pudsey Beck to Troydale and the viewpoint at Post Hill to the east of the settlement. The walk starts on the western side of the town in Westroyd Hill. Here you can pick up the waymarked Leeds Country Way and follow the waymarked footpath along the Tyersal Beck passing Black Carr and Bankhouse Bottom before coming to the Pudsey Beck. You then follow the beck east through woodland to Roker Lane Bottom, passing the old ruined mills on the way. Here you turn north to explore the woodland at Troy Dale before climbing to Post Hill where the route finishes. The hill is a pleasant nature area where you can enjoy fine views over the area from the summit. The area is great for flora and fauna with wildlife such as great spotted woodpecker and tawny owl to look out for.",
