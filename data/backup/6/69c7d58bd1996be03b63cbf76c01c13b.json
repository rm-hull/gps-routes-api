  "description": "This pretty village is located in the Bromsgrove District of Worcestershire. There's some good country trails with local walking highlights including the splendid Clent Hills to the north and the peaceful Chaddesley Wood to the south. The village is also located close to the expansive Wyre Forest where there are miles of good walking and cycling trails and the Button Oak Meadow Nature Reserve to explore. This circular walk from the village visits neighbouring Drayton using the public footpaths to the south and west of the settlement. On the way there's some nice countryside views and a waterside section along the pretty Drayton pool to enjoy.",
