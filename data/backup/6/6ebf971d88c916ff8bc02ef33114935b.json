  "description": "This Hampshire based town sits on the county border with Surrey. Although the area is quite built up it is close to a number of expansive woodland areas which lie just to the east. Hawley Lake and Common is another good local option with miles of trails just to the north west of the town centre. The Basingstoke Canal Walk can also be picked up just to the south. The town is well known for its annual airshow and an interesting aviation history including the first powered flight in Britain in 1908. This circular walk from the town visits Frimley Hatches Nature Reserve and the Blackwater Valley Footpath located just to the east of the settlement. You'll also visit the historic Farnborough Abbey which dates back to 1881. Public tours of the Abbey take place every Saturday at 3pm, with the visit comprising a tour of the church and a visit to the crypt. At the Frimley nature reserve you'll find a number of lakes where you can look out for a variety of water loving birds. For more detail on the town, including the history, politics, local landmarks and notable residents see the informative wikipedia page.",
