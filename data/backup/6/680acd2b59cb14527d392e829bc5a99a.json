  "description": "Try the delightful family trail in these magical woods near Coleford in the Forest of Dean. In the woods you will find ancient trees, rope bridges, interesting rock formations, secret caves and overhanging boulders. There's a number of maze like paths to follow around the 14 acre site with fascinating geological features. These originated through the erosion of natural underground cave systems formed in the Carboniferous Limestone many millions of years ago. Puzzlewood is thought to have provided the inspiration for the forests of Middle-earth in the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. It was also used as a film location for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The woods are located just to the south west of Cannop Ponds. It's a great place to continue your walking with gentle trails taking you around the two large ponds. You are also very close to the Speech House Walk and the excellent Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail. It's another great family walk with a series of high-quality, contemporary sculptures, in a delightful setting. The Gloucestershire Way long distance footpath can also be picked up just to the east.",
