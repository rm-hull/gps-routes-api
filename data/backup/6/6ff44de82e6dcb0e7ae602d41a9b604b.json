The first record of a chalk figure dates from 1710 and the 226 foot figure has been scaled in a way so as not to look short and stumpy from below. Whether the figure dates back to antiquity has been much debated but is generally believed not to. The figure is in the current ownership of the Sussex Archeological Society who received it from the Duke of Devonshire along with nearby Wilmington Priory in 1926."

  "description": "The riverside village of Alfriston is located in a wonderful spot for exploring the South Downs. This circular walk visits some of the highlights of the area including Cuckmere River and Cuckmere Haven, Seven Sisters Country Park, Long Man of Wilmington and Friston Forest. The route runs for just under 12 miles, using sections of The South Downs Way National Trail and other public trails and paths that run through the countryside to the east of Alfriston. The walk starts on the eastern side of the village where you cross the river and pick up the South Downs Way trail. Follow it north east and will climb to the Long Man on Wilmington Hill. The striking hill figure is thought to have originated in the Iron Age or even the neolithic period. From the hill top there are fine views over the Downs to the coast. The trail then heads south and the west to visit the Lullington Heath Nature Reserve. It's a lovely area made up of chalk heath with heather, bell heather and gorse bushes. The trail then skirts the edge of the expansive Friston Forest before heading through the Seven Sisters Country Park to Cuckmere Haven. The route then heads back to Alfriston, passing Charleston Manor before a final riverside section leads you back into the village.",

There's also the Alfriston Clergy House which dates from the 15th century and was the first property to be purchased by the National Trust. It has a thatched roof, timber-framed walls and a pretty garden which is well worth seeing. For another nice circular walk from the village head up to nearby Firle Beacon by following the South Downs Way north west. After enjoying the fine views from the summit you can follow the Comp Lane track back into Alfriston."
