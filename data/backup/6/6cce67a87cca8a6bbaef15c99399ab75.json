  "description": "This Cumbrian town lies just to the north of Barrow in Furness and just a few miles from the coast. Local walking highlights include the wildlife rich Sandscale Haws National Nature Reserve and the long distance Cistercian Way which runs through the town. This walk takes you along a section of the Way to visit two of the significant local historical sites. You'll pass the 14th century Dalton Castle before following country trails south to the Abbotswood Nature Reserve and Furness Abbey. Here you can enjoy a stroll around the grounds of the photogenic abbey ruins which dates back to the 12th century. Dalton castle is owned by the National Trust and includes the old courtroom and gaol. You can explore the ancient building and learn all about its history from the knowledgeable guides. The castle has strong links to the nearby Furness Abbey so the walk ties these two signficant sites together very nicely.",
