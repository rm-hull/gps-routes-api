  "description": "This lovely park near Chelmsford is a great place for an afternoon stroll. The Centenary Circle long distance trail runs around the boundary of the park so you can explore this area for free on a good waymarked trail. You can park near Writtle to start your walk. Then follow the path south past South Wood before turning east. You then cross the River Wid before heading through Galleywood Common and finishing in the village of Galleywood. Here you can enjoy refreshments before heading back along the same path. The wider estate includes 574 acres of parkland with ancient woodland, grassland, ponds, lakes and formal gardens. There's several other marked walks within the grounds with a serpentine Lake, rare breed horses and lovely Pleasure Gardens with a range of landscaping and plants. You can also admire the Grade II neo-classical villa of Hylands House with an interesting history going back to the 18th century. To extend your walking in the Chelmsford area you could continue along the Centenary Circle to Great Baddow and Chelmer Village where you can pick up the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation. Near here you can also visit Danbury Country Park and Danbury Common where there's good walking trails, woodland and lakes to enjoy.",
