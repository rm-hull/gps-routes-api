  "description": "Climb to this wonderful viewpoint and enjoy views over the Wye Valley AONB on this circular walk in Tintern in the Forest of Dean. You can start the walk from the car park off the B4228 just north of Tidenham. You then head west through woodland before a moderate climb to the Devil's Pulpit. From here there are splendid views over Tintern Abbey and the River Wye. After taking in the views you pick up the Offa's Dyke Path to take you through Worgan's Wood to Tidenham Chase. You then follow Miss Grace's Lane back to the woods from the start of the route. To extend the walk you could continue along the Offa's Dyke Path to Woodcroft and Chepstow in Wales. If you head north you can visit Caswell Wood and Oakhill Wood. Caswell Woods consist of a variety of interesting plants and trees with bare limestone rock which attract Kestrels. At Brockweir you can cross the river then follow it round to the fascinating Tintern Abbey ruins. Heading south along the path will take you to the magnificent limestone cliffs at Wintour's Leap. The popular rock climbing spot is a couple of miles south of Tidenham near the village of Woodcroft. For an alternative route from Tintern Abbey to Devil's Pulpit see the video below.",

      "content": "Just to the north you could visit the interesting village of St Briavels. Here you will find the historic St Briavels Castle which dates back to the 12th century and is open to the public under the care of English Heritage. The village can be accessed by crossing the Bigsweir Bridge over the Wye from Llandogo in Wales to St Briavels in England on the other side. In Llandogo you can enjoy a walk to the pretty Cleddon Falls on the River Cleddon. The circular Brockweir Walk visits the station, the abbey and the Devil's Pulpit from the nearby village. The Wye Valley Greenway runs to Tintern abbey from nearby Sedbury. The shared cycling and walking trail follows a disused railway line, notably passing through the murky Tidenham Tunnel on the way. It passes the hill just to the west. For more walking ideas in the area see the Wye Valley Walks page."
