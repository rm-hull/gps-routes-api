  "description": "This little village is located in a lovely spot in on the River Deben Peninsula in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It includes a pretty quay, a little beach and many pretty old cottages associated with the nearby Bawdsey Manor. This walk from the village takes you along the Suffolk Coast Path to the nearby resort of Felixstowe. On the way you'll pass the noteworthy Bawdsey Manor where radar research took place early in World War II. Many of the old cottages in the village were built by the Quilter family of Bawdsey Manor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as model cottages for their workers. The walk starts from car park just to the east of the village. From here it is a short stroll to the waymarked coastal path which you can follow south west along Bawdsey Beach to Bawdsey Manor. Near here you can catch the Ferry over Woodbridge Haven to Felixstowe Ferry on the other side of the water. The path then heads along the coast at Felixstowe before finishing at the pier.",
