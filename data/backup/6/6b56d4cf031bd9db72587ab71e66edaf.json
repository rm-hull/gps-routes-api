  "description": "Enjoy walking and cycling in this large park in Manchester. The park has miles of nice walking trails while National Cycle Network Route 85 also runs through it. The park covers 260 acres (109 hectares) and includes wildflower meadows, pretty gardens, herbaceous borders, woodland and grassland. You can also enjoy a waterside stroll along the Baguley Brook and visit the community farm. Here you'll find cows, sheep, goats, pigs, ducks, horses and all the elements of a working countryside farm in an urban setting. The extensive parkland surrounds the 16th-century medieval house of Wythenshawe Hall. The timber-framed manor house was home to the Tatton family for over 600 years. To extend your exercise you could head through Northenden and pick up the Trans Pennine Trail along the River Mersey. Also nearby is Chorlton Water Park where there are more nice walking and cycling trails around a large lake. Just beyond there is Sale Water Park which is also well worth a visit.",
