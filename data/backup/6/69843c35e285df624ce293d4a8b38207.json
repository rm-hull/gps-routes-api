  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk or cycle around this large common in Surrey. The common covers hundreds of acres and has a series of good footpaths over grassland, lowland heath and woodland. The area is also crisscrossed with wide bridleways which are ideal for an off road cycle. Chobham Common is the largest National Nature Reserve in the south east of England. As such there is a diverse range of flora and fauna. Look out for over 100 species of bird including the rare dartford warbler, the hobby and the nightjar. In the wetland areas look out for frogs, newts, adders, grass snakes, lizards, slow worms, foxes and possibly deer. Plants and flowers include purple heather, gorse and orchids. It's a really attractive area with lots of nice stony footpaths to follow. You could easily spend a few hours strolling around looking out for wildlife. This circular walk starts at the car park on Staple Hill and follows various footpaths past Albury Bottom to Gracious Pond. You then follow woodland paths and bridleways back to the car park. If you would like to continue your walk then you could head a few miles north to the lovely Virginia Water Lake .",
