  "description": "Visit this prominent hill in Dorset and enjoy wonderful views over the county on this walk in Marshwood Vale. The hill is the second highest point in Dorset and has a fascinating history. It is topped by an\u00a0Iron Age\u00a0hill fort where the remains of 14\u00a0roundhouses\u00a0have been uncovered. Flint tools over 10,000 years old\u00a0and Bronze Age burial mounds have also been discovered in the area. In the late 18th century Dorothy and William Wordsworth lived nearby and were comforted by the surrounding hills as they were reminded of their native Lake District. The walk starts from a car park on the junction of Pilsdon Lane and Cockpit Hill. A short walk takes you to the 277\u00a0m (909\u00a0ft) high point where there are fabulous views of Marshwood Vale, the Golden Cap Estate the south coast and the Quantocks. You then follow the Wessex Ridgeway west before returning on an alternative bridleway. If you would like to extend your walk you could visit the high point in Dorset by heading east to Lewesdon Hill .",
