  "description": "This popular Somerset seaside town sits in a fine spot on the River Brue and on the mouth of the River Parrett at Bridgwater Bay. There's some lovely beach walking and a nice riverside trail to try in the town too. This walk from the town takes you along the coast path to one of the area's highlights at Brean Down. It's about an 8 mile walk along the Burnham sea wall and beach before a climb up onto the Down at the end. The walk starts on the sea front in Burnham near the pier. You could park at the Pier Street car park at postcode TA8 1BT for your sat navs. You can then follow the footpaths north to the unusual looking lighthouse at the northern end of the town. The photogenic building is something of a local landmark with its distinctive white and red stripes. The route then continues north to the attractive Berrow Dunes where there are some good wildlife spotting opportunites. You continue through Brean village where you could take a detour to see the village's 13th century church if you have time. The route then continues north along the wide expanse of Brean Sands before climbing up onto Brean Down. The Down is one of the walking highlights of the Mendips with fine views of the Bristol Channel, south Wales and Weston Super Mare from the summit. At the seaward end you will also find Brean Down Fort which was built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War.",

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "To continue your walking around the town you could head south and pick up a riverside footpath along the River Brue. You could follow it east towards neighbouring Highbridge. Near Brean down you can pick up the West Mendip Way at Uphill. This long distance waymarked trail explores the western section of the Mendip hills. Also near here you can enjoy two more excellent viewpoints at Bleadon Hill and Brent Knoll which lies just a few miles to the east of the town. You can reach the knoll by following a footpath east from the northern tip of the town. For more walking ideas in the area see the Mendip Hills Walks and Somerset Walks pages."
