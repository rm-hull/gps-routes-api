  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk around the beautiful Virginia Water in Windsor. The lake is located within the wonderful Windsor Great Park and is surrounded by woodland and gardens. A well defined walking path runs around the lake taking you to a number of interesting sites. You'll pass the 18th century ornamental cascade and the Leptis Magna Ruins - a Roman style temple built from columns and lintels brought from the ancient city of Leptis Magna in the early 19th Century. There is also a striking 100-foot high Totem Pole and the Virginia Water Pavilion built from wood from Windsor Great Forest. Right next to the lake are the stunning Valley Gardens . Here you'll find 250 acres of landscaped gardens and woodlands to explore using a series of well defined walking trails. You could also head further into Windsor Great Park to extend your walk.",
