  "description": "This pleasant riverside walk takes you along the River Inver in the Assynt district of Sutherland, Highland. You can pick up the trail on Baddidaroch Road just north of the village which lies on the eastern side of Loch Inver. The path then heads east passing some attractive woodland and photogenic weirs. There's also a wooden footbridge you can cross for views from the other side. As you proceed along the track there are also some fine views of the surrounding hills and countryside. The river eventually flows into Loch Assynt, the source of the river. Near here you could extend your outing by visiting Eas a' Chual Aluinn, the highest waterfall in the UK. Just south of the village there's the peaceful woodland trails around Culag Woods to try.",
