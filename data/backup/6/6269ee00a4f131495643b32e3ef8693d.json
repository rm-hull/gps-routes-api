  "description": "This market town is situated in a lovely spot on the River Camel in North Cornwall. This walk from the town follows the popular Camel Trail along the estuary to nearby Padstow. The walk runs for just over 5 miles, following a fairly flat waymarked trail for the whole way. The route starts in Wadebridge and follows the trail north west, passing Tregunna, Pinkson Creek, Lower Halwyn, Ball Hill, Dennis Hill and Tregonce before coming into Padstow. There's lovely views to the Camel Estuary where you can look out for a variety of birdlife including herons and little egrets. If you head south along the trail it will take you towards Bodmin, passing Grogley Woods on the way. The woods are a good local spot for walks and mountain biking with several challenging black trails to try.",

      "content": "Wadebridge also lies on the Saints Way. This long distance trail takes you across the county from Padstow in the north to Fowey on the south coast. It follows the probable route of early Christian travellers making their way from Ireland to the Continent. In Padstow you can pick up the Padstow to Trevone Bay Walk, the Padstow to Harlyn Bay Walk and head up to the popular headland at Stepper Point. There's also the option of catching the ferry over to Rock and heading north on the Rock to Polzeath Walk. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
