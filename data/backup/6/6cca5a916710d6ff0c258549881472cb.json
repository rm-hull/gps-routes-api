  "description": "This country park contains several large reservoirs and some beautiful open moorland. It is ideal for walking and cycling with the super Pennine Bridleway and the Tame Valley Way both passing through the park.  You can stay in the  lower part of the Brushes Valley and around Carrbrook for flatter, well surfaced paths or climb to Wild Bank where there are fabulous views of the Pennine Moors. The waterside stretch along Walkerwood Reservoir , Brushes Reservoir and the Swineshaw Reservoirs is particularly lovely. The park is located a couple of miles east of the centre of Stalybridge.",
