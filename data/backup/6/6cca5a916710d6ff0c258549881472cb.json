  "description": "This country park contains several large reservoirs and some beautiful open moorland. It is ideal for walking and cycling with the super Pennine Bridleway and the Tame Valley Way both passing through the park. You can stay in the lower part of the Brushes Valley and around Carrbrook for flatter, well surfaced paths or climb to Wild Bank where there are fabulous views of the Pennine Moors. The waterside stretch along Walkerwood Reservoir, Brushes Reservoir and the Swineshaw Reservoirs is particularly lovely. The park is located a couple of miles east of the centre of Stalybridge.",

      "content": "There's plenty of other walks to try around Stalybridge. To the east you can pick up the popular Longdendale Trail and visit Bottoms Reservoir, Torside Reservoir and Woodhead Reservoir. At the eastern end of Woodhead Reservoir there's a car park where you can start the Middle Black Clough Waterfall Walk. The area is a bit of a hidden gem with walks along the River Etherow to some beautiful waterfalls and wonderful rock formations. On the northern side of Torside Reservoir there's the hamlet of Crowden which is a popular start point for many walks. For example you could try the Crowden Black Hill Walk which climbs to the highest point in the historic county of Cheshire. There's great views to be enjoyed on this challenging climb and a visit to Black Chew Head, the highest point in Greater Manchester. Arnfield Reservoir is located just to the south east of the park and has a nice walking trail to try. Our walk takes you along the eastern edge of the reservoir before visiting the woodland and lake in the nearby Hollingworth Nature Reserve. The long distance Tameside Trail passes just to the east of the park. The 30 mile circular walk explores several of the highlights of the River Tame Valley. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
