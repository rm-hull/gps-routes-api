  "description": "Climb to this wonderful viewpoint on this circular walk in Mortimer Forest in Ludlow . It's a challenging climb with the High Vinnalls viewpoint reaching a height of over 1200ft. From the high points there are fabulous panoramic\u00a0views over the surrounding Herefordshire countryside. This walk uses part of the Mortimer Trail long distance footpath. It starts at the High Vinnalls car park but you could start from Ludlow and follow the Mortimer Trail through the Mary Knoll Valley to reach the hill. To extend your walk you could follow the trail south to Croft Ambrey Hill Fort and woods. You'll also find the magnificent Croft Castle surrounded by 1500 acres of parkland, farmland and woods. Just to the east of the hill you will also find Overton Common and a deer park.",
