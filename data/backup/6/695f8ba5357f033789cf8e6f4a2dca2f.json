The original motte and bailey castle, the remains of which can be seen to the south of the churchyard, was built here in the Forest of Galtres by Bertram de Bulmer, Sheriff of York during the reign of King Stephen (c. 1135\u20131154). The stone castle was built at the western end of the village by John, Lord Neville in the late fourteenth century. The castle is Grade II listed."

  "description": "This village is located in the Ryedale area of North Yorkshire. The village is close to the Howardian Hills and there's also a number of waymarked trails running through the attractive surrounding countryside. The historic settlement includes a photogenic ruined castle, a Grade I listed 12th century church and a fine country pub to relax in after your exercise. This route from the village uses sections of the Foss Walk, the Ebor Way and the Centenary Way to create a circular walk around the settlement. The walk starts at the remains of Sheriff Hutton castle on the southern side of the village. From here you can pick up the waymarked footpaths and follow them south to West Lilling and New Lane. You then turn north west along the Foss Walk to Sheriff Hutton Bridge where there are views of the old course of the River Foss. The trail heads north through farmland to Cornborough Manor where you turn east to follow the trail back to the village, via Mill Hill.",
