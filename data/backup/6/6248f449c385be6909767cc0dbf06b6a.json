  "description": "This circular walk visits Devon's Holne Woods, near the village of Holne on the southeastern slopes of Dartmoor. On the walk you will pass along miles of peaceful woodland trails next to the River Dart. At the northern end of the route you will come to the Dart Valley Nature Reserve where you can enjoy some pretty waterfalls and look out for a variety of birdlife. The return leg passes the lovely Venford Waterfall before coming to Venford Reservoir where there is a nice waterside trail to try. In this area there's an optional detour to Bench Tor where there are some interesting geological rock formations and great views over the Dart Valley to enjoy. To continue your walking in the area head south east to visit Hembury Woods. There are similar river trails and the ancient Hembury Castle Hill Fort to see in this area.",
