  "description": "This waterside walk visits the impressive Dundas Aqueduct in Somerset. The Scheduled Ancient Monument carries the Kennet and Avon Canal over the River Avon (the Somerset / Wiltshire border) and the Wessex Main Line railway from Bath to Westbury. Start the walk from the car park at the Canal Visitor Centre at Brassknocker Hill in Monkton Combe. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north to Dundas Wharf and the aqeuduct. The structure was completed in 1805 and is 150 yards (137.2 m) long with three arches built of Bath Stone. The canal crosses back across the Avon and the railway on another aqueduct at Avoncliff where there is another fine walk to try. You can climb up onto the aqueduct and enjoy fine views down to the River Avon below and across the surrounding Somerset countryside. To extend the walk you could continue along the towpaths of either the Kennet and Avon Canal or Somerset Coal Canal. Heading south well take you to Avoncliff so you could take in two aqueducts on your outing. It's about a 3 mile walk to the neighbouring sctructure and well worth a visit if you have time.",
