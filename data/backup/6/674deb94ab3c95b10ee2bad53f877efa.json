The Pear motif not only adorns the main tower, but also the corner turrets and many other locations. The name comes from a farm which occupied part of the site. Impressive as this building is, the original plan was for a 'double-fronted' mill, twice the size of what exists; the main tower would have been in the centre of the facade. The building is fully occupied and is in generally very good order."

  "description": "The Goyt Valley is an excellent place for walks with fine riverside trails along the Rivers Goyt and Etherow. There's also a number of pretty reservoirs and splendid views of the Peak District hills. This walk takes you through the beautiful valley from Stockport to Hadfield along the waymarked Etherow Goyt Valley Way. If you'd like to explore the Upper Goyt Valley then see the Errwood Reservoir and Fernilee Reservoir Walk. This will take you along two lovely reservoirs near Whaley Bridge. This path starts in Vernon and Woodbank Park on the River Goyt in Stockport and follows the river to Etherow Country Park near Marple. This is a lovely section with a reservoir, woodland and a variety of wildlife to enjoy. The walk then joins the River Etherow following it to Broadbottom and then onto Bottoms Reservoir in Hadfield. There is a challenging climb near Broadbottom on this route but with fantastic views over the surrounding area.",

The 16th century pub does very good food and has a nice cosy fire for winter days. You can easily find the pub in the village at a postcode of SK13 1JY for your sat navs. It's a great place to stop on the route and also very dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you. In Etherow Country Park the on site cafe is a nice place for a pit stop. You can sit outside here and enjoy views over the park's lake with its variety of wildfowl."

      "content": "Near Bottoms Reservoir you can pick up the Longdendale Trail, a shared cycling and walking trail which takes you along a series of pretty reservoirs. The Goyt Way also takes you along the River Goyt through the valley. It also includes more waterside walking along the towpath of the Peak Forest Canal. Just north of Etherow Country Park the trail skirts the edge of Werneth Low Country Park. The park includes a splendid hill top viewpoint with excellent views over the valley, Greater Manchester and the Pennine Hills. There's also a fine parkside pub for refreshments. For a climb in the area see the Shining Tor and Cats Tor Walk page. There's excellent views over the valley from the viewpoint. In this area you'll also find some easy waterside walking around Lamaload Reservoir, Errwood Reservoir and Fernilee Reservoir. Near Marple you could take a small detour to explore the historic Chadkirk Country Estate in Romiley. There's a noteworthy 16th century chapel, a little cafe and a walled garden to enjoy here. The trail is coincident with the Tameside Trail around Broadbottom. The 30 mile circular walk explores several of the highlights of the River Tame Valley."
