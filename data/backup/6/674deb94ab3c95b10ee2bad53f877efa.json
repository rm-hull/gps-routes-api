The Pear motif not only adorns the main tower, but also the corner turrets and many other locations. The name comes from a farm which occupied part of the site. Impressive as this building is, the original plan was for a 'double-fronted' mill, twice the size of what exists; the main tower would have been in the centre of the facade. The building is fully occupied and is in generally very good order."

  "description": "The Goyt Valley is an excellent place for walks with fine riverside trails along the Rivers Goyt and Etherow. There's also a number of pretty reservoirs and splendid views of the Peak District hills. This walk takes you through the beautiful valley from Stockport to Hadfield along the waymarked Etherow Goyt Valley Way. If you'd like to explore the Upper Goyt Valley then see the Errwood Reservoir and Fernilee Reservoir Walk. This will take you along two lovely reservoirs near Whaley Bridge. This path starts in Vernon and Woodbank Park on the River Goyt in Stockport and follows the river to Etherow Country Park near Marple. This is a lovely section with a reservoir, woodland and a variety of wildlife to enjoy. The walk then joins the River Etherow following it to Broadbottom and then onto Bottoms Reservoir in Hadfield. There is a challenging climb near Broadbottom on this route but with fantastic views over the surrounding area.",
