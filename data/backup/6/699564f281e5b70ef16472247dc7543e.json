  "description": "Visit the wonderful grounds of the 14th century Bolton Castle before exploring the beautiful countryside surrounding the village. It's a short walk to the castle from the village of Castle Bolton. For a fee you can explore the gardens and the maze before climbing the castle for wonderful views over the Yorkshire Dales. You can also learn about the fascinating history of the castle. Mary, Queen of Scots stayed there for six months in the 16th century. After her defeat in Scotland at the Battle of Langside in 1568 she fled to England, posing a threat to the position of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I. After exploring the castle the walk then heads towards Low Thoresby before visiting the nearby village of Redmire. The attractive little village is the terminus of the Wensleydale Railway. The heritage railway runs 22 miles (35 km) between Northallerton West station and Redmire. It's a great way to see this beautiful area. From Redmire you cross the pretty Apedale Beck and return to the village. To extend your walking in the area you can head south west and visit the fabulous Aysgarth Falls. The falls are one of the most visited attractions of the area and are well worth a visit. The Herriot Way long distance footpath also runs through the area. The circular route takes you through areas of the Yorkshire Dales associated with the vet and author James Herriot. Head south to the River Ure and you can try our Wensleydale Walk which visits Redmire Force waterfall and the vilage of Wensley, which gives its name to the dale of Wensleydale.",
