  "description": "This pretty West Sussex village has some good walking country trails and a couple of fine old pubs for post exercise refreshment. There is also a historic church dating from the Norman period. The Grade I listed church is notable as the burial place of Harold Macmillan, ex-prime minster of Britain. This circular walk explores the countryside and woods to the north of the village. You'll visit a number of local fishing lakes before heading over to see the Horsted Keynes railway station on the old Bluebell Railway. The walk starts at the public car park in the village centre where you can pick up the Sussex Border Path and follow the waymarked trail north to Broadhurst Manor, passing a series of fishing lakes on the way. The route bends round to the west at Tanyard before heading south to Cinder Hill and then along the railway line to the old station on the heritage steam railway. You then pass Leamland Wood and Pain's Wood before returning to the village centre.",
