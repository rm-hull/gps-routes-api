The house and barn are just over the grid line, and are called Blake Hill End, though the hill behind has the old spelling, Bleak Hill. The barn has small semi-circular windows in the gable-end; these occur quite frequently around here. The lane has a high stone retaining wall on the left side."

  "description": "This circular walk explores Shibden Valley and Shibden Dale near Halifax in West Yorkshire. The valley is a lovely place for a walk with some hill climbs with fine views over the surrounding countryside. The walk starts from the car park at the popular Shibden Park on the north eastern side of the town. From here you can pick up trails heading north west towards Pepper Hill, Swales Moor and Lower Shibden Hall. The route then heads east across Shibden Dale, passing the old quarry before linking up with the Calderdale Way near Addersgate Farm. Follow the waymarked footpath east towards Stone Chair before turning south to Northowram. You then head south west to past Upper Brear to return to the park where you could enjoy some post walk refreshments at the on site cafe. The park is also well worth exploring with some fine walking trails taking you to woodland and a lovely lake.",
