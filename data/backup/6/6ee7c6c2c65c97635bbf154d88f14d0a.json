  "description": "This village in Ryedale is located to two highlights of the area in the shape of the historic Kirkham Abbey and the splendid Castle Howard . This walk from the village takes you north to visit Castle Howard. You can follow public footpaths and a section of the Centenary Way through part of the estate grounds to the nearby village of Coneysthorpe. On the way there's some lovely woodland trails, pretty lakes and fine views of the surrounding countryside. The expansive grounds of the fine stately home also include the splendid Yorkshire Arboretum. To continue your walking around Welburn head south to visit Kirkham Abbey. There's some lovely grounds, River Derwent views and fine gothic architecture to enjoy at the 12th century abbey site.",
