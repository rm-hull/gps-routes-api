  "description": "This easy walk follows the Wendover Arm of the Grand Union Canal from Wendover to Bulbourne. It's a pleasant stretch of canal, running for about 7 miles, with nice countryside views along the way. The walk starts in the centre of Wendover, heading north towards Halton and passing the Weston Turville Reservoir on the way. You then turn north east, passing Buckland Wharf and Drayton Beauchamp before coming to the lovely Tring Reservoirs. You'll pass Marsworth Reservoir where there are good opportunities for bird watching. Look out for grebes, bitterns, peregrine falcon, pied flycatcher and ringed plovers on the water. The canal finishes shortly after at Bulbourne but there is the option of continuing you walk along the Grand Union Canal. Heading north will take you past Marsworth towards Cheddington and Leigton Buzzard. Heading south will take you into Berkhamsted. Other good walking options around Wendover include the expansive Wendover Woods. There's miles of good walking and cycling trails to be found here. The long distance Aylesbury Ring also runs through the area.",
