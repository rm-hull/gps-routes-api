  "description": "This walk visits Hanham Woods in the south eastern part of Bristol. You can start the walk from the Avon Valley Woodland car park just to the east of the woods at Hanham Green. From here you head west to Hencliff Wood where there's some nice peaceful woodland trails with lovely views of the river Avon. In the woods you can also pick up the River Avon Trail and enjoy a stroll along the river. Head east from the car park and you could extend the walk by climbing up to the lovely viewpoint at Hanham Green. Just to the north there's the popular Conham River Park. There's another car park here providing an alternative start point for the walk. Along with Bickley Wood and Hencliffe Wood the park forms the Avon Valley Woodlands Nature Reserve.",
