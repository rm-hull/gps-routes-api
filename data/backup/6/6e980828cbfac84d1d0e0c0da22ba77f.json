  "description": "This North Yorkshire town sits in a prime spot for walkers, close to the edge of both the Forest of Bowland AONB and the Yorkshire Dales National Park. This circular walk from the town takes you along the River Wenning to the neighbouring village of Low Bentham. You can follow footpaths along both sides of the river with the start point close to the train station in Higher Bentham. The walk runs for just over 3 miles on fairly flat footpaths. To continue your walking in the area head a few miles north east to visit Ingleton Falls . This walk is one of the major highlights of the area, visiting a series of picturesque waterfalls around the village of Ingleton. Near here you can also climb to Twistleton Scar and Ingleborough Mountain for some amazing views over the area.",
