  "description": "A popular riverside walk between these Marlow and Henley-on-Thames. The walk follows a lovely section of the Thames Path National Trail for about 8 miles. There's locks, weirs, interesting villages and great views of the Chilterns countryside to enjoy. At the end of the walk you can return the same way or catch a bus back to Marlow to rest your legs. The walk starts on the Grade I listed Marlow Bridge which was opened in 1832. Follow the towing path west along the northern side of the river, passing the weir at Temple Lock and Temple Mill Island. The island was named after it's three watermills which have now been replaced with a modern housing development and a marina. You continue by crossing the river on the Temple Footbridge which connects the Buckinghamshire and Berkshire banks of the Thames. Shortly after you come to the village of Hurley where you will find the pretty Hurley Lock and Hurley Priory. The former Benedictine priory was founded in 1086 with the surviving priory church now used as the Hurley parish church. Also look out for kayakers around the rushing waters of Hurley. The route continues west, past Medmenham, Black Boy Island and Frog Mill Ait before coming to the hamlet of Aston. Follow the bend of the river round toward Hambleden Mill and Hambleden Lock. The historic watermill sits next to a large weir in a lovely spot on the river. The  Grade II listed mill has now been converted into flats overlooking the Thames. You can take a small detour here and cross the walkways over the weir from the lock to the small village of Mill End on the Buckinghamshire bank. After enjoying Hambleden you continue south towards Temple Island. The island is a well known local landmark as it is used as the start of the course for Henley Royal Regatta. It includes an elegant ornamental temple (folly) designed by the 18th century English architect James Wyatt and constructed in 1771. The next section takes you past the village of Remenham where there are fine views across the river to Fawley Court. The Grade I listed country house dates from the late 17th century and is noted for its fine architecture. The final section takes you into Henley-on-Thames finishing on Henley Bridge. The Grade I listed bridge was built in 1786 and includes five elliptical stone arches. To extend your walk you can pick up the Chiltern Way and the Oxfordshire Way long distance trails near Henley.",
