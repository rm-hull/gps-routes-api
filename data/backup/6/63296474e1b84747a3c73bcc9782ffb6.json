  "description": "This Oxfordshire based village is located near Burford and Chipping Norton . Milton is one of three villages named after the ancient Wychwood Forest with the others being Shipton Under Wychwood and\u00a0Ascott-under-Wychwood which lie just to the east. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring settlements of Fifield and Idbury before heading into the Foxholes Nature Reserve. You'll then pick up part of the Oxfordshire Way to visit Shipton Under Wychwood before returning to the village. On the way there's some lovely views of the surrounding countryside before the peaceful bluebell woodland at Foxholes. This area is also great for wildlife with lots of woodland birds to look out for.",
