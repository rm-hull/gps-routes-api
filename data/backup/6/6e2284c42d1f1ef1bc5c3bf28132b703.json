  "description": "A circular walk around Ramsbottom visiting some of the highlights of the area including River Irwell, Nuttall Park, Holcombe and the iconic Peel Tower. The walk starts from the train station and heads a short distance to the east to pick up the Irwell Sculpture Trail. Follow the path south and you will soon come to Nuttall Park where there's nice views of the surrounding hills, tree lined footpaths, river views and a series of sculptures. After exploring the park you continue south along the river to Brooksbottoms. Here you turn west to follow woodland trails towards Hazelhurst where you start to climb towards Peel Tower. The tower is a popular local landmark dedicated to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th century Prime Minister considered the father of modern British policing. There's great views over Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester and North Wales from the summit on Holcombe Hill. The route then descends from the tower to Holcombe where you follow minor roads back to the train station. To continue your walking in the Ramsbottom area, head south along the Irwell Sculpture Trail to nearby Bury. On the way you'll pass the historic old mills, heritage railway station and impressive viaduct at Summerseat before heading to Burrs Country Park. Here you'll find woodland, open space, wetland, ponds and waterways. In Bury there's some nice easy trails to follow around the pretty Elton Reservoir. Entwistle Reservoir and Wayoh Reservoir lie just to the west too.",

There's also the excellent Whitaker Museum and Art Gallery to visit here. On the way you would pass the worthy village of Irwell Vale with its views of the River Ogden and historic terraced mill cottages and gothic church. On the southern outskirts of the town there's some peaceful and serene woodland trails around Redisher Wood. In the woods there are also water features including the Holcombe Brook, a picturesque lake and waterfalls.
