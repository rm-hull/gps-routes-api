      "content": "The White Hart is a 17th-century inn that embodies the quintessential charm of an ancient hostelry, adorned with old farming and hunting tools embellishing the walls alongside horse brasses and hops dangling from exposed beams. Its welcoming ambience is enhanced by slate-flagged floors and a wood-burning stove. Offering high-quality cuisine crafted from locally sourced ingredients, the inn provides dining options in the bar, upstairs dining area, or on the terrace. Alongside a regular beer from Ulverston Brewery, guest ales typically hail from nearby breweries. A scenic 20-minute stroll unveils breathtaking views of the Rusland Valley and Coniston Old Man. They have a car park and garden area as well as being dog friendly."
