  "description": "This circular walk takes you through the countryside to the west of the small Shropshire town of Clun. On the way you'll visit the historic Clun Castle and the hamlet of Whitcott Keysett. There's also fine views of the Shropshire countryside and the Welsh Hills to enjoy. The walk makes use of two of the waymarked long distance trails that run through the area. You'll follow sections of the Shropshire Way \u00e1nd Offa's Dyke Path on the 9 mile route which includes some moderate hill climbs. The walk starts from the free car park at Clun Castle on the western side of Clun. The Norman castle includes a tall 13th century keep set on the side of its mound. You can explore the atmospheric ruins and enjoy fine views from the high points on the site. It's run by English Heritage and entry is free. After exploring the castle the route heads south over the River Clun on Clun Bridge before turning west to follow a country lane towards Llwyn and Burfield. At Springhill Cottage you pick up the Offa's Dyke Path and follow it north to Bryndinog where you cross the river again. Here you pick up a country lane and follow it east to the pretty little hamlet of Whitcott Keysett, picking up the Shropshire Way and following it back into the town.",
