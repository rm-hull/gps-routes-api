  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll along the Beverley Beck on this easy walk in the Yorkshire town. There's a nice footpath running along the pretty beck which you can pick up just to the east of the Minster and train station. The path runs for just under a mile until it joins with the River Hull. Here you can extend the walk by following riverside paths south toward Woodmansey or north to Tickton. See our River Hull Walk for more details on this. On the way you'll enjoy the tranquil waters of the beck, flanked by attractive woodland and new housing. At the eastern end you'll come to the lock gates near its junction with the River Hull. The lock gates and pumping station were restored in early 2007 and make for a nice photo. At the end of the beck the route heads back towards the town centre on the same paths. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Beverley Twenty long distance circular walk and explore the countryside surrounding the town.",
