The origin of its name is uncertain, but Ekwall suggests that it likely signifies \"the village of Ealdhere's people\". Interestingly, any resemblance to Aldeburgh is coincidental or stems from assimilation. The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not mention a specific manor in Aldringham. However, it does reference two estates. One of these estates, included in the assessment of Leiston, fell within the jurisdiction of the bishop at Hoxne. It was leased by Robert Malet and comprised seven villeins and a bordar, cultivating 90 acres of land. The other estate consisted of 20 acres and half a ploughteam, also under the tenure of Robert Malet."

      "caption": "The Parrot and Punchbowl. The pub in Aldringham-cum-Thorpe, believed to have been constructed around 1576, holds the distinction of being the oldest building in the parish. Originally named \"The Case is Altered,\" it underwent a renaming in 1604 under the ownership of the Kemp family. Notably, the pub was featured in \"The History of Signboards, From the Earliest Times to the Present Day,\" published in 1866 by English bibliophile and publisher John Camden Hotten, along with Dutch author Jacob Larwood. The book highlights the addition of punchbowls to pub signboards by the late seventeenth century, symbolising \"political prestige.\" Punch, favored by the Whigs, served as a form of \"party badge\" for pubs during this period. With a rich history intertwined with smuggling activities, Aldringham was a notable hub for smuggling during the 17th and 18th centuries, with the pub playing a significant role. Records show that in 1778, authorities arrested two smugglers on the premises. An account from 1892 by Leiston local Lewis Chandler, documented on the Parrot's website in 2004, sheds light on a major smuggling incident. Chandler recounted a significant arrest involving the confiscation of twelve horses, six carts, and three hundred tubs of gin. The seized alcohol was emptied outside the pub, prompting locals to create a sump hole to collect it in pails. Tragically, one individual succumbed to the effects of consuming contaminated alcohol within 24 hours."
