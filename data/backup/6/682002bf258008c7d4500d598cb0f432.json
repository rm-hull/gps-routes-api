  "description": "This historic castle is located in the beautiful River Boyne Valley of County Meath. The castle grounds make for a fine little walk with footpaths to follow through Little Glen Wood and down to the river which flows along the southern edge of the site. Slane also includes a natural amphitheatre where many popular concerts and other events have been held. The circular trail starts at the car park taking you past the 18th century fortification and the distillery where Slane Irish Whiskey is brewed and matured. Guided tours are available at both these sites. You can continue your walking in the area along the Boyne Valley Walk. This takes you from Navan to Knowth along the riverside and canal towpaths that run through the area. At the eastern end of the route you will find another local historic highlight at Knowth. The noteworthy ancient site contains around one-third of all known megalithic art in western Europe.",
