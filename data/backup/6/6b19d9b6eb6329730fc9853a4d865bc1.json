  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll along the Basingstoke Canal on this pleasant walk in the village of Odiham. The historic village is located in the in the Hart district of Hampshire, near to the town of Fleet. The route includes a visit to the ruins of Odiham Castle which are located next to the canal. Start the walk from the car park off London Road next to Colt Hill Wharf. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it west to Warnborough Green where you can take a small detour to visit the River Whitewater, which runs just to the north of the canal. The route continues to the castle which was built by King John in the early part of the 13th century. The King rode from the site to Runnymede, to seal the Magna Carte in 1215. The now ruined castle is still an impressive sight with the tower keep and moat a protected ancient monument. The walk continues to Greywell where you can stop for refreshments at the cafe before returning to Odiham. To continue your walking in the village head to the nearby Dogmersfield Park. The walk starts from the same car park but heads east along the canal to visit Dogmersfield Lake, Odiham Common and the pretty Tundry Pond.",

      "content": "The Crondall Walk visits the village from the neighbouring settlement. The village includes a noteworthy Norman church and a fine 500 year old pub. The Three Castles Path passes the castle. This historically themed long distance trail will take you from Windsor Castle to Winchester Castle, visiting several of the local walking highlights on the way. On the southern side of nearby Basingstoke there's the historic area of Old Basing. Here you'll find the 16th century Basing House, a Tudor Tithe Barn, Basingstoke Common and the Basing Lime Pits. There's also some more nice trails along the River Loddon in this area. Just south of Old Basing there's also Hackwood Park to explore. The Grade I listed park has a series of public footpaths taking you past the old estate which includes an ornamental bridge, fountains, a statue of George I, deer and the impressive Hackwood House. Just to the east of the park you can pick up the circular Mapledurwell Walk and visit the pretty villages of Mapledurwell and Upton Grey. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
