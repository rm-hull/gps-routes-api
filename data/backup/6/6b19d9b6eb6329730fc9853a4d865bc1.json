  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll along the Basingstoke Canal on this pleasant walk in the village of Odiham. The historic village is located in the in the Hart district of Hampshire, near to the town of Fleet. The route includes a visit to the ruins of Odiham Castle which are located next to the canal. Start the walk from the car park off London Road next to Colt Hill Wharf. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it west to Warnborough Green where you can take a small detour to visit the River Whitewater, which runs just to the north of the canal. The route continues to the castle which was built by King John in the early part of the 13th century. The King rode from the site to Runnymede, to seal the Magna Carte in 1215. The now ruined castle is still an impressive sight with the tower keep and moat a protected ancient monument. The walk continues to Greywell where you can stop for refreshments at the cafe before returning to Odiham. To continue your walking in the village head to the nearby Dogmersfield Park . The walk starts from the same car park but heads east along the canal to visit Dogmersfield Lake, Odiham Common and the pretty Tundry Pond.",
