  "description": "This walk explores the Spelga Reservoir in the Mourne Mountains of County Down. Park at the Deer Meadow car park at the southern end of the lake to start your walk. From here you head north to the water where it's then possible to follow the lake shore for some distance on foot, although the footpaths are not surfaced so good footwear is required. There's terrific views over the water to the surrounding mountains. You could also park at the Spelga Dam car park at the northern end of the water. There is a nice picnic area with a short walking trail here. When there's been a dry period the Spelga Dam runs low in water unveiling old roads and bridges that have been buried for a long time. Mourne Way long distance trail runs past the northern end of the water. You can pick up the path to climb Butter Mountain. To the west of the reservoir there are paths up to Hen and Cock Mountain, where you can enjoy fine views over the area. Another lovely reservoir can also be reached from Spelga Dam. Heading south east along the Mourne Wall Challenge Walk will take you to Silent Valley Reservoir . There's lovely woodland trails to follow along the River Kilkeel with smaller ornamental lakes to enjoy as well. Just to the north of the Silent Valley there's Ben Crom Reservoir with its impressive dam wall and trails up to the pretty Blue Lough .",
