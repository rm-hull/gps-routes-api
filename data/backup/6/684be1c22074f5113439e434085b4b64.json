  "description": "This walk takes you to Kinder Reservoir from Hayfield along the Snake Path. The reservoir is very pretty with the backdrop of woodland, fields and Peak District hills. The walk starts in Hayfield where you will find the Snake Path turning on your left as you leave the village. You then follow it for about 2 miles to the reservoir where there is a footpath along the water. Follow the path up to William Clough for great views over the water. You could extend the walk and continue up William Clough and then pick up the Pennine Way and follow it to Kinder Scout. Our circular walk to Kinder Downfall also passes the reservoir. It will take you to the tallest waterfall in the Peak District from Hayfield.",
