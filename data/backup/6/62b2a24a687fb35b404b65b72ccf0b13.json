  "description": "This circular walk explores the Mallerstang area of Cumbria. The narrow river valley is an interesting place for a hike with some dramatic scenery including old lime kilns, becks, waterfalls and hill views. Also look out for the \"Eden Benchmarks\", a series of carved stone sculptures dotted around the area. The walk starts from the car parking area at the atmospheric ruins of the ancient Pendragon Castle. From here you can pick up the Lady Anne's Way long distance walk and follow it south through the region. The bridle tracks and footpaths will take you to Hell Gill where you can enjoy views of the Hellgill Force waterfall. The route then turns north following trails running along the old Settle to Carilise Railway. To continue your walking around Mallerstang head up to Wild Boar Fell. It's a popular climb with fabulous views over the Eden Valley and the Mallerstang Valley from the summit.",
