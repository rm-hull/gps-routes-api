  "description": "Climb to the highest point in Wensleydale on this popular walking route in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The route begins at the village of Hardraw near to the lovely Hardraw Force Walk waterfalls. It then follows the Pennine Way National Trail to the fell top which lies about 4.5 miles north of the village. As such the path is well defined and way-marked. The route continues along the trail to Thwaite where there is an old bridge and some waterfalls. You can turn it into a circular walk by following the Cliff Gate Road south if you prefer. There are fabulous views from the summit of Wensleydale to the south, Ribblesdale to the south west and Swaledale to the north, as well as views into Cumbria and County Durham. To extend your walking in this lovely area you could pick up the 10 mile Hawes Circular Walk which takes you on a tour of the rivers, becks, waterfalls and hills surrounding the town.",
