  "description": "This Essex based market town has some interesting old buildings and nice country trails to follow through the area. This walk from the town takes you along the Flitch Way to Hatfield Forest. The walk starts in the town where you can pick up the Flitch Way, a shared cycling and walking trail running along a disused railway line. Follow the waymarked trail west and it will take you to Canfield End and Takeley. Here you can pick up a section of the Harcamlow Way and follow it south west to enter the expansive Hatfield Forest Country Park. There's miles of cycling and walking trails here with attractive woodland, ponds and a visitor centre. The route heads north through the forest past the Portingbury Hills along the Forest Way before rejoining the Flitch Way. You can then follow the trail east back into Great Dunmow.",
