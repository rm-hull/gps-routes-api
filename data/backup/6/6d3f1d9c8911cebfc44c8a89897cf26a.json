  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Moray Coast Trail from Hopeman to Burghead. Part of the route uses a dismantled railway line some of which can also be used for cycling. Along the way there's nice views of the beaches, harbours and sandstone rocks of the area. The route runs for just over 2 miles on a fairly easy path. You can start off from the public sea front car park at Hopeman. Then pick up the trail and head west towards Cummingston where you will pass the Natural Arches. The final section takes you past St Aethan's Well before coming to into Burghead where the walk finishes. To continue your walking along the trail you can pick up the next leg on the Findhorn to Burghead Walk . The previous leg will take you from Hopeman to Lossiemouth .",
