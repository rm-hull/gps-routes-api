  "description": "This coastal village is located in a lovely spot just south of Dolgellau , Barmouth and Fairbourne on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park. It's a beautiful place surrounded by steep hills and and green fields. This walk from the village takes you north along the Afon Gwril to the Llwyngwril beach on the coast. Here you can enjoy some splendid views to Cardigan Bay where dolphins can often be spotted. The Wales coast path runs through the village. You could pick this up and follow it south to Tywyn or north towards Barmouth.",
