  "description": "Enjoy a short circular walk around this delightful coastal nature reserve in Brixham, Devon. The reserve has a good sized parking area at the end of St Mary's Road in Higher Brixham. From here you can pick up the footpaths to take you to Sharkham Point and along the coastal headland. It's a great viewpoint with nice views down to St Mary's beach and along the coast. The area is fantastic for wildlife watching with ospreys in the skies above and dolphins in the beautiful turquoise waters below. To extend your walk follow the South West Coast Path north around St Mary's Bay to the splendid Berry Head Country Park . Here you can see a wide variety of coastal plantlife and a large Guillemot colony. It's about a 1.5 mile walk from Berry Head to Sharkham Point along the coastal path.",
