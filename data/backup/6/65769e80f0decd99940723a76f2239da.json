He was sailing-master of the \"Cinque Ports\" but believing the ship was unseaworthy quarrelled with the captain and was put ashore on Juan Fernandez Island in the Pacific where he remained marooned for 4 years before being rescued. The house that now stands at his birthplace on 99-105 Main Street features a life-sized statue of Selkirk wearing self-made goatskin clothes, scanning the horizon. A signpost at the harbour points to\u00a0Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, some 7,500 miles distant."

  "description": "This walk takes you along a section of the Fife Coastal Path from Lower Large to Elie via Shell Bay. The route runs for about 7 miles along a fairly flat section of the path. Along the way there are some stunning coastal views and lots of wildfowl to look out for. Start off at the harbour in the ancient fishing village of Lower Largo and follow the waymarked footpath east to Temple Hill. You continue along the beaches of Largo Bay before coming to the picturesque cove at Shell Bay. There's a pretty beach with rock pools, holiday caravans and old WW2 bunkers to see. The final section runs past Kincraig Hill to Earlsferry before finishing at Elie Harbour. You can extend the walk by continuing east on the Elie to Pittenweem Walk . You could also enjoy a peaceful walk around Kilconquhar Loch which lies just to the north of the path.",
