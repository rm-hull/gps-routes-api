  "description": "Follow the Stover Canal from Newton Abbot to Teigngrace on this short walk in South Devon. It's a nice easy stroll along a section of the Templer Way with the option to continue on to Stover Country Park where there's some nice woodland trails and a lovely lake. At the Newton Abbot end of the canal you can follow a waterside path along the River Teign to extend your walk. The canal forms part of the Stover Cycle Path which runs from Newton Abbot to Bovey Tracey along a traffic free path.",

Here you can pick up the circular Chudleigh Walk and visit some of the highlights of the area including Chudleigh Rocks, Ugbrooke Park and the Castle Dyke Iron Age Hillfort. In Newton Abbot you could pay a visit to Decoy Country Park. There's a Wildlife Discovery Centre, Nature Reserve and a watersports centre next to the lake here. Near the park you can pick up the River Lemon Walk to Bickington. The pleasant riverside trail will take you pass the National Trust's Bradley Manor which you can find on the western side of Newton Abbot. The medieval limestone manor house has an interesting history and some pleasant trails through the adjacent Bradley Woods. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
