  "description": "Follow the Stover Canal from Newton Abbot to Teigngrace on this short walk in South Devon. It's a nice easy stroll along a section of the Templer Way with the option to continue on to Stover Country Park where there's some nice woodland trails and a lovely lake. At the Newton Abbot end of the canal you can follow a waterside path along the River Teign to extend your walk. The canal forms part of the Stover Cycle Path which runs from Newton Abbot to Bovey Tracey along a traffic free path.",
