  "description": "Visit historical religous sites on this fascinating walk through the South Lakeland area of Cumbria. The path starts at the train station at Grange Over Sands and takes you to Cark via Eggerslack Wood and Cartmel with its interesting priory founded in 1190. At Cark you can catch the train over Cartmel sands to Ulverston. It is possible to walk this section over the sands but this is not advised unless you are with an expert guide. At Ulverston the path heads south to Urswick, leading you around the lovely Urswick Tarn and the fascinating Birkrigg Common with its ancient stone circle and wonderful views over the Furness Peninsuala. You continue on through Dalton-in-Furness where you can visit the historic Dalton Castle which is owned by the National Trust. The route then passes the delightful Abbotswood Nature Reserve before arriving at Furness Abbey in Barrow in Furness. This ruined former Cistercian monastery dates back to 1123 and is one of the major highlights on the path. The final section takes you south to the coast where you finish on Roa Island at the southernmost point of the Furness Peninsula.",
