  "description": "Explore the Roman Fort and enjoy a stroll along the\u00a0River Waveney on this short walk in Norfolk. The fort dates from the 3rd century and still has some of its thick walls in tact. The area around the fort is also very beautiful with nice views across the Norfolk Broads to Breydon Water and the River Yare. You can start the walk from the free car park on Butt Lane. Then pick up the good footpaths through the site to the river where you can enjoy a waterside stroll. There's also helpful information boards at the site which detail the interesting history of the area.",
