  "description": "This is a nice easy cycling and walking path that follows a disused railway line from Brandon, near Durham to Bishop Auckland. You will pass through the villages of Brancepeth and Willington, shortly before joining the River Wear for the final stretch into Bishop Auckland. There are fine views of the surrounding countryside and of the Newton Cap Viaduct just before entering Bishop Auckland. The Lanchester Valley Walk and the Deerness Valley Way pass close to the trail. They are also rail trails with more great views to enjoy.",

In nearby Spennymoor you could visit Whitworth Hall Country Park and enjoy afternoon tea at the old country house. There's also lovely parkland and gardens to explore with a large herd of deer you can hand feed."
