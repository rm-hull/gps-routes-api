Trees were felled in the 1930's and damaged again during World War Two when it was used as a vast ammunition dump. Today the woodland is back to its former character and is designated a local nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. This photograph taken in May shows the bluebells in the wood."

  "description": "This woodland area near Tandridge is popular with walkers in spring when there are carpets of pretty bluebells and a nice woodland pond to see. There are a number of trails to follow around the woods with the option of extending your walk into the adjacent Great Earls Wood and Merle Common. You can enjoy refreshment at the nearby Royal Oak Pub after your walk. There is a car park at the woods but if you wanted to visit the woods by train you could follow the Eden Valley Walk and the Vanguard Way from Edenbridge towards the woods. The woods are run by Surrey Wildlife Trust and this circular walk runs for about 1 mile.",
