  "description": "Follow the Templer Way from Haytor on Dartmoor to the seaport of Teignmouth via Newton Abbot. The walk includes a wooded section through Yarner Woods near the route start and also visits the delightful Stover Country Park. With 14 acres of woodland, heathland, grassland, lake and marsh and a substantial variety of wildlife it is a real highlight on the walk. Shortly after passing Newton Abbot you will join the River Teign for a beautiful waterside section that leads to the finish point at Teignmouth. The walk is named after the Templer family who constructed the Stover Canal and Tramway to transport granite from Haytor Quarry to the coast at Teignmouth.",

The inn has a lot of character with a cosy interior and a nice sunny beer garden to relax in on warmer days. There's a very good menu and an on-site restaurant featuring local meat, game and fish. The Rock also has a free car park and is dog friendly with a separate dining area where you can eat with your dog. They provide good quality accommodation too, if you need to stay over. It's a popular place for walkers to go after climbing Hound Tor and Haytor being located just a short distance from both. Postcode for your sat navs is TQ13 9XP."
