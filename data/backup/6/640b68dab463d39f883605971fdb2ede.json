  "description": "Follow the Templer Way from Haytor on Dartmoor to the seaport of Teignmouth via Newton Abbot. The walk includes a wooded section through Yarner Woods near the route start and also visits the delightful Stover Country Park. With 14 acres of woodland, heathland, grassland, lake and marsh and a substantial variety of wildlife it is a real highlight on the walk. Shortly after passing Newton Abbot you will join the River Teign for a beautiful waterside section that leads to the finish point at Teignmouth. The walk is named after the Templer family who constructed the Stover Canal and Tramway to transport granite from Haytor Quarry to the coast at Teignmouth.",
