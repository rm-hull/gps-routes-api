  "description": "Explore the fascinating 1800 year old walls on this circular walk around this classic Roman city. Over 80% of the original structure has withstood the test of time and virtually the whole of the circuit is publicly accessible. The trail runs for about 1.5 miles with waymarks and information boards detailing the history of the city, dotted along the route. The trail passes many of Chichester's highlights such as Priory Park and the pretty Bishop's Palace Gardens. There's also great views over the city and the cathedral from the elevated position of the walls. Other highlights include the Oxmarket Centre of Arts in a 13th century building and the Market Cross which has stood in the centre of the city since 1501. The cross is a great place to start your walk, with easy access to the walls along either North, West, South or East Street. To continue your walking in the Chichester area you can enjoy an easy waterside walk along the Chichester Canal or visit the beautiful Chichester Harbour .",
