The walk takes you through the beautiful Isle of Wight countryside and heads through the pretty villages of Godshill, Newchurch and Brading. The trail passes ancient manor houses at Morton and Great Budbridge, and also includes six trail side sculptures by local artist Paul Mason. This is a nice, flat easy waterside walk with plenty to see on the trail.",
