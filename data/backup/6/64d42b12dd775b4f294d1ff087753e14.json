  "description": "This walk visits Yordas Cave in Kingsdale, North Yorkshire. Walkers can explore the cave which includes a large main chamber with a waterfall and a stream running through it. It is damp and dark inside so good waterproof footwear and a torch are required. After exploring the cave this circular walk visits a series of other nearby pot hole caves. You can follow the Turbary Road south to Jingling Pot and Turbary Pot with some fine views over Kingsdale's splendid limestone landscape on the way. Just to the west of the cave you could extend the walk by climbing to Gragareth. The hill is notable as the second highest point in Lancashire and includes more caves and a series of cairns known as the Three Men of Gragareth. At the southern end of the walk you will come close to the wonderful Ingleton Falls, one of the major highlights of the area.",
