  "description": "This delightful riverside village is a great base for exploring the beautiful Ceiriog Valley in north-east Wales. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Upper Ceiriog Trail and the Llwybr Ceiriog Trail to explore the countryside and hills surrounding the settlement. The walk starts in the village and heads west to pick up the Llwybr Ceiriog Trail. Follow the trails south and it will take you to Pandy where you can cross the River Ceiriog and enjoy views of the River Tierw. You continue past Springhill Wood and Pen Y Gwely Hill before coming to the pretty Pen Y Gwely Reservoir. Near here you turn north to Llechrydrau, Bedwlwyn and Llwynmawr where you cross the river again. You continue past Pontadog before passing the Weather Station and Finger Farm. Just south of here you will return to the village.",

      "content": "Just to the east of the trail you could visit the historic Chirk Castle. There's also the Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog Walk which uses sections of the upper trail to create an alternative circular walk through the area. A few miles to the north east there's a major local highlight at the impressive Pontcysyllte Aqueduct. To the north west are Carrog and Corwen where a number of long distance walking trails can be picked up. Head west and you can pick up the Nant Y Pandy Walk. This will take you along the scenic little river to nearby Glyndyfrdwy."
