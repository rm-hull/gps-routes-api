  "description": "This delightful riverside village is a great base for exploring the beautiful Ceiriog Valley\u00a0in north-east Wales. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Upper Ceiriog Trail and the Llwybr Ceiriog Trail to explore the countryside and hills surrounding the settlement. The walk starts in the village and heads west to pick up the Llwybr Ceiriog Trail. Follow the trails south and it will take you to Pandy where you can cross the River Ceiriog and enjoy views of the River Tierw. You continue past Springhill Wood and Pen Y Gwely Hill before coming to the pretty Pen Y Gwely Reservoir. Near here you turn north to Llechrydrau, Bedwlwyn and Llwynmawr where you cross the river again. You continue past Pontadog before passing the Weather Station and Finger Farm. Just south of here you will return to the village.",
