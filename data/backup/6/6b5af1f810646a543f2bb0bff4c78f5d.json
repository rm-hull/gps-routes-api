  "description": "This circular walk from Eltham uses part of the Green Chain Walk to take you to Eltham Palace, Beckenham Place Park and Elmstead Woods. The route runs for about 10 miles and includes a few small climbs on the way. The walk starts at Eltham Palace where you can pick up the Green Chain Walk in the park. The fine 1930s house is surrounded by 19 acres of award-winning gardens and a moat. The English Heritage run site also includes a medieval palace with a glorious hammer-beam roof built for Edward IV five hundred years ago. You can follow the waymarked path south from the palace and it will take you past Mottingham to Elmstead Woods. After exploring the woods the path heads west to Sundridge and Plaistow before coming to Beckenham Place Park. In the park you'll find 96 hectares (237 acres) of parkland including river trails along the Ravensbourne River, ancient woodland, a sensory garden and a Grade II listed mansion. From the park you head east, crossing the Ravensbourne River before passing through Downham. The final section runs past Catford and Grove Park where you cross the Quaggy River at Mottingham. Shortly after you pass Mottingham Farm and return to Eltham Palace where the route finishes.",
