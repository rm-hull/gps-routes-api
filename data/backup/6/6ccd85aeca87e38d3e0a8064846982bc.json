  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Glenoe Waterfall in the hamlet of Glenoe in County Antrim. It's a fine place for a walk with pleasant trails taking you through peaceful woodland to the 30ft high waterfall. The National Trust owned area includes a car park and the church of St. Columbas. It's a brief stroll from the pretty settlement of Glenoe, with pathways winding their way around the small, verdant glen. Eventually you will come to one of Northern Ireland's most picturesque waterfalls nestled within the valley. The well-marked walk features numerous steps, meandering along the sides of the lush valley and the delightful Glenoe Water. A favoured spot for photographers, it is now included in the official Causeway Coastal Driving Route. Starting from the car park, the trail leads through wooded areas, branching out into a network of pathways and steps, guiding adventurers across varying terrain. The ground may be uneven and steep, owing to the deep gorge, and damp underfoot due to flowing water and mist.",
