  "description": "Enjoy a walk around the beautiful grounds of Melford Hall in Suffolk. The hall has been the family home of the Hyde Parker family since the 1780s. Cousins to Beatrix Potter she regularly visited the hall and some of her sketches and watercolours can be viewed inside. There are also several grand rooms to explore with collections of naval paintings, Tudor portraits and Chinese porcelain. In the grounds there are beautiful landscaped gardens, a croquet lawn and the impressive 15th-century Holy Trinity church. Kentwell Hall is very close by so is a good option if you would like to extend your outing. You could also pick up the St Edmund Way and follow it east to the delightful village of Lavenham . You could also pick up the Sudbury Railway Walk and follow it south from Melford Country Park and Sudbury with its delightful water meadows.",
