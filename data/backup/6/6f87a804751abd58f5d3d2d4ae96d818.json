  "description": "Explore this fascinating carboniferous limestone gorge on this circular walk in the Mendip Hills AONB. The site is geologically significant with numerous caves, cliffs and interesting rock formations. There is also an Iron Age univallate hill fort known as Burrington Camp and a variety of plants to look out for including Rock-rose, Wild Thyme and Wood Sage. Look out for mountain goats on the precarious cliff edges. The goats were introduced to the area to help reduce scrub and unwanted plants, so preserving the natural habitat. You can start your walk at the car park next to the Rock of Ages on the eastern side of the Coombe. You then climb east across the site reaching a height of nearly 700ft. From the high points there are magnificent views over the Mendips. The area is also popular with mountain bikers with some good trails up to Beacon Batch. To extend your walk you can head west to Mendip Lodge Wood and Dolebury Warren on the Limestone Link. It's a lovely area with an Iron Age hill fort, wildflowers, butterflies and splendid views across North Somerset and the Mendips. Just to the south west you will find miles of woodland trails in Rowberrow Warren Wood. This is another good place for mountain bikers. The West Mendip Way also runs through the southern section of the wood so you can pick this up and head to Shipham. You could also visit the nearby Blagdon Lake where there is a nice waterside footpath at the northern end of the water. The climb to Beacon Batch on Black Down hill starts from the car park. The hill is the highest point in the Mendips and provides great views over the lake.",
