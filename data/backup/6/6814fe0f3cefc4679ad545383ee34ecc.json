  "description": "This circular walk near Ironbridge visits the Shropshire village of Benthall and the historic Benthall Hall. Start the walk from Benthall village where you can pick up footpaths heading north west to the National Trust's Hall. The fine 16th century house is surrounded by parkland and pretty gardens. On the site you'll find a restored plantsman's garden, an old kitchen garden and interesting Restoration church. You can also tour the fine house and learn all about the\u00a0family history which dates back to the doomsday book. After exploring the hall head north west to enter Benthall Edge Wood where you can pick up Severn Way . Follow the waymarked trail east along the River Severn and it will take you to the famous Ironbridge over the river. At the bridge you turn south to follow country lanes and footpaths back to Benthall.",
