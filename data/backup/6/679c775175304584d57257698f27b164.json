The dunes are home to over 250 species of plants and animals, including marram grass, sea holly, and sand couch, which play a crucial role in stabilising the dunes. These plant species provide habitat for various invertebrates, notably several scarce moth species such as the Sand Dart (Agrostis ripae), Shore Wainscot (Mythimna litoralis), and White Colon (Sideridis albicon). The area is also significant for birdlife, serving as an important site for wintering birds, with species like the sanderling and ringed plover frequently observed along the shoreline."

A large section of the western end of the dunes lies within the Camber Sands and Rye Saltings Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), while the rest is designated a Site of Nature Conservation Importance. The dunes are getting larger by accretion. The beach has been used as a film location on many occassions. For example in the 1958 film Dunkirk starring John Mills it was used to recreate Operation Dynamo. They were used again as Normandy beaches during D-Day in the 1962 epic The Longest Day."
