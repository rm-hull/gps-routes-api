  "description": "This circular walk takes you along a popular section of the South West Coast Path from Gorran Haven To Mevagissey via Portmellon. There's some wonderful coast and countryside views as you make your way along the cliff top path in the glorious Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Starting in the public car park in Gorran Haven you pick up the coastal path and follow it north east to Great Perhaver Beach and Turbot Point before coming to Portmellon Cove. There is a sandy beach here where you can explore the rock pools at low tide. You can also look out for seals swimming off the beach or resting on the rocks. From Portmellon you continue north to the fishing village of Mevagissey. Here you can enjoy a stroll around the picturesque harbour and the interesting narrow streets with old shops and pretty cottages to see. Just north west of here you could take a detour to visit the stunning Lost Gardens of Heligan . This route then returns inland through the countryside, passing Galowras Mill, Sanctuary Wood and the village of Gorran Churchtown on the way back to Gorran Haven.",
