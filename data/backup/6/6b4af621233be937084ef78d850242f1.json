  "description": "Travel from Lancaster Castle to Richmond Castle on this lovely walk through Lancashire and Yorkshire. You will travel through the lower Lower Lune Valley with a long riverside section at the start.  You then head through the moorlands and fells of the Pennines and on into the valleys of the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Finally, you follow the River Swale into the historic market town of Richmond - gateway to the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The walk passes Ingleton (with the wonderful Ingleton Falls ), Ribblehead Viaduct and the picturesque Yorkshire village of Hawes. Other highlights include the historic Easby Abbey and the 14th century castle at Castle Bolton .",
