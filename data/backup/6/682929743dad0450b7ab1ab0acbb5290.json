  "description": "This circular walk takes you along the River Spey in the town of Grantown On Spey in the county of Moray. The walk starts on Spey Bridge just to the south of the town. From here you can pick up a riverside footpath heading east to the Old Spey Bridge. You then cross to the other side along the Speyside Way long distance trail. You can follow this shared cycling and walking trail west along the old railway line to the river where you can pick up another riverside footpath. Follow this north east and it will return you to the bridge. You can continue the walk by heading into the surrounding Anagach Woods on the northern side of the river. The pinewoods are a good place to look out for wildlife including Capercaillie and red squirrels. If you follow the Speyside Way south west you could enjoy more waterside walking around Loch Vaa and Loch Garten. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Grantown On Spey. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
