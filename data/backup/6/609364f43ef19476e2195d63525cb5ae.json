  "description": "This East Sussex town is in a good location for exploring the High Weald AONB on foot. It's also located very close to the lovely Bewl Water and the expansive Bedgebury Forest, which are both great places for walkers. This circular walk from the town takes you around Bewl Water, running for a distance of just over 13 miles and using a mixture of waymarked trails, public footpaths and quiet country lanes. The reservoir is a great place for wildlife spotting so be sure to bring your binoculars. Birds you may spot include Goldcrests, Long Tailed Tits, Wagtails, Skylarks and Lapwings in the woodland. Also look out for Kingfishers, Herons and the Great Crested Grebe on the water. The walk starts from the car park in the town centre and then follows footpaths north east through the countryside to the lake. Here you pick up the Sussex Border Path to take you around the northern and eastern side of the water. You'll pass Chingley Wood and come close to Bedgebury Forest on the eastern side. On the southern side, public footpaths and country lanes takes you past Tolhurst before returning to the towb. To extend your walking in the area you could head to the National Trust's Scotney Castle. There's 770 acres of woodland and parkland surrounding the 14th century moated castle near Tunbridge Wells. Near here you can also pick up the historic Lamberhurst Walk which visits the noteworthy Bayham Old Abbey. The site is run by English Heritage and includes substantial ruins dating back to the 13th century.",
