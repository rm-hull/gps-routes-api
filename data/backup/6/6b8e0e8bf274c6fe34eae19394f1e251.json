Increasing demand in the city meant additional water had to be extracted from the River Eden. Today the reservoir supplies water to the area north and east of Carlisle, as far as the border with Scotland, and is a supplementary source for Carlisle and Caldbeck."

      "caption": "Culverted beck alongside the reservoir. Castle Carrock is a storage reservoir - the water is piped by gravity from streams and springs in Geltsdale, 3 or 4km away. The source was chosen for its purity, but from a geological point of view the most suitable place to build a reservoir was in the valley of the Castle Carrock Beck. The beck that was originally here flowed through agricultural land, so not good for drinking water. The solution was to divert it through an underground culvert around the edge of the reservoir. This photo shows a small section which is uncovered, before the culvert goes underneath the dam. The beck comes out beside the water works , then continues as normal round the edge of Castle Carrock village."

  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir in the Carlisle District of Cumbria. The trail runs for about 2 miles on a series of fairly flat footpaths. The walk starts from the village of Castle Carrock where you can follow footpaths south to reach the reservoir. You can then follow trails around the water and through the surrounding woodland. It's a very pretty and peaceful area with woodland birds to look out for on the way round. For a more challenging walk you could climb to the fells above the reservoir on the eastern side. The footpaths run south from the village to Nixon Head, Tottergill Farm and Roughet Hill. There are fine views over the area from this elevated path.",
