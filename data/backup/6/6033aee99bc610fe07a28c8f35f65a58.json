  "description": "This picturesque East Sussex based village is surrounded by some lovely High Weald countryside. This circular walk from the village visits the National Trust's Bateman's, just to the south west of the settlement. The fine 17th century Jacobean house was the home of author Rudyard Kipling during the early part of the 20th century. You can explore the house and the surrounding gardens with views of the High Weald countryside to enjoy on the way. The walk starts at the car park in the village centre and heads east along the High Street before turning south along Bateman's Lane. This will lead you to the fine country house which you can explore for a fee. The route then heads east towards Dudwell Farm which is located close to the Dudwell River. You then turns north to return to the village.",
