  "description": "Climb to the highest point in the Cranborne Chase AONB and enjoy wonderful views over Shaftesbury , Salisbury Plain , Glastonbury Tor , the Mendips, the Quantocks, the Purbecks and the south coast. There is a National Trust car park near the hill summit. You can park here and follow footpaths up to the 277 metres (909 ft) high point and enjoy the panoramic views over the beautiful surrounding coutryside. The summit has a distinctive look with a clump of beech trees growing on a Bronze Age bowl barrow. In the summer months you will find many interesting plants and flowers on the rich downland of the hill. There's also a handy toposcope which details all the landmarks you can see from the summit. You could extend your walk by continuing south along the Wessex Ridgeway to Tollard Royal via Ashcombe Bottom. As an alternative you could start the walk from the village of Tollard Royal and visit the hill from there. Also just to the west you will find Fontmell and Melbury Downs nature reserve where there's fine views and interesting flora and fauna.",
