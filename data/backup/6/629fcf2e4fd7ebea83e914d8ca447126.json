  "description": "This walk visits the Codnor Park Reservoir in Derbyshire. There's a good sized car park on the southern side of the water where you can pick up a nice waterside trail. You can extend the walk by continuing west to visit the fascinating Midland Railway Centre. Here you can enjoy the old steam trains, explore a delightful 35 acre country park and stroll along more waterside trails at Butterley Reservoir. The Cromford Canal runs past in both directions as well. The Codnor Park and Butterley Park reservoirs provided water to the canal.",
