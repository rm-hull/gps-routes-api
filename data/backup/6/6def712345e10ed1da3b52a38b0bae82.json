  "description": "This super figure of eight trail takes you on a tour of the stunning northern area of the Cotswolds. The route runs for a distance of just over 40 miles. The walk begins at the lovely town of Winchcombe and heads to Dumbleton via Gretton and Alderton. At Dumbleton you turn south over Dumbleton Hill and through Alstone toward Cleeve Hill and Common. Cleeve Hill is the highest point both of the Cotswolds hill range and in the county of Gloucestershire, at 1083 ft. Here you will also find Belas Knap neolithic chambered long barrow. A scheduled ancient monument in the care of English Heritage, it has been described as an 'outstanding example representing a group of long barrows commonly referred to as the Cotswold-Severn group'. Shortly after Belas Knap you return to Winchcombe where the next section of the walk takes to Temple Guiting, passing through Guiting Wood on the way. The path continues to Snowshill where you can explore the delightful Snowshill Manor. Here you can view Charles Wade's collection of 'colour, craftsmanship and design' and enjoy the beautiful hillside gardens. From Stanshill you continue through Buckland and Stanton before coming to another major route highlight at Stanway House. This splendid Jacobean manor house is right on the trail and open to the public. There are also beautiful gardens and a 300ft high fountain which is the tallest gravity fountain in the world. The final section of the walk takes you back to Winchcombe, passing Didbrook and the National Trust owned Hailes Abbey with its 13th century ruins and excellent museum.",
