The timber framed building has some interesting history such as when it hosted Cromwell\u2019s troops in the English Civil War, and when Blitz-affected Coventry citizens slept on its ancient wooden floors during the second World War. There's a charming interior with ancient oak beams, log fires and private nooks and crannies. Outside there's a lovely garden area for warmer days.Shakespeare refers to Warwick\u2019s emblem \u2018The rampant bear chain\u2019d to the ragged staff\u2019 in Henry VI, and a giant wooden bear climbing a pole can still be seen outside the pub today. They serve a fine Sunday roast and can be found at Spencer's Lane with postcode CV7 7BB for your sat navs."
