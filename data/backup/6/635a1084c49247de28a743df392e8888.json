  "description": "This village near Coventry has a number of good waymarked footpaths to try. The historic village also includes some notable features including a Norman church, a Grade II listed 16th century inn and the Berkswell Windmill which dates back to 1826. There's also a pretty village green and some picturesque thatched cottages to admire in this delightful settlement.

The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Heart of England Way and follow the waymarked footpath north past Berkswell Hall to Blind Hall Farm. The route then continues to the neighbouring village of Meriden where you will pass Meriden House and Hall. The village is also notable as the geographical centre of England Here you can pick up the Warwickshire Millennium Way and follow the trail east towards Millison's Wood before turning south to Flint's Green and Benton Green.
