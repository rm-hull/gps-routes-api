  "description": "This walk visits Smiddy Shaw Reservoir on Muggleswick Common near Consett in County Durham. There's a nice gravel footpath running around the reservoir with fine views across the water to the surrounding fields. You can start the walk from the public car park located at the eastern end of the water, near to Blackpool Hill. It's easy to extend your reservoir walking by heading south to the Waskerley Reservoir Way or west to Hisehope Reservoir. Tunstall Reservoir is only a few miles to the south as well.",
