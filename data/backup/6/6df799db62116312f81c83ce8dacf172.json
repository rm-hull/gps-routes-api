Although there is no direct public access to the castle itself, the demesne offers scenic walks along the River Camcor, which flows through a pond before joining the Little Brosna River. This river marks the boundary between Counties Offaly and Tipperary and eventually flows into the Shannon."

The museum is situated within a courtyard off William Street, making it easily accessible for visitors exploring the demesne. The exhibits within the Science Centre cover a range of topics, focusing on the work of notable figures such as the 3rd and 4th Earls of Rosse. Laurence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, along with his mother, Mary Parsons, Countess of Rosse, were particularly prominent in the field of photography. The Countess's darkroom, which is preserved and on display within the museum, is believed to be the oldest surviving darkroom in the world, offering a unique glimpse into the early days of photography. In addition to the photographic history, the museum features displays on the Great Telescope and its impact on astronomy, as well as other scientific advancements made by members of the Parsons family and their associates. This makes the Ireland's Historic Science Centre a key attraction for those interested in both the history of science and the broader cultural heritage of Ireland."

This bridge is a significant piece of engineering heritage, representing early 19th-century craftsmanship. Nearby, there was also an early hydroelectric station, highlighting the innovative use of technology by the castle's residents in harnessing natural resources. In addition to these technological marvels, the castle's walled gardens are home to some remarkable horticultural features. Notably, the Box Hedges in these gardens are over 300 years old and are recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the tallest hedge in the world. These ancient hedges add to the charm and historical significance of the gardens."
