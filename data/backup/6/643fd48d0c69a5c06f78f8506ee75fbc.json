  "description": "This waymarked literary walk in the Brecon Beacons follows in the footsteps of the 17th century poet Henry Vaughan. You'll explore some of the beautiful countryside that inspired many of his poems. Along the way there are interesting information boards with more detail of his life and the features of the surrounding area. You will also pass the Vaughan Garden where you can learn about his other profession as a doctor of herbal medicine. There's more panels here with extracts from his poems as well. The circular walk starts from the village of Talybont On Usk where you begin with an easy stroll along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal. The route then heads south to link with another waterside footpath along the Caerfanell River towards Aber village where there are some fine countryside views. You'll then cross the river and pick up a section of the Taff Trail following a dismantled railway line back towards the canal and the village. This section runs along the old Brinore Tramroad and passes the Vaugn Memorial and Garden mentioned earlier. The walk is waymarked with a blue and white disc, featuring a bird in a flight. It runs for just over 2 miles and is fairly flat with some small climbs. You can continue your walk by heading south to visit Talybont Reservoir where there are some lovely waterside trails to try.",
