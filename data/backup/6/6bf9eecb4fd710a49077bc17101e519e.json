  "description": "This cycle or walk takes you around the lovely Pooley Country Park in Warwickshire. In the park you will find the Coventry Canal, a number of pretty lakes and the ruins of a Benedictine priory. The Alvecote Priory was founded in 1159 with the main entrance arch still standing at around 20 feet high. There's also Pooley Hill to climb where you can enjoy panoramic views over the surrounding area. Park facilities include a Visitor Centre & Tea Room. If you're coming from the centre of Tamworth you could follow the Coventry Canal to the park on our Tamworth Canal Walk .",
