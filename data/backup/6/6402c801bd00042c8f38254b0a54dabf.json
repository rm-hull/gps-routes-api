  "description": "This circular walk visits the impressive Harringworth Viaduct or Welland Viaduct in North Northamptonshire. On the way you'll pass the neighbouring village of Seaton and the Seaton Marshes Nature Reserve. The eastern part of the walk includes a section along the long distance Jurassic Way which runs along a particularly lovely area of the River Welland. The northern section around Seaton villages uses part of the Rutland Round , another waymarked trail running through the region. You can start and finish the walk at Harringworth village where there is a decent walker/bike friendly cafe for post walk refreshments. The route then picks up a mixture of public footpaths and country lanes to take you around the photogenic structure. The Grade II listed viaduct is about a kilometre long, and was completed in 1878. It contains 82 arches and is notable as the longest masonry viaduct across a valley in Britain. On the walk there are also some fine views of the surrounding Welland Valley countryside to enjoy.",
