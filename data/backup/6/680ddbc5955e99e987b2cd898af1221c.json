  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around the market town of Northleach. The interesting town has a 14th century church and is home to the Old Prison museum and visitor centre, also called Escape to the Cotswolds. The route makes use of the waymarked North Cotswold Diamond Way and the Monarch's Way to explore the countryside around the town and visit the neighbouring village of Farmington. Starting in the centre of town head south along the Diamond Way to Helen's Ditch. You then head east to Upper End, before turning north to Farmington. The little village has an old church, pretty cottages and a village green. At Farmington you pick up the Monarch's Way and head west back into Northleach, passing the noteworthy Eastington Manor on the way. To extend your walking in the area just head a couple of miles east and visit Sherborne Park. The National Trust owned estate includes pleasure grounds, woodland trails and a 19th century ice house.",
