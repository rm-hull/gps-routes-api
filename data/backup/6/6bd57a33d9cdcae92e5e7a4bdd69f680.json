While at the Grade I listed cottage, he completed his best known work, Paradise Lost; the seeds for Paradise Regained were also sown here. The 16th century timber framed cottage is now a museum. The four museum rooms contain the most extensive collection in the world on open display of 17th-century first editions of John Milton's works, both poetry and prose. Tours vividly describe and explore the extraordinary career of this blind genius in his refuge from the plague, where he wrote some of the finest poetry."

  "description": "This pretty Buckinghamshire village sits in a nice rural spot on the edge of the Chilterns AONB. The village is part of the 'Chalfonts' along with Chalfont St Peter and Little Chalfont. The worthy settlement includes a picturesque village green and a duck pond fed by the River Misbourne. Other highlights include the church of Saint Giles which is of Norman architecture and dates from the 12th century. The village is also notable as the former home of John Milton, author of the epic poem 'Paradise Lost'. Milton's cottage is now a open to the public as a museum and includes an extensive collection of 17th-century first editions of John Milton's works, both poetry and prose. This circular walk from the village uses a section of the South Bucks Way to take you along the River Misbourne to the neighbouring town of Amersham. The route then takes you to Coleshill village before heading to Hodgemoor Woods where there are some pleasant woodland trails to try.",
