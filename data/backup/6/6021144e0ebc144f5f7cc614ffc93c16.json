  "description": "This walk visits the \"heart-shaped\"\u00a0corrie\u00a0lake of\u00a0Lough Ouler in the Wicklow Mountains National Park. The loop walk also visits Glenmacnass Waterfall and climbs to Tonelagee\u00a0Mountain which lies just to the west of the lake. You can start the walk from the Glenmacnass Waterfall car park and then pick up a trail along the Glenmacnass River, heading north west. You then turn west along the Lough Brook which will take you to Lough Ouler. It's a a beautiful spot with the small lake surrounded by wonderful mountainous scenery. From here you can pick up trails heading south west to Tonelagee. The mountain stands at a height of 817 metres (2,680\u00a0ft), making it the third highest in the Wicklow Mountains and the 25th\u2013highest peak in\u00a0Ireland. From here there are some splendid far reaching views over the national park. To continue your walking in the area head south west to the Wicklow Gap where you can pick up trails to Turlough Hill and visit  Ireland's only\u00a0pumped-storage hydroelectricity\u00a0plant.",
