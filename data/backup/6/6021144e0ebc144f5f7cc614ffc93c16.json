You can start the walk from the Glenmacnass Waterfall car park and then pick up a trail along the Glenmacnass River, heading north west. You then turn west along the Lough Brook which will take you to Lough Ouler. It's a a beautiful spot with the small lake surrounded by wonderful mountainous scenery.

The mountain stands at a height of 817 metres (2,680 ft), making it the third highest in the Wicklow Mountains and the 25th\u2013highest peak in Ireland. From here there are some splendid far reaching views over the national park.
