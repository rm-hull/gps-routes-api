  "description": "This walk climbs to Culmstock Beacon in the Blackdown Hills AONB. You'll also visit Black Down Common where there's extensive heathland supporting a wide variety of flora and fauna. The walk starts from Millhayes, just north of Hemyock, on the River Culm. You follow quiet country lanes west and then north to Culm Davy, passing the little chapel on the way. The route then climbs past Culm Davy Hill and through the associated woodland. Bear left and you will soon come to Culmstock Beacon where you will find a stone signal station built to warn of the Spanish Armada in 1588. From the 250m (820ft) summit there are magnificent views over the surrounding countryside of Somerset and Devon. You can continue your walk across Black Down Common where you will often see horses and a variety of birdlife. The large common is a great place for walkers with lots of footpaths and more fantastic views from its elevated position. To extend your walking in the area head a couple of miles to the north east and visit the Wellington Monument. Just to the south of the beacon you will find the village of Culmstock where you can enjoy waterside footpaths through the River Culm Valley.",
