  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll along the old Andover Barge Canal on this short walk in Romsey. The Andover Canal was opened in 1794 and ran 22 miles (35 km) from Andover to Redbridge through Stockbridge and Romsey. The canal had a fall of 179 feet (55 m) through 24 locks, and for much of its length paralleled the River Anton and River Test. This walk takes you along a section of the canal in the market town of Romsey in Hampshire. You can start the walk just to the east of the train station where there's a footpath running along the narrow canal. You can follow it north for about 2 miles to Ashley Meadows before returning on the same path. Just to the west of the canal there's some nice footpaths along the River Test which also runs through the town. The town is also worth exploring with a fine Market Place with many historic buildings. There's also the splendid Romsey Abbey, the largest parish church in Hampshire. You could also pick up the waymarked Test Way which explores the beautiful Test Valley. You could follow the trail a short distance to the north and visit Mottisfont Abbey. The 13th century Augustinian priory is surrounded by glorious grounds and is a major highlight of the area. Just to the east of the town you will find the Tadburn Meadows Nature Reserve where there's a nice sculpture trail and lots of wildlife to see. The Monarch's Way long distance trail runs just to the east of the town. You can pick this up and enjoy trails through Ampfield Woods .",
