  "description": "Follow the Dog Falls Trail along the River Affric on this splendid waterside walk in the beautiful Glen Affric . The waymarked trails takes you along a series of waterfalls before climbing to a wonderful viewpoint overlooking Loch Beinn a' Mheadhain. The area consists of ancient Caledonioan Pine Forest, a dramatic rocky river gorge and a small but delightful loch. You can park at the Dog Falls car park to start your walk. From here you can pick up three waymarked trails. This route covers the Dog Falls Trail and the Viewpoint Trail. You can also head south and pick up the Coire Loch Trail which will take you to another great viewpoint overlooking a lochan surrounded by trees. You can cross the river on a bridge for even better views over the falls. See the google street view link below to see the area. To extend your walking in the glen you can head to Plodda Falls where you'll find a spectacular 46 metre high waterfall plunging into the Abhainn Deabhag river. There is also the Glen Affric walk which visits the River Affric before circuiting the beautiful Loch Affric. It's a stunning area with a series of lochs, mountains, towering pines and wildlife such as  golden eagles, mountain hares and\u00a0red deer to look out for.",
