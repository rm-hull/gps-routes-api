  "description": "The Worcestershire town of Bewdley is in a great location for exploring the popular Wyre Forest where there are miles of fine woodland trails to try. There's also lovely riverside paths along the River Severn and the nearby Ribbesford Woods. This walk uses a section of the Severn Way to take you to the Blackstone Riverside Park, just to the south of the town. The walk starts on Bewdley Bridge and follows the waymarked path south for about 1 mile on the river's eastern side. You then cross to the western side to visit the Blackstone Riverside Park where there is a picnic area and some nice trails to try. The route then returns to Bewdley on the other side of the river. To continue your walking in the area head south along the river to visit Stourport. There's nice trails to follow around Hartlebury Common and along the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal which starts in the town. If you head north along the river to Dowles you can pick up the Geopark Way and head west into the expansive Wyre Forest. There's nice trails along the Dowles Brook to Knowles Mill and Chamberline Wood. Bewdley is the start point for the Worcestershire Way and North Worcestershire Path long distance footpaths. The former runs all the way to Great Malvern in the Malvern Hills, while the latter will take you to Shirley, in the West Midlands, through four beautiful country parks.",
