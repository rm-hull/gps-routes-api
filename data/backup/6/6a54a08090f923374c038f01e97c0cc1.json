      "caption": "Port Mulgrave Harbour. The village owes its existence to the ironstone industry. The blocked up mine entrance can still be seen 50' above high water above what remains of the harbour. Gradually the Port Mulgrave mine itself was abandoned but the harbour continued to be used for Grinkle Park ore until 1917 when a connection was made to the Middlesbrough to Whitby railway owing to the wartime dangers to shipping. The machinery at the harbour was finally dismantled in 1934 during which the wooden gantry accidentally caught fire. Later the Royal Engineers destroyed the breakwater to prevent German forces using the place for an invasion."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from the pretty village of Staithes to the nearby Port Mulgrave. The route includes a coastal section before returning inland via coutryside and woodland. It's a 4 mile walk with some moderate climbs on the way. The walk starts at the picturesque Staithes Harbour where you can pick up the Cleveland Way National Trail. Follow the waymarked footpath south east along the cliff top and it will take you into Port Mulgrave. It used to be a busy port but when the mines closed, the harbour lost its commercial life. There are still a few cliff top houses overlooking a small harbour though. The route then leaves the coast and heads south west past Hinderwell on country lanes and footpaths. These will take you to Oakrigg Wood where you turn north to return to Staithes.",
