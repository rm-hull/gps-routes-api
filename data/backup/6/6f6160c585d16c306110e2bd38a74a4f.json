  "description": "Explore the extensive grounds of the 17th century Waterperry House on this short walk near Oxford.  In the grounds you will find a formal knot garden, trained fruit and nursery beds and a riverside walk along the River Thame. There are also nurseries, orchards, a plant centre and a teashop. The Oxfordshire Way walking route runs past the gardens so this is a good option if you'd like to continue your walk.",
