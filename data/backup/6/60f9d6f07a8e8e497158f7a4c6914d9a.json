  "description": "This figure of eight walk takes you on a tour of the coast, countryside, woodland and villages around Portishead in Somerset. You start in the town centre of Portishead and soon join the splendid coastal path along the Severn Estuary which takes you past Walton, Charlcombe, Ladye and Margaret's Bay. At Clevedon the route then heads inland through some delightful countryside, passing through the pretty village of Clapton in Gordano before returning to Portishead. The walk was devised by the Gordano Footpath Group and is waymarked with their symbol throughout. In Portishead you can visit Portsbury Wharf on our Portishead Nature Reserve Walk. There's lots of wildlife to see with two large pools, several ponds, grazing marsh, hay meadows and hedgerow. Just to the south of Clevedon you could try the Poets Walk which takes you along cliff tops associated with various poets who visited the area.",
