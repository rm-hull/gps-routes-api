This hill fort once had concentric ditches and earthen walls which were kept in place by wooden\u00a0palisades. Although the fort has vanished, the ditch (the Ring) dug around the edge can clearly be seen and walked along, being 5\u00a0metres deep in places and offering an adventurous route along its edge."

The river that flows through Cambridge used to be called the Granta, but it later became the Cam by back-formation from the name of the town (which is itself a corruption of Grantabridge or something similar). A mile above Grantchester it divides into two, the 'River Cam or Rhee' and the 'River Cam or Granta' (according to the OS). Into the latter flows this little trickle, also called the Granta."

  "description": "This walk explores the Gog Magog Downs, a ridge of low chalk hills extending for several miles to the southeast of Cambridge. You start your walk at the village of Stapleford\u00a0four miles to the south of\u00a0Cambridge. The village became famous when it emerged that\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0was a direct descendant of Thomas Blossom, who lived in Stapleford during the 16th century before emigrating to the United States. You can pick up footpaths taking you from the village to Ash Grove, crossing the River Granta on the way. The walk then climbs to Copley Hill and Wandlebury Country Park where there is an Iron Age Hill Fort and a nature reserve. From the 74\u00a0m (243\u00a0ft) summit of Wandlebury Hill there are great views over the surrounding Cambrideshire countryside.",
