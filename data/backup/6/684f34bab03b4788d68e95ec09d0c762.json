  "description": "This walk explores Adel Woods on the northern side of the city of Leeds. You can start the walk from the car park at the northern end of the site. From here you can follow pleasant woodland trails south along a section of the Dales Way and the Meanwood Valley Trail. There's interesting rock formations, the impressive 7 arches aqueduct and the Adel Beck to see in the woods. There's also lots of wildlife with deer, kingfishers, woodpeckers and red kite to look out for. The woods are also good for mountain biking with some good trails and jumps to try. You can easily extend the walk by heading north along the Dales Way to visit Eccup Reservoir. The large lake is only just over a mile from the car park and includes a nice waterside trail.",
