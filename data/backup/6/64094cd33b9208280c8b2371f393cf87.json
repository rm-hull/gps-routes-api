The Grade II listed structure stands at a height of 84 feet (26 m) and is something of a local landmark. It was commissioned as a family memorial and completed in 1758 at the same time as Hagley Park was being redeveloped in the fashionable neoclassical style. Just to the south east there's more fine trails around Waseley Hills Country Park. The park is also home to the source of the River Rea which runs through the area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Worcestershire Walks page."
