These porticoed Classical towers are all that survive from the church of St Mary the Virgin, originally built in 1735 and re-modelled in an unconventional style by Robert Adam in 1776. The nave between the two towers was demolished in 1870 when a new church was built nearby. The Towers come under the overall supervision of English Heritage, but are managed by the local Residents' Association, from whom a key is available."

  "description": "The Essex town of Manningtree is nicely located on the estuary of the River Stour in the Tendring district of the county. There's some lovely riverside paths and country walking opportunities along the long distance Essex Way which passes through the town. This circular walk in the town takes you along the River Stour before heading inland through the countryside and woodland to the south of the town. The route runs for just over 3 miles, using a mixture public footpaths and waymarked trails. The walk starts from Mistley train station where you can pick up the Essex Way and follow it west along the river. There's lovely views across the water to Seafield Bay and Cattawade on the other side. It's a very pleasant path with lots of yachts to see and a number of benches where you can stop to rest. You'll also pass the noteworthy Mistley Towers. These twin towers stood at each end of a now demolished Georgian church, and were designed by Robert Adam in 1776. The route then leaves the river, turning south through the town. Head east and you will pass Dairy Wood, Laundry Wood and Furze Hill. At Mistley Heath you turn north west to return to the train station.",
