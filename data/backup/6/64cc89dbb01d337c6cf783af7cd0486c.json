  "description": "This walk takes you along the River Corrib walkway in the city centre, a harbour city on Ireland\u2019s west coast. The city is a lovely place for a walk with stone-clad cafes, boutiques, art galleries and interesting shops around the attractive 18th-century Eyre Square. You can start off on the eastern side of the river from O'Briens Bridge on Bridge Street. The route then follows the easy surfaced footpath north to Salmon Weir Bridge. On the way there are lovely views over river to the city with its colorful houses and historic buildings such as the cathedral. There's photgenic bridges, weirs and wildlife such as grey heron to see on the way. Also look out for the local fishermen and the attractive riverside fencing and hedges with in wisteria and morning glory. The walk finishes on Salmon Weir Bridge where you can see the wild salmon leaping between May and September. Head north from the city and you could enjoy more waterside walking at Lough Corrib. The river enters the lough at the southern end of what is the largest lake within the Republic of Ireland.",
