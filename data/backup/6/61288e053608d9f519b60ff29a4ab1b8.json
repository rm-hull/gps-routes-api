  "description": "Enjoy a stroll along the Lancaster Canal from Carnforth to Bolton-le-Sands on this easy. Along the way there's nice views towards Morecambe Bay and the mountains of the Lake District. The walk starts just to the east of the town centre and train station. You can pick up the canal towpath on Kellet Road and follow it south west to Bolton-le-Sands. The large village has an old church with a tower dating from 1500. There's also a number of nice pubs where you can stop for refreshment at what is the halfway point of the walk. After exploring the village the walk follows a mixture of country lanes and public footpaths back to Carnforth. This section takes you through the countryside around Mount Pleasant, where you can enjoy great views to the coast from the elevated position. The Lancashire Coastal Way passes through the town and is a great way of continuing your walking in the area. You could follow the long distance path north and visit Warton Crag in the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. The nature reserve has another great viewpoint and also includes lots of interesting flora and fauna. Leighton Moss Nature Reserve can be found in this area too. Heading south along the trail will take you along Morecambe Bay to the town of Morecambe. The Lunesdale Walk also starts in Carnforth. The long distance trail explores the woodland, countryside and hills surrounding the town.",
