  "description": "These woods in Bedlington have nice trails to follow along the River Blyth. It's a peaceful place for a stroll with the stepping stones and the woodland wildlife the main highlights. You can park at the car park at Humford Mill and follow trails south along both sides of the river. The trails will eventually lead you to Plessey Woods Country Park just north of Cramlington . Here you'll find 100 acres of woodland and meadow with miles of cycling and walking trails. The woods are also next to Bedlington Country Park where you can extend your walk in the other direction. The park includes some nice trails along the River Blyth estuary into the coastal town of Blyth .",
