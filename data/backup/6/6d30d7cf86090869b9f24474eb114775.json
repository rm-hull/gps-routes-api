  "description": "This coastal country park is located in Folkestone and has fabulous views over the Kent coastline. National Cycle Route 2 also runs through the park. The park is  divided into three zones. These include a formal zone with lovely gardens and pine avenues. The fun zone includes a free adventure play area and an amphitheatre. Finally, there's the wild zone with lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for. It's a delightful place with imposing cliffs, interesting rock formations, wildflower meadows and lots in intersting plants and flowers. You can extend your walking in the area by try our Dover to Folkestone Walk. It will take you east to the Folkestone Roman Villa and the nearby East Cliff and Warren Country Park. There's great views to be had from the elevated position of the park.",
