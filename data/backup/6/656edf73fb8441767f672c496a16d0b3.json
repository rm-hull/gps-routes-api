  "description": "This walk takes you through the lovely Glen Arklet in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. On the way you will enjoy great views of Loch Arklet and pass the pretty Inversnaid Falls on Arklet Water. The route starts at the Inversnaid Hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond, before a short stroll takes you to the lovely Inversnaid falls on Arklet Water. You continue by climbing through the surrounding woodland along Arklet Water to Loch Arklet. There are splendid views back towards Loch Lomond. The path continues above Loch Arklet through Glen Arklet,  before finishing at the pier on Loch Katrine . You could extend your walk by continuing along the super lochside path at Loch Katrine or head back to Inversnaid on the same path.",
