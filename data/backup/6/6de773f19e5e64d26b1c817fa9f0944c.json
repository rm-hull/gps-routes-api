  "description": "This walk explores the delightful Dean Village in the city of Edinburgh. The historic area is a popular place for a walk with old mills, picturesque dwellings and a walkway along the Water of Leith taking you to Thomas Telford's impressive Dean Bridge. You'll also pass the Dean Gallery, housed in the impressive 18th century former orphanage building. The gallery houses the Paolozzi Gift, a collection of works by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi, given by the artist to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 1994. There's also a sculpture garden with a series of modern and avant-garde works. There's more historic architecture to see at Well Court. The photogenic structure was built in the 1880s and housed local workers who worked at the village's water mills. You can extend the walk on the Water of Leith route which runs for just over 12 miles from Balerno to Leith along the small river. The popular trail runs along a flat path which is also suitable for cyclists.",

You can also enjoy an easier waterside walk around the scenic Duddingston Loch in this area. For another fine hill climb you could head south to Blackford Hill where you can also visit the delightful woodland at Hermitage Of Braid."
