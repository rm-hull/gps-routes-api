  "description": "Explore the 460 acres of gorgeous Wealden countryside in the Sissinghurst Castle Estate on this walk in Kent. You can stroll through the stunning gardens before heading into the surrounding woodland to stretch your legs further. Highlights include the gazebo by the pretty moat, and the 16th century tower with\u00a0vast panoramic views from the top. There's also some nice woodland with pretty bluebells in the spring. The gardens are varied and extensive with a rose garden, herb garden, orchard and glasshouses. There are also a number of ruined buildings and a library with a collection of 11000 rare books. Sissinghurt Castle is located near Cranbrook and Tenterden in Kent.",
