  "description": "This circular cycle or walk explores the area surrounding the Yorkshire town of Settle. It's a beautiful area with striking limestone scenery and some challenging climbs with the reward of magnificent far reaching views. The circuit runs for about 10 miles with views of Malham Tarn , Yorkshire's Three Peaks and Attermire Scar. At the eastern end of the route you have the option of continuing on to the splendid Malham Tarn Estate . Here you can enjoy cycling and walking trails around the beautiful glacial lake and enjoy a climb to Fountains Fell . Just off the route near Settle is the wonderful Scaleber Force . It's located off High Hill Lane near the end of the route and is well worth the short detour. Also nearby is Catrigg Force and Stainforth Force. These are just to the north of Settle and are real highlights of the area. The route makes up part of the Pennine Bridleway so mountain bikers can enjoy the route as well. To extend your walking in the Settle area you could try the Settle to Malham Cove Walk which will take you to the spectacular limestone cliff formation at Malham Cove .",
