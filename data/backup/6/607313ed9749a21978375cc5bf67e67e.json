  "description": "This large forest near St Albans has some fine cycling and walking trails to try. The forest includes over half a million trees, ancient woodland, wildflower meadows and miles of waymarked walks. There's also bridleways suitable for mountain biking. It's great in the spring with carpets of bluebells and lots of wildlife to look out for. This includes barn owls, tawny owls, kestrels and 27 species of butterfly. There is also a community orchard with apple and pears trees plus an arboretum which, once fully grown, will be the only one known in the UK to contain all 57 of our native tree species. There's three waymarked walks to try all of which are fairly easy and of similar lengths. These take place on a mixture of surfaced tracks and grassy paths. You can park at the car park near the village of Sandridge to start your walk. The bridleways can also be picked up from the High Street in the village. The area includes Langley Wood and Pudler's Wood with Nomansland Common just to the north. If you are on a bike please keep to the marked bridleways. The forest is located near to a number of excellent cycling and walking trails. If you head north towards Wheathampstead you can pick up the Ayot Greenway. This rail trail will take you to Welwyn Garden City on a marked National Cycle Route. You can also pick up the Lea Valley Walk and enjoy a riverside stroll. See the St Albans Cycle Routes page for more rides around the area.",
