  "description": "This walk from the town heads through the countryside to visit the historic town of Ironbridge on the River Severn. On the way there's an easy climb to a pleasant viewpoint located just to the south of the town. The walk starts from train station and follows roads south through the town. You then pick up footpaths to climb to Lodge Hill. It's a small hill but there are still some nice views over the town and the surrounding countryside to the nearby Wrekin hill. You then descend Lodge Hill to pick up the Monarch's Way . Follow the waymarked trail south west and it will take you to Kemberton before coming to the river at Coalport. Here you'll pass the pretty Coalport Canal and the interesting\u00a0Coalport China Museum\u00a0which is well worth visiting if you have time. At Coalport you can pick up a section of the Severn Way and follow it west along the river to Ironbridge. The town takes its name from,\u00a0The Iron Bridge, a 100-foot (30\u00a0m)\u00a0cast iron\u00a0bridge that opened in 1781. It includes The\u00a0Ironbridge Gorge, formed by a glacial overflow from the long drained away\u00a0Lake Lapworth, at the end of the\u00a0last ice age.",
