  "description": "This walk visits this interesting gritstone crag which is popular with rock climbers. There are fascinating geological rock formations and wonderful views over the Peak District to enjoy. The walk starts from Whaley Bridge, near the train train station in the town. You then follow footpaths around the pretty Toddbrook Reservoir before climbing to Taxal Moor. From here you can enjoy super views back towards Whaley Bridge and the reservoir. The final section takes you along Taxal Edge to the rocks where you can enjoy splendid views over the surrounding countryside. The walk can be extended by continuing south to Shining Tor and Cats Tor. It's a great ridge walk with more wide ranging views. Also nearby are Errwood Reservoir and Fernilee Reservoirs where you can enjoy waterside trails.",
