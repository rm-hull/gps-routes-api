      "content": "The Embsay and Bolton Abbey Railway is a great way to see the lovely scenery surrounding Bolton Abbey. You can pick up the heritage railway just to the south of the abbey at Bolton Abbey Station. Here you can enjoy a ride on a vintage steam locomotive to Embsay where you can visit Embsay Reservoir. The rolling stock on the line consists of 20 ex-industrial locomotives, the oldest of which was built in 1908, three diesel-multiple units, and ten other diesel locomotives. Embsay station dates back to 1888 and has good facilities with a cafe, gift shop, bookshop and picnic tables. It's a nice place to stroll around and watch the trains come in and go out.  Pictured above left Embsay railway station looking towards Bolton Abbey station. On the right part of the track between Embsay and Bolton Abbey with a siding to the left. This section was restored in the 1990s over 100 years after its initial opening as part of the line from Ilkley to Skipton. Other route highlights include the splendid Ilkley Moor and the famous Cow and Calf rocks. The delightful village of Burley in Wharfedale is also near the route in this area. The route links with the long distance Lady Anne's Way in various places. It runs through the Yorkshire Dales to Penrith, passing several historic buildings associated with Lady Anne Clifford. The noteworthy Noblewoman was a signficant restorer of many English castles during the 17th century."
