  "description": "This walk takes you from London Bridge to Tower Bridge in the City of London. It's just over half a mile between the two iconic bridges so the walk should take around 10-15 minutes. This circular route crosses both bridges, passing along both sides of the River Thames on the Thames Path National Trail. It extends the walk to a distance of 1.5 miles and includes two bridge crossings where you can enjoy fine views down the river to some iconic London highlights. On the way you will pass the famous Tower of London where you can see the Crown Jewels of England and the notorious prison. There are also great views of London's more modern buildings including the Gherkin, City Hall and the Shard. You can extend your walk by heading west to visit some of London's beautiful parks including St James's Park, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. The long distance Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk is a popular way of exploring this area on foot. You could also head east on the Tower Bridge to Greenwich Walk which will take you to Greenwich Park where you will find the Royal Observatory, the home of Greenwich Mean Time, the Prime Meridian and London's only Planetarium.",
