    "description": "This circular walk from Halesowen visits the historic Halesowen Abbey before a stroll along the old Halesowen Railway path. The walk starts from the car park in Leasowes Park. The park is one of the area highlights with good footpaths taking you woodland, streams and ponds with lots of wildlife to see on the way. From the car park you can pick up a section of the long distance Monarch's Way and follow the waymarked footpath south to Halesowen Abbey. The ancient site dates back to the 13th century when it was founded by King John. You can follow footpaths past the photogenic abbey ruins to link up with the Illey Way around Illey farm. This footpath runs along the old railway line and can be followed south to visit the remains of the once significant Dowery Dell Viaduct which was dismantled in 1965. Near here there's also the remains of the Elan Aqueduct, another notable feature of the railway which opened in 1878. It closed to passengers in 1919 and then completely closed in 1964. After viewing the Elan Aqueduct the route then heads north along the dismantled railway towards the abbey. From here you can retrace your footsteps to Leasowes Park. You can extend the walk by continuing south along the railway path to visit Waseley Hills Country Park .",
