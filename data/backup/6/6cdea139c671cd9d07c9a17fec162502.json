  "description": "This walk takes you on a tour of the National Trust owned Ashridge Estate in the Chiltern Hills. The estate consists of 5,000 acres of woodlands, commons and chalk downland which supports a rich variety of wildlife. The walk starts at the Ashridge Estate Visitor Centre next to the Bridgewater Monument, erected in 1832 to the Duke of Bridgewater. You can climb the monument for fabulous panoramic views of the estate before starting the circular tour of the beautiful grounds. Highlights on the walk include the Golden Valley to the north-east of Little Gaddesden and Ashridge House which was created by famous landscape gardener Capability Brown in the 18th century. You will also visit Ivinghoe Beacon , with its splendid views of the Vale of Aylesbury, Berkhamsted Common and Dunstable Downs . Another highlight of the walk is the popular Dockey Wood . The little wood is located towards the north eastern section of the estate and is covered in pretty bluebells in the spring months. Our Chilterns Pub Walk starts from the nearby Greyhound Inn in Aldbury. It visits Aldbury common before climbing up to Ivinghoe Beacon and returning to the popular pub for refreshments.",
