There is another Bruce\u0092s Stone at Glen Trool that commemorates the Battle of Trool also in 1307. Here you can visit the splendid Loch Trool. Here you can enjoy a popular circular walk around the loch where you'll pass the stone. This is where Robert the Bruce with a few infantry let 1500 English soldiers with cavalry chase him up this south side of Glen Trool. At this point he had laid an ambush, the rest of his men rolled stones down this hillside to pitch men and horses into the loch, and followed up by attack with archers, so defeating the English."

  "description": "This large freshwater reservoir is part of the wider Galloway Forest Park in Dumfries and Galloway. At the eastern side of the loch you'll find good facilities with a visitor centre, cafe and car parking area. Here you can pick up some nice walking trails taking you along the water to the memorial stone and Bruce's Stone. The historical landmark is said to be the spot where Robert the Bruce once rested after battle. There's also lovely views over the water to the surrounding hills and some peaceful woodland trails to enjoy at the site. Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of wildlife including deer and Red Kites.",
