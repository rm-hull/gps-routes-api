  "description": "Explore this large area of forest near Charlbury on this woodland walk. The forest can be reached from the nearby village of Finstock or from Charlbury. There are rail stations at both. The forest consists of hundreds of acres of attractive woodland, pretty streams and a series of lakes and ponds. The area is also a nature reserve so look out for a variety of interesting flora and fauna. These include several species of wildflower such as celadine, kidney vetch and bluebells. These flowers attract butterflies such as Barberry Carpet and Pale Shining Brown. Wychwood fair is a popular event which takes place in the forest at Cornbury Park . The\u00a0fairs are centred on rural communities and crafts. The Oxfordshire Way passes through the area so you could pick up this long distance path to extend your walk. If you head east along the path you will come to Woodstock and the beautiful Blenheim Park . If you head north west from Charlbury you can enjoy a walk along the River Evenlode to Ascott-under-Wychwood.",
