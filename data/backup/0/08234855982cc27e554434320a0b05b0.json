It is a high exposed point (603m) at SX 617862 which is visible from many other parts of the moor. There is no tor - just an army observation station - but the views on a mist free day are superb. The name Hangingstone derives from a logan rock (or rocking stone) that is on the NW slope of the hill. Alas the rock no longer rocks."

  "description": "A wonderful circular walk around the fascinating Dartmoor National Park with plenty of lovely riverside walking and some challenging climbs. The walk starts near the car park at Bellever and first follows the East Dart River through Postbridge and on to Sittaford Tor where you will pass the historical Grey Wethers Stone Circle. Challenging climbs on Whitehorse Hill and Hangingstone Hill follow, offering fabulous views of Dartmoor and the surrounding areas. The walk continues past Oke Tor to the town of Okehampton where you will pass the ruins of the 11th century Okehampton Castle. You then join the East Okemont River and the River Taw for two pleasant waterside stretches which lead you to the little village of Sticklepath. From here you head south towards Teigncombe where you join the River Teign for another riverside section which passes Chagford and the Wooton Castle Iron Age Hill fort before reaching the delightful Meadhaydown Wood Nature Reserve. The route then turns west towards Moretonhampstead (notable for having the longest one-word name of any place in England), the fine Bovey Castle hotel and then the fascinating Grimspound Bronze Age settlement which consists of a set of 24 hut circles surrounded by a low stone wall. The final section takes you past the wooded Soussons Down to the finish point back at Bellever.",
