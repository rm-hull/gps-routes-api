      "caption": "Old river bank defences. It appears from this photo that the bank of the River Orwell has retreated over the years. The line of posts was probably intended to anchor the bank, but there is now some 15 metres of stone and shingle between these posts and the present river bank. The colouration of the soil indicates the normal tidal range; at high water springs the tide rises past these posts. It is when the high tides are coupled with stormy weather that the banks are eroded. This side of the river is very exposed to prevailing westerly winds."

  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside stroll along Nacton Shores on this easy walk in Suffolk. You can park at the car park on Shore Lane, near Orwell School to start your walk. From here you can pick up footpaths along the River Orwell with its nice beach and views across the river. You can follow the path all the way to the Levington Lagoon Nature Reserve at the eastern end of the shore. To extend your walk you can continue along the riverside path to Trimley Marshes Nature Reserve. Here you'll find a splendid circular trail taking you to lakes and lagoons with a huge variety of water loving wildlife to look out for. The path will eventually take you into Felixstowe . You could also pick up the Suffolk Coast Path and head north west towards Nacton village before coming to Orwell Country Park . This large riverside park on the outskirts of Ipswich has some nice woodland walking trails to try.",
