  "description": "This popular walk climbs to Raven Crag above Thirlmere Reservoir in the Lake District. The walk starts from the Dam triangle car park at the northern end of Thirlmere. From here head north and then west to pick up the waymarked footpath to the summit. You will climb along a steep path through woodland before turning south to the 461 metre high summit of Raven Crag. From here you can enjoy wonderful views down to the lake and across to the surrounding Lakeland Fells. To continue your walking around Thirlmere you could head to the other side of the lake and try the popular climb to Helvellyn . Just to the south of the crag there's an easy climb to Harrop Tarn along the Dob Gill. There's a car park here and a pretty waterfall to see before you reach the picturesque little tarn.",
