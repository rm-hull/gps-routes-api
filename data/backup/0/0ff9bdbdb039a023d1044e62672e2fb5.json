Although it is shown in a Gothic font on the Ordnance Survey 1:10,000 mapping, with the suffix (Res) implying that it has been restored, there is not a great amount of information currently available about it. In 1666 it was described as being \"in decay\", so presumably the restoration took place after that date. A couple of antiquarian writers describe the water level, which is just visible at the bottom of the photograph, as being \"60 feet below the bridge\"."

  "description": "Lydford Gorge is a splendid place to visit for a short circular walk through dramatic surroundings. It is located in the Dartmoor National Park near the town of Lydford and is notable as the deepest gorge in the South West of England. The footpaths take you through the wooded glade to the fantastic 100-foot-high (30-metre) 'White Lady Waterfall'. In wet weather the falls are a spectacular sight being the highest waterfall in the south west. You will also visit a series of noisy whirlpools known as the 'Devil's Cauldron' where the water seems to be boiling. Another highlight are the Tunnel Falls - a series of potholes formed by the River Lyd eroding the rock away. Start the walk from the National Trust car park next to the Devil's Cauldron. You can then follow the woodland trails south along the river before crossing to the other side and turning it into a circular walk by following the western paths. The route runs for just under 2 miles on an undulating path. Look out for flora including pretty wood anenome and bluebells which cover the steep slopes of the gorge during the spring months. The gorge is located next to the Dartmoor Way long distance walk so you could continue your walk by following the path south towards Mary Tavy and Tavistock or north towards Bridestowe and Okehampton . Also nearby is the splendid Tavy Cleave and Hare Tor where you can enjoy the steep-sided valley of the River Tavy before climbing Hare Tor for wonderful views over Dartmoor.",
