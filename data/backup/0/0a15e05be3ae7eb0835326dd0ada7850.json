  "description": "This circular walk visits the historic Shap Abbey and the village of Shap in Cumbria. You'll explore the pretty Abbey Park with views of the River Lowther before heading into the village. The walk starts at the car park at Abbey Bridge about half a mile west of Shap village. From here you can pick up public footpaths heading past the atmospheric ruins of the 13th century abbey. The area is very photogenic with the abbey, river and the surrounding countryside making a splendid backdrop. Nearly all of the abbey buildings have been demolished, however the tower remains are still impressive, and the outline of the building plan is clearly visible. The paths lead south east to the small 16th-century Keld Chapel, now in the care of the National Trust. From the chapel you can then follow Keld Lane north east into Shap. The village has good facilities with three pubs where you can stop for refreshments. After exploring the village the route follows country lanes west, past Skellaw Hill, before returning to the car park. Shap is on the epic Wainwright's Coast to Coast walk so there is good scope for continuing your walking in the area. If you were to head west you could visit Haweswater where there are some lovely trails along the water.",
