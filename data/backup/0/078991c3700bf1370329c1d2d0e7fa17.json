  "description": "This walk from the Northamptonshire town of Thrapston takes you along the River Nene to the neighbouring village of Wadenhoe. On the way you'll enjoy riverside trails and a visit to the lovely Titchmarsh Nature Reserve. The walk starts in Thrapston next to the viaduct where you can pick up the Nene Way and follow the waymarked trail north west to Islip. The trail then runs between the lakes in the nature reserve before coming to Aldwincle and Wadenhoe. The delightful village includes thatched cottages, an old mill and a mill pond which are all very picturesque. After exploring the village you turn south to return to Aldwincle before following alternative public footpaths through the reserve. These will lead you back into Thrapston where the route finishes.",

Here you'll find 750 acres of parkland and nature reserve with fine views of the Nene Valley. There is also a linear path linking the reserve with Thrapston which runs along a disused railway line. Near the lakes there's also Irchester Country Park where there's some nice woodland trails. An abundance of wildlife can also be found at Summer Leys Nature Reserve near the park. Also to the south there's the Ringstead Circular Walk which explores the pretty Kinewell Lake and the neighbouring villages of Woodford and Denford."
