The reservoirs attract a large variety of water birds with the Great Crested Grebe a regular visitor. Also look out for Tree Creeper, Long-Tailed Tit, Woodpeckers, Tawny owls  and Red Squirrels in the woodland area. The park has an excellent Ranger Centre where you can hire sailboards, sailing dinghies and kayaks from May to September. There is also a nice cafe with picnic tables.
