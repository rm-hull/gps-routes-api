A canal basin was constructed here in the 18th century with strong harbour walls and iron mooring rings [visible in photo] as part of a grand scheme to link Bedale with the Rivers Swale, Ure and Ouse. The project ran out of money and was never completed, but Bedale was left with its 'harbour' and a straightened section of Bedale Beck. See also photos of other sites associated with this scheme at SE3976 and SE4382."

The oldest part of the building is the 5 bay ashlar front [seen here] which dates from the 1730s, and was built for the Pierce family. The rendered wings to the left and right are later. During WW2 it was requisitioned for use by the armed forces and fell into disrepair once squatters moved in in 1948. The local district council purchased it in 1951 and began restoration work. It now belongs to Hambleton District Council and is used for functions, a library and a museum."
