  "description": "Climb this popular fell near Keswick on this lovely circular walk in the Lake District National Park. The walk starts in the town of Keswick and ascends Latrigg using the Cumbria Way and other footpaths. You continue towards Brundholme before returning through Brundholme Wood with a section along the Keswick Railway Path leading back into Keswick. This final section includes waterside walking along the River Greta. The summit stands at 368 m (1,207 ft) and the views of Derwent Water, Keswick and down the valley of Borrowdale are stunning. This is a popular walk because of its proximity to Keswick. It is also a relatively straightforward climb on well defined paths. Another popular fell is the nearby Catbells which gives faboulous views across Derwent Water. Also nearby is the fascinating Castlerigg Stone Circle. The ancient stone circle is located about a mile from Kewswick and is well worth a visit.",
