  "description": "This circular walk from Moreton-in-Marsh makes use of the Monarch's Way and the Heart of England Way to explore the countryside, villages and woodland surrounding the popular Cotswolds town. Moreton-in-Marsh is a good base for exploring the Cotswolds with a train station and lots of good hotels to choose from. It's also very close to two major Cotswolds attractions. This includes the magnificent Sezincote House and Batsford Arboretum which are both on this route. Starting in the town you follow the Monarch's Way south to the village of Longborough where you will find a 12th century church and an opera house home to the Longborough Festival Opera in June and July each year. At Longborough you turn north along the Heart of England Way towards the exquisite Sezincote House. Here you will find a fascinating Mogul Indian palace surrounded by beautiful gardens including an orangery, spring-fed pools, canals and a large lake. After passing Sezincote you continue north to the pretty village of Bourton-on-the-Hill where you will find the Grade I listed St. Lawrence's Church, the 17th century Slatters Cottage and the fine Horse and Groom pub. After leaving the village you head towards Batsford Arboretum where there are 56 acres of woodland consisting of Japanese maples, magnolias and pines. The final section heads east through farmland back to Moreton-in-Marsh.",
