In 1897 this Celtic cross was erected to Tennyson's memory. The inscription on the far side reads: \"IN MEMORY OF ALFRED LORD TENNYSON THIS CROSS IS RAISED A BEACON TO SAILORS BY THE PEOPLE OF FRESHWATER & OTHER FRIENDS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA\" It is situated on the highest point of the downs, nearly 150 metres above sea level."

  "description": "This walk runs from Newport to Alum Bay via Brighstone, Freshwater and Tennyson Down. The walk starts at Carisbrooke, near the fascinating Carisbrooke Castle where Charles I was imprisoned. You can enjoy the new Princess Beatrice Garden and the tranquil chapel at this fine historical attraction. Use google street view below to explore the castle. You then head through the beautiful Brighstone Down and Brighstone Forest before arriving at the coast where there are splendid views over Freshwater towards Alum Bay and The Needles. The final section takes you through the coastal Freshwater Bay Golf course and then through Tennyson Down before finishing at the delightful Alum Bay. This is quite a challenging walk with several climbs through the downs, but there are terrific views of the island to enjoy throughout. To further explore this part of the island you can pick up the Hamstead Trail, Isle of Wight Coast Path or the Freshwater Trail from Yarmouth to Freshwater Bay .",
