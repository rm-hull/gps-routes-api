  "description": "This walk runs from Newport to Alum Bay via Brighstone, Freshwater and Tennyson Down. The walk starts at Carisbrooke, near the fascinating Carisbrooke Castle where Charles I was imprisoned. You can enjoy the new Princess Beatrice Garden and the tranquil chapel at this fine historical attraction. Use google street view below to explore the castle. You then head through the beautiful Brighstone Down and Brighstone Forest before arriving at the coast where there are splendid views over Freshwater towards Alum Bay and The Needles. The final section takes you through the coastal Freshwater Bay Golf course and then through Tennyson Down before finishing at the delightful Alum Bay. This is quite a challenging walk with several climbs through the downs, but there are terrific views of the island to enjoy throughout. To further explore this part of the island you can pick up the Hamstead Trail, Isle of Wight Coast Path or the Freshwater Trail from Yarmouth to Freshwater Bay .",

      "content": "Freshwater Bay is notable as the former home of Poet Laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson, after which the trail is named. He was the Poet Laureate during much of Queen Victoria's reign and wrote the famous poem \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\". The trail is also mostly suitable for cyclists though it is mainly an off road track so a mountain bike or hybrid would be required. In Newport you can extend your walking in the expansive Parkhurst Forest. The forest is criss crossed with miles of good walking and cycling trails. It's also great for wildlife spotting with the resident red squirrels of particular note. You'll also pass through Brighstone Forest on the southern side of the island. There's a good viepoint here on Brighstone Down and on the nearby Limerstone Down which includes a handy toposcope. Brighstone is the largest area of woodland on the island with Parkhurst the second largest. Near here there's also the National Trust's Mottistone Manor to visit. Here you'll find beautiful gardens and bluebell woods in the grounds surrounding this historic Elizabethan manor house. The Red Squirrel Trail also passes through Newport. This long distance cycle route explores some of the most attractive countryside and coast on the island. For more walking ideas in the area see the Isle of Wight Walks page."
