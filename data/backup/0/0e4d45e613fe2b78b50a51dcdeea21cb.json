  "description": "Crinkle Crags stands at a height of 859\u00a0m (2,818\u00a0ft) surrounding the valleys of\u00a0Great Langdale\u00a0and Upper Eskdale . Alfred Wainwright described it thus: 'Much too good to be missed ... this is a climb deserving of high priority'. The fell gets its name from the distinctive series of five rises and depressions (crinkles) at the summit ridge. The circular walk starts at the car park near the Old Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in Great Langdale and heads to Stool End Farm on country lanes. You ascend towards Bowfell passing The Band, White Stones and Earing Crag. You then turn south passing the Three Tarns before you reach Crinkle Crags summit at 859\u00a0m (2,818\u00a0ft). There are fabulous views of Great Langdale, Eskdale, Dunnerdale, and the estuaries of the rivers Duddon and\u00a0Esk\u00a0as they enter the\u00a0Irish Sea. There is also a very good view of\u00a0Scafell Pike, which is the parent peak of Crinkle Crags. You then descend towards Great Knott and Oxendale with views of Oxendale Beck. Shortly after you rejoin the path to the car park and the finish point. To continue your walking in the area you could enjoy a climb along the lovely Dungeon Ghyll waterfall to Stickle Tarn . Also nearby are the popular Langdale Pikes .",
