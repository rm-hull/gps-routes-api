  "description": "Explore Ilam Park before heading into the beautiful Manifold Valley on this circular walk in the Staffordshire Peak District. The route runs for just over 8 miles and includes some moderately challenging hill climbs, so a reasonable level of fitness is required. The walk starts in the parking area of the National Trust owned Ilam Park. The park is a great base for exploring the White Peak area of the national park and includes lovely gardens and the Grade II* listed   Ilam Hall. You can follow footpaths west across the park before crossing the River Manifold and climbing past Musden Low hill where there are great views over the area. The route continues west past the village of Calton before coming to the River Hamps where you pick up the Manifold Way long distance trail. At Beeston Tor you have the option of continuing north along the River Manifold but this route turns south east past Old Park Hill. You'll pass the ruins of Throwley Old Hall before following country lanes to Rushley and then back to Ilam Park. If you enjoy this walk then you could head east from the park and try our Dovedale Circular Walk. The route visits the beautiful valley of the River Dove with its fascinating limestone rock formations, interesting plant life and cave system. You can also pick up the long distance Limestone Way and explore the Peak District's finest limestone scenery.",
