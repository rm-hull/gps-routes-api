  "description": "Bere Island is located in Bantry Bay off the Beara Peninsula in County Cork. It's a great place for walking with miles of trails and some stunning scenery to enjoy. You can catch the ferry from Castletownbere to reach the island. This walk around the island follows sections of the Beara Way, the Ardnakinna West Island Loop and the Rerrin Loop. These waymarked footpaths can be combined to create a fantastic long circular walk around the island. To continue your island walking in the area you could head to the nearby Dursey Island and pick up the Dursey Island Loop .",
