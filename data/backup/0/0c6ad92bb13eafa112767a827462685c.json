  "description": "This literary circular walk in Hampshire climbs to Shoulder of Mutton Hill to visit the memorial of the poet Edward Thomas in the Hampshire Downs. The circular route runs for just over 3 miles with a moderate climb on the way. There's lovely views over the Hampshire Downs to enjoy on the way. The walk starts from the village of Hawkley and heads south along the Hangers Way waymarked trail. You'll pass Oakshott before climbing to Shoulder of Mutton Hill. Here you'll find a sarsen stone dedicated to Edward Thomas erected in 1935. The inscription includes the final line from one of his essays: 'And I rose up and knew I was tired and I continued my journey.' The steep Hampshire Hangars inspired many of his poems including Up in the Wind, The New House and Wind and Mist. There's also splendid views across the South Downs from here. The route then descends past Wheatham Hill and Cheescombe Farm before returning to Hawkley. Here you can enjoy refreshments at the Hawkley Inn. To extend your walking in the area you can follow the Hangar's Way north to Selborne Common and Noar Hill .",
