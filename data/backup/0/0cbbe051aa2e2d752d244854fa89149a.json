It is reputed to be over 1,000 years old. in the first half of the 20th Century visitors could walk right up to the tree but now it is fenced off to protect the soil around the trunk from erosion and the tree itself.\nIn the mid 18th Century the tree was known as the Cock Pen Tree as it was used as a holding site for fighting cocks which were stacked in wicker baskets and hessian sacks inside the hollow trunk before they were released for the now illegal sport of cock fighting.\nIn 1790 a Major Hayman Rooke wrote a popular book called \"Remarkable Oaks in the Park of Welbeck in the County of Nottinghamshire\" in which he mentioned the tree. A short time later the tree was renamed the Major's Oak which was quickly modified to the Major Oak. Apart from a short period in the 19th Century when it acquired the additional name of the Queen Oak, it retains this name to this day."

      "caption": "Gleadthorpe Open in the Sherwood Forest Country Park. The lack of flowering plants and trees on Gleadthorpe Open is due to a number of factors. The old common rights custom of 'pannage', bringing livestock into the forest to graze, meant that pigs grubbed out the root stock whilst foraging; fire was the probable cause of the tree loss and as it is low lying Gleadthorpe Open is susceptible to late frosts. Queen Oak Plantation is straight ahead. This probably originates from the 19th Century when a common name for the Major Oak was The Queen Oak."

The village includes an attractive High Street and a noteworthy medieval church with connections to the legend of Robin Hood. This long circular walk from the village uses a section of the Robin Hood Way to visit Sherwood Forest Country Park , Clumber Country Park and the neighbouring town of Ollerton. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the Robin Hood Way and follow the waymarked footpath north into Sherwood Forest Country Park. This area of woodland includes a visitor centre, lots of wildlife and woodland trails suitable for cycling and walking. You'll also pass the Major Oak, an ancient tree thought to be over 1000 years old. Follow the trail north and it will take you over the River Meden to the Gleadthorpe Breck Plantation. Here you head east to the Budby Corner Plantation before turning north to enter the splendid Clumber Park. You can follow the trails east to take you along the lovely lake to Hardwick Village.
