  "description": "This walk explores Ashes Hollow near the villages of Church Stretton and Little Stretton in the Shropshire Hills. The V shaped valley is home to the Quinny Brook, a tributary stream of the River Onny. It's a lovely place for a walk with waterside footpaths along the pretty brook which is flanked by some beautiful hills and attractive vegetation. You can start the walk in Little Stretton and head north to pick up the trail along the brook. The stream continues up to the Long Mynd where you can enjoy some wonderful views from the elevated ridge.",
