The park was originally established by the Harcourt family after the Norman conquest and later came into the hands of the Dixie family in 1567. The Dixie family significantly influenced the development of the estate, which was known as \u2018Southwood\u2019 at the time. In 1665, they were granted the right to enclose 400 acres of the land to create a park for stags and other wildlife, encompassing what is now the present-day country park.\nDuring the late 18th century, the park was landscaped in the style of Capability Brown, one of England's most famous landscape architects. This involved the planting of small woods and individual trees, enhancing the natural beauty of the area. Notably, the park was home to England\u2019s only herd of pure black fallow deer, making it unique in its ecological significance."

In the early 1970s, the park was purchased by the county council, which has since undertaken conservation efforts to preserve and enhance the historic landscape. In recent years, these efforts have included the planting of 60 new specimen trees to commemorate the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee. This replanting includes Elm trees that are resistant to Dutch Elm disease, a species that was once widespread across the English countryside before the disease devastated populations in the 20th century.\nThe park remains a testament to centuries of landscape design and conservation efforts, blending historical elements with modern ecological awareness."
