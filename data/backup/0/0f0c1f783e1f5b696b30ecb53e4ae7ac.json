There are some more famous High and Low Bridestones elsewhere in the North York Moors national park, in gridsquare SE8791 - however those Bridestones are natural rock formations. The locally popular name of \"Bridestones\" may come from the Norse for being on the brink (edge). There are local legends that explain the stones as petrified bridal parties lost in the mists that hang on the moors. For some reason other visitors have felt the need to hammer coins into the natural cracks in the tallest standing stone."

  "description": "Visit these fascinating sandstone sculptures on this splendid walk in Dalby Forest. The geologically significant area dates back to the Jurassic period 150 million years ago. The Bridestones is a nature reserve with good footpaths taking you around the rocks to woodland and meadows with fabulous views from the reserve's elevated position. The area is run by the National Trust so there is a car park off Dalby Forest Drive near Staindale Lake and Adderstone Wood. From here you can pick up the walking trails taking you up to the stones. It's great in the summer with lots of wildflowers, heather, butterflies and birds to look out for. There are good options for extending your walk. You can pick up the footpath along the Staindale Beck or around Staindale Lake. The wider area of Dalby Forest has several different cycling and walking trails to try. A couple of miles to the west is the wonderful natural amphitheatre of the Hole of Horcum. There's more good trails to follow here through moorland and woodland. Langdale Forest is also just to the east. The Tabular Hills Walk long distance trail also runs past the site. You can follow it Dalby Forest and the Hole of Horcum.",

      "content": "Head north from the site and you can visit High Bridestones on Sleights Moor near Grosmont. There's several fallen megaliths and lovely heather moorland to see here. The moor is located on the Coast to Coast Walk about 2 miles east of Grosmont. The stones date from the Bronze Age with some still standing today. Skelton Tower is located on the western side of Levisham Moor about 2 miles to the north west of the stones. The tower dates from 1830 and sits perched high above the moor in a dramatic and picturesque spot. There are great views over Goathland Moor and the steam trains of the North York Moors Railway below. It's a great spot to take some stunning photos. Just to the north there's the climb to the ancient standing stones and fine viewpoint at Blakey Topping. This circular walk starts from the Crosscliff car park and viewpoint at the northern end of Dalby Forest. For more walking ideas in the area see the North York Moors Walks page."
