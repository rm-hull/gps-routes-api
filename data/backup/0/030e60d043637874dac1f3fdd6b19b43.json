There are splendid views of the Moray Firth and the North Sea. The walk is waymarked with a white bird on a black disc. At Spey Bay the route links up with the Speyside Way. The shared cycling and walking trail will take you south along the river to Aviemore. We've split the walk into manageable day sections - click on the links below to see more information, photos, videos and a map for each section:",

The photogenic castle dates back to the 14th century and is positioned in a dramatic coastal location. The Dava Way also starts in Forres. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line from Forres to Granton-on-Spey, Highland. If you follow it south it will take you towards the Darnaway Forest and the Logie Steading Findhorn River Walk. The estate includes some fine riverside walks, a garden centre, a cafe and some splendid waterfalls at the photogenic Randolph's Leap."
