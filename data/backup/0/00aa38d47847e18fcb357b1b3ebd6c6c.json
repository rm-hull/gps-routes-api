  "description": "Enjoy nice beaches and great coastal views from Beeston Cliffs on this circular walk along the Norfolk coast. After visiting Sheringham the route returns via the Norfolk Coast Path and Beacon Hill, Norfolk's highest point. The walk starts next to the pier in Cromer and heads west along the English Coast Path to Muckle Hill. You continue along the beach to West Runton before coming to Sheringham. Here you can enjoy refreshments before retracing your steps for about half a mile. Then you can pick up a section of the Norfolk Coast Path which climbs south away from the coast. This will take you to the 103 metres (338 ft) high Beacon Hill which is run by the National Trust. There's some nice woodland trails here with great views of the sea. After exploring Beacon Hill the walk descends back into Cromer.",
