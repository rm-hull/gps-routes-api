  "description": "This waterside walk takes you along the Lancaster Canal before visiting the National Trust's Sizergh Castle. The walk starts at Peasey Bridge where the canal joins with the Peasey Beck. From here you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it north towards Sedgwick. There's some lovely countryside surrounding the canal on this section. At Sedgwick you head west along a country lane to cross the River Kent and head to Sizergh Castle. The estate is an excellent place to explore on foot with 1,600-acres of  limestone pasture, orchards and semi-natural woodland. There's also beautiful gardens with a pond, a lake, and a limestone rock garden. After exploring the castle grounds the route returns to Crooklands on the same paths. To extend the walk you could head south along the River Kent to visit Levens Hall where there are more lovely gardens and some splendid topiary. At the start of the walk there's also a nice footpath heading north east along the Peasey Beck if you would like to do some more waterside walking.",
