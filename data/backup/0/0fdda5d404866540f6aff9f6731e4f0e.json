  "description": "This pretty village sits in a fine location on the north Norfolk Coast near Hickling Broad and Happisburgh. There's a lovely blue flag beach, sand dunes and fine countryside views to enjoy in this scenic area. This walk from the village takes you south along the beach to visit one of the area highlights at Horsey Windpump and Horsey Mere. On the way you will pass Marram Hills, Waxham and the Delph Hills before coming to Horsey Gap where you can look out for seals. Here you turn inland to visit the pretty village of Horsey where you will find the National Trust owned mill and mere. You can climb to the top of the historic mill and enjoy a wonderful view over the surrounding countryside of the Norfolk Broads. To continue your walking around Sea Palling head south east to visit Hemsby and Winterton on Sea via the lovely Winterton Dunes.",
