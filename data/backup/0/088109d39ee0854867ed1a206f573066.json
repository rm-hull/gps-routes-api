  "description": "The Kent town of Edenbridge\u00a0is located in a lovely spot for exploring the Eden Valley and the High Weald areas of the county. This walk uses the Eden Valley Walk to visit two highlights of the area at Hever Castle and Penshurst Place . The walk runs for just over 7 miles on a nice waymarked footpath with some short climbs along the way. At the end of the walk you can catch the bus back to the town from Penshurst. The walk starts in the town, close to the train station. From here you can pick up the Eden Valley Walk and follow it east to Hever Castle. The historic castle is surrounded by beautiful grounds with miles of footpaths to follow. After exploring the castle the route continues east past Hill Hoath and the delightful village of Chiddingstone . This National Trust owned village includes a number of quaint timber framed Tudor buildings, a picturesque village pond, an ancient pub and the 15th century Chiddingstone Castle with its beautiful grounds and gardens. You could take a small detour north from the route to explore the settlement. Shortly after passing Hill Hoath you will come to Penshurst. It's a lovely place for a walk with fine views of the medieval manor house and the River Medway. There's also several pretty lakes and nice woodland trails in the north eastern section of the park. After exploring the grounds the route returns to Edenbridge on the same paths. To continue your walking around the town you could visit the nearby Staffhurst Wood where there are miles of peaceful woodland trails. You can reach the woods from the town by following the Eden Valley Walk and the Vanguard Way which also runs through the area.",
