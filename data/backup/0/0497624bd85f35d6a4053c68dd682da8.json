  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Monsal Dale in the Derbyshire Dales. It's a very scenic spot with woodland trails and riverside paths along a lovely section of the River Wye. Look out for wildlife including dippers and kingfishers as you make your way along the river. Start the walk from the Monsal Head car park behind the hotel of the same name. From here you pick up footpaths heading north west to cross the viaduct over to the other side of the River Wye. You can then follow a path along the river heading west through the Dale to Brushfield Hough and Lees Bottom. This section includes an impressive rushing weir. At Lees Bottom you turn around to follow alternative footpaths back along the northern edge of the Dale. These will lead you back towards Monsal Head where you cross the river on a different footbridge. Head east and you can visit the village of Little Longstone before picking up a section of the Monsal Trail to return to the car park.",
