  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Snape Maltings Nature Reserve from the coastal town of Aldeburgh in Suffolk. It's about a 7 mile walk from the town to the reserve, using a section of the waymarked Suffolk Coast Path and the Sailor's Path. The path is so named because historically sailors would walk the route on their way home. It's a well signed and maintained path which runs through an AONB. The walk starts on the sea front in Aldeburgh, next to the lifeboat station. From here you head north along the beach before turning left to follow the waymarked footpath toward the golf course. You then follow the trail through Blackheath Wood where there's some nice woodland trails and the Sailor's Path Cottages. The final section of the walk runs through Snape Warren before crossing Snape Bridge to finish at The Maltings. The attractive area includes reedbeds, wet woodland and marshland with lots of wildlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for woodlark, yellowhammer and nightjar. The area also includes an expansive arts complex on the banks of the\u00a0River Alde. It's best known for its concert hall, which is one of the main sites of the annual\u00a0Aldeburgh Festival. The complex also includes shops, galleries and restaurants where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. To continue your walking in the Aldeburgh area you could try the popular Aldeburgh to Thorpeness Walk and visit Thorpeness Meare and the North Warren RSPB reserve. Just to the south of The Maltings there's miles of nice trails to try in Tunstall Forest . Also nearby is the lovely Orford Ness Nature Reserve which includes shingle, salt-marsh, mud-flats and brackish lagoons.",
