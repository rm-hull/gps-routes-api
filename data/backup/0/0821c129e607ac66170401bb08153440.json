  "description": "This lovely waterside walk follows the Yeading Brook through the London Borough of Hillingdon. This section of the path is known as the Willow Tree Wander. It runs for about 5 miles from Ickenham Marsh to North Harrow.  You can reach the marsh from Ickenham Station by following the Hillingdon Trail for about 5 minutes. The trail then heads east, following the brook through Ruislip Gardens, Rayners Lane and Roxbourne Park before finishing at North Harrow station. It's a nice easy stroll with the pleasant stream surrounded by interesting vegetation. To extend your walk you can follow the Hillingdon Trail south from Ickenham to Yeading Brook Meadows nature reserve.  The pretty reserve consists of grassland and wild flowers such as the narrow-leaved water dropwort and common spotted orchid.  Next to it you will find ten acre wood nature reserve where you will find meadow, marsh and woodland with wildlife such as hobbies and kingfishers to look out for.",
