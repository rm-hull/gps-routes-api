  "description": "A circular walk from Brancaster taking you to Brancaster Bay and the Titchwell Nature Reserve on the Norfolk coast. Start the walk from the village and then follow footpaths north up to the beach. There are views to The Royal West Norfolk Golf Club over the sea wall on your eastern side here. At the beach turn west and you will pass along the dunes to the nature reserve where there are lots of water channels and interesting wildlife to look out for. The route then takes you south along Gypsy Lane before heading east along the pavement of the A road to take you back into Brancaster.",
