A wide swathe of ground has recently been cleared of scrub and rhododendrons by the Forestry Commission between the forest on the left and the adjacent road on the right. The stretch of road known as Rhododendron Mile is just behind the bushes on the right and a 20m strip of the flowering bushes has been left along the road to maintain this tourist attraction. This clearance will prevent the spread of the rhododendrons into the forest where it would choke the ground cover."

  "description": "This large area of woodland near Dorchester has miles of footpaths and mountain bike trails. There are a number of easy walking trails and some more challenging climbs to Green Hill and Beacon Hill. If you are on a moutain bike you can enjoy miles of bridleways, short natural singletracks, downhill sections and some jumps. The forest is located just to the west of the village of Puddletown and the River Piddle. It is a nice walk to do if you are visiting Thomas Hardy's cottage which is located on the western fringe of the forest. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could try our Thorncombe Woods Walk . This visits the pretty Rushy Pond and Duddle Heath where there are fine views over the open countryside surrounding the forest. You could also visit the nearby Athelhampton House . Here you can explore the beautiful parkland and gardens surrounding the 15th century Athelhampton House. National Cycle Network Route 2 runs just to the south of the forest.",
