  "description": "This lovely circular waterside walk takes you along both sides of the River Soar in the city centre of Leicester. It's a lovely area for a stroll with 2 beautiful parks and the Grand Union Canal to visit as well. The walk starts on the pretty bridge in Abbey Park which spans the river. Here you will find formal gardens, a sensory garden, a boating lake, a model boat lake and a miniature railway. Follow the riverside paths north to Ellis Meadows and then on to Watermead Country Park. It's a real highlight of the area with over 12 lakes and ponds, wildflower meadows, woodland, grassland and reedbeds set in 350 acres of parkland. After exploring the park the route heads south along the other side of the Soar, passing the canal in Belgrave before returning to Abbey Park. Here you can visit the historic Abbey Grounds with the remains of the twelfth century Leicester Abbey, and the ruins of Cavendish House, a seventeenth century mansion. There's also a fine cafe where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. To continue your walking in the area try our Loughborough Canal Walk which runs to Barrow upon Soar and Loughborough along both the river and the canal.",

There's much to see here with a popular maze, a Rural Centre with a large garden centre, a model village, a cafe/bistro, a Mediterranean deli, an art gallery and a notable 12th century church. There's also nice paths along the Grand Union Canal and the River Sence to enjoy. Head south along the river and you could visit Aylestone Meadows. The large local nature reserve has more nice riverside trails with grazing horses and lot of wildlife to see. If you head east towards Oadby and Wigston there's a pleasant community orchard and pretty meadows to explore at Brocks Hill Country Park. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks page."
