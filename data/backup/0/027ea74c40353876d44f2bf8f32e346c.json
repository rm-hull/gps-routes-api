Some wonderful poppy head bench ends in the chancel and a strange curiosity ... a large allegorical painting of the defeat of the Spanish Armada. Painted soon after 1588 by Robert Stephenson, it depicts a red dragon, ships & soldiers and an inscription recounting the defeat. It's hard to see the detail high up on the west wall, but there are postcards for sale."

  "description": "This walk visits the historic Gunby Hall Estate in the Lincolnshire Wolds. The National Trust owned hall dates back to 1700 and is a Grade I listed building. The expansive estate covers 1500 acres with countryside trails and 8 acres of beautiful gardens. Features include a Victorian Walled Garden, a Kitchen Garden, wildflower meadows, an ice house pond, herbaceous borders and the remains of Gunby village which dates back to the 16th century. In February there's also the popular snowdrop walks around the gardens to enjoy. You can also explore the stately home with its fine furniture and paintings. The house was home to the Massingberd family for over 250 years before being gifted to the National Trust in 1944. There is a fee for entrance to the house and gardens but there are also public footpaths running across the estate. This walk follows one such path south to the village of Bratoft. Here you will pass the 18th century church and the remains of Bratoft Manor where the Massingberd family lived before they moved into Gunby. On the way there are some fine views of the surrounding countryside of the Lincolnshire Wolds AONB.",
