  "description": "This is a fairly easy walk from West to East Sussex through heathland, farmland and forest. The walk runs from Midhurst to Heathfield and passes through Petworth, Billinghurst, Haywards Heath, Lindfield and Nutley. It was created by the Sussex Ramblers Association to celebrate their 60th anniversary. Highlights on the walk include Petworth Park which holds the 'National Trust's finest art collection displayed in a magnificent 17th century mansion within a beautiful 700-acre park'. This can be found on the first leg of the journey from Midhurst to Petworth. The walk also includes pleasant waterside sections along the River Arun near Billingshurst and then along the upper reaches of the River Ouse at Lindfield. There are also several wooded sections including Flexham Park, Sheffield Forest and a number of other smaller woods dotted along the route.",
