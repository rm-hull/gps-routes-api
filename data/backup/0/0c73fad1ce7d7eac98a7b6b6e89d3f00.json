  "description": "This south Yorkshire town is a fine place for a walk with a historic ruined castle, riverside trail and an impressive disused viaduct to visit. This circular walk visits the Conisbrough Viaduct before heading to the nearby Sprotbrough Falls and the medieval castle. You can start the walk from the train station and then cross the river to the opposite side on the footbridge. Here you can pick up the Trans Pennine Trail and follow the waymarked trail east along the River Don to the viaduct. The structure was opened in 1909, and is 1,527 feet in length with 21 arches. From the top of the viaduct there are excellent views over the surrounding Don Valley countryside. The route then continues along the Don, passing Cadeby and the Dolomite Quarry before coming to the Pot Ridings Wood Nature Reserve where there are woodland trails and wildlife spotting opportunities. Near here you'll also pass Sprotbrough Falls where there's locks and rushing weirs to admire. The walk then crosses Sprotbrough Bridge to the other side of the river before heading south past Levitthagg Wood and Warmsworth. The route continues past Butterbusk Green and the viaduct to take you to the medieval ruins of Conisbrough Castle. From the elevated position of the castle keep there are excellent views back to the viaduct. From the castle it is then a short walk back to the train station where the walk finishes.",
