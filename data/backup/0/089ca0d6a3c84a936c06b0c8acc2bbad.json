  "description": "This attractive Kent based village has a pretty village green, a local community run woodland park and easy access to the footpaths on the North Downs. The village is also easily accessible with a train station on the Southeastern Maidstone East Line. It's located just two miles east of Maidstone town centre. This circular walk from the village visits the Bearsted Woodland Trust before heading up to the North Downs Way to visit neighbouring Thurnham where you can visit the ruins of Thurnham Castle. The walk starts in the village centre where you can visit the Bearsted Woodland Trust on the eastern side. There's some nice trails to follow around this pleasant area with a lake, ponds, cherry tree avenue and streams to see. After exploring the woodland park you can follow footpaths north east to Barton Farm before heading underneath the motorway to Longham Wood. Continue north for another mile or so and you will come to the North Downs Way. You can follow the waymarked trail west to Civiley Wood before coming to the remains of Thurnham Castle. This 12th-century flint-built castle was constructed by Robert of Thurnham in the reign of Henry II. One side of the bailey wall still stands 10 foot high and originally it enclosed an area of about a quarter of an acre. After exploring the castle you could continue west for a short distance to climb to the viewpoint on Detling Hill in the White Horse Wood Country Park. This route follows Thurnham Lane south to return to the village.",
