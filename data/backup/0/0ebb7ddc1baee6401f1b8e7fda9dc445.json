  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk or cycle around this large man made lake in the Derbyshire Peak District. There's a good sized car park off the Woodhead Road on the southern side of the water. From here you can pick up the Longdendale Trail to take you along the water. On the northern side of the reservoir you can follow footpaths along the water if you are on foot. If you're on a bike the A628 runs above the reservoir giving great views across the area. To extend your walk you can visit the other adjacent reservoirs. This includes Bottoms, Woodhead, Valehouse and Rhodeswood reservoir. You could also pick up the Pennine Way and head north to Chew Reservoir and Saddleworth Moor. The climb to Bleaklow also starts from the Torside car park. From the Bleaklow Head summit there are wonderful far reaching views over Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Cheshire and the Hope Valley. The reservoirs are located just to the north of the popular town of Glossop. You can virtually explore the area on the google street view link below.",

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "On the northern side of the reservoir you will find the hamlet of Crowden which is a popular start point for many walks. For example you could try the Crowden Black Hill Walk which climbs to the highest point in the historic county of Cheshire. The trail also passes Black Chew Head, the highest point in Greater Manchester. At the eastern end of Woodhead Reservoir there's another car park where you can start the Middle Black Clough Waterfall Walk. The area is a bit of a hidden gem with walks along the River Etherow to some beautiful waterfalls and wonderful rock formations. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
