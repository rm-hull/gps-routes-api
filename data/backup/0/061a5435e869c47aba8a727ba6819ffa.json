  "description": "This walk takes you along the Uig Woodland trail on the Isle of Skye. The trail also leads into Glen Conon where there are some nice riverside paths and a waterfall to see. The walk starts next to the River Rha and the football pitch in the village. From here you can pick up a footpath heading east through the peaceful woodland with views to Uig Bay to the south. You can then cross the bridge over the Conon to enter the Conon Nature Reserve where there is a further footpath along the river leading to a waterfall. Along the way you can look out and listen for a variety of woodland birds and other wildlife. Just to the south you can extend your walk on the Fairy Glen Walk. It's a beautiful place with waterfalls and pretty pools surrounded by picturesque little hills. Just to the north there's also the lovely Falls Of Rha, another local scenic highlight.",
