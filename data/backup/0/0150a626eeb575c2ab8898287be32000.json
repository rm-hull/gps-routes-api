  "description": "With over 10 miles of well signed cycling and walking tracks, Black Park is the ideal place for a great day out in the country. Set in 535 acres of woodland and heathland, you will find lakes, picnic areas, cafes and a Go Ape Tree top adventure course. The park is located in Wexham, just a few miles east of Slough. The route below begins at the car park next to the lake and takes you to the famous Pinewood studios where many blockbuster films have been produced. You continue through the park to Upton Wood where you will circle the lake before returning to the finish point back at the car park. The route is suitable for both cyclists and walkers but for cyclists there is also the Beeches cycleway. This 12 mile, signposted route joins Black Park, Stoke Common, Burnham Beeches and Dorney Lake allowing you to extend your ride if you wish. For walkers you may also like to try the Beeches way walk which passes through Black Park. Also of interest is the nearby Langley Park Country Park which lies just to the south of Black Park.",

The Celandine Route also runs just to the east of the trail. It will take you along the River Pinn from Pinner to Cowley. To the north is Gerrards Cross where there's some nice trails on the town's common and a fine 17th century commonside pub to visit afterwards. For more walking ideas in the area see the Buckinghamshire Walks page."
