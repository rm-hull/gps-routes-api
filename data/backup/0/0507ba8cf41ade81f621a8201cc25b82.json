  "description": "This large forest in Tadley covers nearly 500 acres. It is criss crossed with numerous footpaths ideal for a peaceful stroll. The area consists of Oak and Birch ancient woodland and heathland. The pretty Honeymill Brook also runs through the forest. The area is great for wildlife with many species of butterfly to look out for. White admiral, purple emperor and silver-washed fritillary are just a few you may see as you make your way through the woods. Birds such as Blackcap and Green woodpeckers are regular visitors to the woods too. Interesting flora includes wild daffodils, honeysuckle and lovely purple heather. This circular route is more suited for walking but on the eastern side of the forest you will find a bridleway which is good for cycling. This runs from Pamber heath to Bridle's Copse, passing Silchester Common on the way. The Brenda Parker Way runs through the woods so you could pick up this long distance footpath to extend your walking in the area. If you follow the path north east you will come to the fascinating Silchester Roman Town (Calleva Atrebatum). The town's ruined walls are still visible as are the remains of the amphitheatre, added about AD 70-80 and situated outside the city walls. You can see more information on this on the Silchester Walk page. If you head west you'll come to the pretty Ashford Hill Nature Reserve where there are more nice woodland trails.",

Just a few miles to the north you can pick up the towpath of the Kennet and Avon Canal at the lovely Aldermaston Wharf. The circular Bramley Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the forest.
