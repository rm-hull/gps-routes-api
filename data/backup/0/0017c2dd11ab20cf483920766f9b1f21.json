It can be reached only by climbing a ladder attached to the rock face. The rock is associated with several Cornish legends including the story of Jan Tregeagle whose ghostly body got stuck in the east window when he was trying to gain sanctuary from the hell hounds on his trail. The Omen film, \"The Final Conflict\" was filmed here."

  "description": "This circular walk visits the geologically significant Roche Rock in Cornwall. The granite outcrop is something of a local landmark, standing at a height of 20-metres (66-feet). The walk starts in the village of Roche and then heads a short distance south to visit the ancient rock and chapel. Here you can climb a ladder for a close up view of the rock and enjoy views over the surrounding countryside. At the top you'll find a ruined chapel (dedicated to St Michael) which is said to have been the abode of a leper or a monk. After enjoying the views you continue towards Hendra and Carbis before following a country lane towards Broadlanes. From here it is a short stroll west back into Roche.",

Just to the south of the tor you can explore the popular Luxulyan Valley, a designated World Heritage Site. The valley is one of the highlights of the area with nice trails along the River Par, a series of historical industrial remains and the impressive Treffry Viaduct to see. Also nearby is the splendid Lanhydrock and the town of Lostwithiel. A few miles to the west you can pick up the Goss Moor Trail. This shared cycling and walking trail explores the expansive Goss Moor National Nature Reserve where there's a number of rare plant and wildlife species to look out for. For more walking ideas in the area see the Bodmin Moor Walks and Cornwall Walks pages."
