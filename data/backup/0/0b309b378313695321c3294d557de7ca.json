  "description": "This 280 acre reservoir has a super circular walking path to try. The path runs quite close to the lake along the northern side with country trails to follow around the eastern and southern side. The western end of the reservoir is a protected nature reserve and bird sanctuary designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Habitats include strips of open grassland, scrub and woodland. Low lying meadows also form part of the reserve. Look out for kingfisher, tern, osprey, teal swifts, swallows and whitethroat. The reservoir is located just to the west of Forest Row and about 7 miles north east of Haywards Heath. The Forest Way and the Sussex Border Path both run past the reservoir so you could easily pick up either of these trails if you'd like to continue your walk. If you head north you'll soon come to the National Trust owned Standen House. The Standen Estate has 100 acres of parkland, gardens and woodland to explore and is well worth a visit.",
