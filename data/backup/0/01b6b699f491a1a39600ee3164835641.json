    "description": "This circular cycling and walking route takes you around the lovely Talybont Reservoir in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The route makes use of National Cycle Route 8 and the Taff Trail to take you around the 318 acres (1.29 km2) reservoir. You start off at the northern end of the reservoir, near the dam, where roadside parking is available. You then climb through the woodland area on the eastern side of the water, along the Taff Trail. There are splendid views over the water to the surrounding hills and beautiful waterfalls near Abercynafon at the southern end of the reservoir. The return leg follows a country lane along the western side of the water and Talybont Forest. If you would like to extend your walk then you could continue west along the Taff Trail to the beautiful Blaen y Glyn Waterfalls. For fine views over the area climb to Tor Y Foel on the eastern flank.",

The White Hart is an historic Coaching Inn which has welcomed travelers for over 300 years. Located near the canal it has an extensive menu and a nice outdoor seating area. After your meal you could enjoy a gentle stroll along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal which runs past the pub. The inn is dog friendly so you can bring your pooch. You can find the pub at postcode LD3 7JD for your sat navs. The Usk Inn is another great option. The old pub was established in the 1840s at the time of the Brecon to Merthyr Railway. It has an enviable position on the edge of the village, opposite the former railway station and yard. There's a friendly welcome and a large garden area to relax in on warmer days. You can find the pub at postcode LD3 7JE."

Llangorse is the largest natural lake in Wales and includes a nature reserve with wildflowers and lots of birds to look out for on the water. There's also an interesting old lakeside church and a fine on site cafe. You can also visit the nearby little village of Llangors where there's 2 fine pubs to consider. Also in this area are the climbs to Mynydd Troed, Dragons Back and Waun Fach the highest mountain in the Black Mountains. The popular Usk Valley Walk passes the northern tip of the lake. The long distance trail runs from Caerleon to Brecon along the river. For more walking ideas in the area see the Brecon Beacons Walks page."
