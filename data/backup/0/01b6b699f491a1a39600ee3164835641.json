  "description": "This circular cycling and walking route takes you around the lovely Talybont Reservoir in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The route makes use of National Cycle Route 8 and the Taff Trail to take you around the 318 acres (1.29 km2) reservoir. You start off at the northern end of the reservoir, near the dam, where roadside parking is available. You then climb through the woodland area on the eastern side of the water, along the Taff Trail. There are splendid views over the water to the surrounding hills and beautiful waterfalls near Abercynafon at the southern end of the reservoir. The return leg follows a country lane along the western side of the water and Talybont Forest. If you would like to extend your walk then you could continue west along the Taff Trail to the beautiful Blaen y Glyn Waterfalls. For fine views over the area climb to Tor Y Foel on the eastern flank.",
