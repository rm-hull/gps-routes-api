There are also a number of peaceful woodland trails and an excellent visitor centre. The Tees Link and Guisborough Forest and Walkway country park are nearby so there is scope for continuing your walk. The climb to Eston Nab also starts from Flatts Lane Country Park. It's a nice climb with splendid views over Middlesbrough, Roseberry Topping, Urra Moor and the Yorkshire coast.",

      "content": "The Middlesbrough Walk starts from Middlesbrough Dock on the River Tees and follows the Tees Link to the park. It then visits Ormesby Hall just to the west of the park. The National Trust owned hall is a Grade I listed building, described as a classic Georgian Mansion built in the Palladian style. There's 250 acres of parkland and farmland to explore on a network of footpaths. Near here there's also the noteworthy Stewart Park. There's 120 acres of parkland here with mature woodland, an arboretum and lakes with wildfowl. The park also includes the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum where you can learn about the history of British naval explorer and circumnavigator Captain James Cook. The explorer achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands, and the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand. The Cleveland Street Walk can be picked up in Guisborough at the historic priory ruins. The photogenic ruins are run by English Heritage and are well worth a visit."
