  "description": "This walk visits Loch Ardinning in Stirling. This pretty loch is a pleasant place for a stroll with some east footpaths and lovely views across the water. The loch is managed by the Scottish Wildlife trust and is a great place for flora and fauna. Look out for woodpeckers and black grouse plus various butterflies fluttering around the reserve's wildflowers. You can start your walk at the parking area at the western end of the loch and then follow paths east along the northern shore.",
