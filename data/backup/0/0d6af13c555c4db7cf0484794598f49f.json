Trade in Godalming was greatly enhanced when, in the spring of 1764, the Godalming Navigation was opened, connecting the town to the already existing Wey Navigation at Guildford. The Wharf became a hive of activity as bulk goods such as timber were loaded on to barges there. Although this commercial trade has now ended, Godalming Wharf is today the most southerly navigable point on the main canal and river network of England and is very popular with users of pleasure craft."

  "description": "A nice waterside walk from Guildford to Godalming along the River Wey Navigation Canal. It's just over a four mile walk so ideal for an afternoon stroll. The walk starts near the train station in Guildford, which is located very close to the canal. You then follow the Wey South Path south to Shalford and then Broadford, where you follow the canal branch to the right. You continue past Peasmarsh towards Broadwater where you will pass Broadwater Lake and cricket ground in Farncombe. The final section takes you past Lammas Lands into Godalming. Here you can catch the train back if you wish. To extend your walking in the area you can try the Fox Way circular trail. It passes through Guildford and Godalming, taking you on a tour of the surrounding countryside, woodland and canals. At Broadford you have the option of heading left along the Wey South Path and heading towards Cranleigh .",
