  "description": "This fabulous 170 mile national cycle network route takes you right across the country from west to east coast along off road paths and quiet country roads. You start at Morecambe Bay in Lancashire on the west coast and head towards Lancaster where you join the River Lune for a lovely off road waterside stretch. You soon enter the beautiful Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The landscape here is simply stunning and there is also a variety of wildlife to look out for on this section. The route then continues into the equally wonderful Yorkshire Dales National Park with more gorgeous countryside and a series of charming Yorkshire villages to enjoy. A real treat awaits near Ripon where you will pass the fascinating National Trust owned Fountains Abbey - this 12th century ruined Cistercian monastery is a real route highlight and is an ideal place to stop for a rest and refreshments. From Ripon you continue through Yorkshire along the River Ouse taking you into the historic city of York. The final stretch takes you through the beautiful Yorkshire Wolds with the lovely Millington Pastures and the interesting 17th century manor house at Burton Agnes Hall , two of the highlights. The route finishes on the prom at the coastal town of Bridlington."
