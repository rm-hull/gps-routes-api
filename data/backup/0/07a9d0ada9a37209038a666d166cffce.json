  "description": "This popular walk follows the Cuilcagh Boardwalk or 'Stairway to Heaven' on Cuilcagh Mountain in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. It's a fascinating area with interesting flora and splendid limestone scenery to enjoy on the way above the blanket bog. After making your way along the boardwalk you begin a final ascent along a series of steep steps to the Cuilcagh viewpoint. You can start the walk from the car park at Marlbank Road at postcode BT92 1ER. Then pick up the boardwalk heading south for a distance of just over 4 miles until you reach the wonderful viewpoint at the end. The area is also great for rare wildlife so keep your eyes peeled for Eurasian golden plover the Merlin, one of the smallest birds of prey. For a longer circular walk see the Cuilcagh Mountain Walk .",

      "content": "Just to the north there's the wonderful Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark. The Geopark features various sites which demonstrate the geological and wider natural heritage of the area, as well as the cultural heritage relating to 7,000\u20138,000 years of recorded human occupation since the last ice age. This includes a number of show caves which exhibit a wide range of classic cave features. The natural limestone caves are named after the nearby Marble Arch, a natural limestone arch at the upstream end of Cladagh Glen under which the Cladagh River flows. See the Cladagh Glen and Marble Arch Caves Walk for more details. Head north to Lough Erne and you could pay a visit to Lough Navar Forest. There's a woodland sculpture trail leading to an impressive 20 foot high waterfall here. The forest lies in the Cliffs of Magho where there is an excellent viewpoint with views over the lough and its islands to the coast. On the other side of the lake there's also Castle Archdale. The historic country park estate includes a fascinating museum, pretty gardens and some lovely waterside trails along the lough. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northern Ireland Walks page."
