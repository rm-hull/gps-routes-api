This is probably a small\u00a0Bronze Age\u00a0burial mound. A small cairn has been built on top of it,\u00a0but was not there in the 1950s, when a dead tree trunk marked the spot.\nThe isolated position of the fell makes it a splendid viewpoint.\u00a0Blencathra\u00a0and the Dodds dominate the view towards the west, while to the south is an impressive vista of both the Far Eastern and the Eastern Fells, as far as Red Screes and the\u00a0Kirkstone Pass. To the east, beyond\u00a0Little Mell Fell\u00a0there is a clear view across the Eden Valley to the north Pennines."

  "description": "This walk climbs to Great Mell Fell in the Lake District National Park. The fell is located just west of Ullswater and stands at a height of 537 metres. It is owned by the National Trust and commands fine views over the surrounding fells. The fell also includes pleasant woodland areas where you can look out for wildlife including roe deer and green woodpeckers. You can start the walk at the roadside parking area next to Brownrigg Farm. Then follow footpaths north west through the woodland to the hill top, passing Routing Gill on the way. You can extend the walk by heading east to visit Little Mell Fell and south to Gowbarrow Fell as shown in the video below.",
