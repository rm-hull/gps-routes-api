      "caption": "The summit cairn of Great Mell Fell. Saddleback also known as Blencathra is the mountain just right of centre. The summit is crowned by a low mound, marked as a tumulus. This is probably a small Bronze Age burial mound. A small cairn has been built on top of it, but was not there in the 1950s, when a dead tree trunk marked the spot. The isolated position of the fell makes it a splendid viewpoint. Blencathra and the Dodds dominate the view towards the west, while to the south is an impressive vista of both the Far Eastern and the Eastern Fells, as far as Red Screes and the Kirkstone Pass. To the east, beyond Little Mell Fell there is a clear view across the Eden Valley to the north Pennines."

  "description": "This walk climbs to Great Mell Fell in the Lake District National Park. The fell is located just west of Ullswater and stands at a height of 537 metres. It is owned by the National Trust and commands fine views over the surrounding fells. The fell also includes pleasant woodland areas where you can look out for wildlife including roe deer and green woodpeckers. You can start the walk at the roadside parking area next to Brownrigg Farm. Then follow footpaths north west through the woodland to the hill top, passing Routing Gill on the way. You can extend the walk by heading east to visit Little Mell Fell and south to Gowbarrow Fell as shown in the video below.",
