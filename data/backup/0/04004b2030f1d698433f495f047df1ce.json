  "description": "This circular walk visits a popular beauty spot on the Lune River in Lancaster. The route runs for about 3 miles on flat paths so is suitable for most abilities. It's a lovely area with views of the river, the old bridges and the surrounding countryside. The walk starts from the car park at the site where there's good facilities including toilets, picnic area and a cafe. From here you can pick up the Lune Valley Ramble and follow the waymarked trail north east along the river. After about a mile you'll come to a bridge which you can use to cross to the south side of the water. You can then follow footpaths south east back to the start point, passing through some small areas of woodland on the way. Aughton Woods is located close to the Crook at the north eastern end of the walk. There's lots of pretty bluebells and primroses to see here. You can also look out for wildlife including chiffchaffs, chaffinches and five species of tit.",
