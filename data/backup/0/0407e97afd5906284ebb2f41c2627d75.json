  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the spectacular Gordale Scar in the Yorkshire Dales. It's a popular walk through a wonderful limestone ravine with streams, waterfalls and striking geological features to enjoy. The unique area is about 16 million years old and has its own micro-climate which allows rare wildflowers and plants to thrive iin the gorge. The circular trail runs for just over 4 miles and includes some moderate climbs and a bit of a scramble around the waterfall so a reasonable level of fitness is required. You start in the pretty village of Malham and follow Gordale Lane and Gordale Beck north east to Gordale Scar. Here you will find two waterfalls and overhanging limestone cliffs over 100 metres high. It's a truly stunning sight and well worth the climb from Malham. From Gordale Scar you continue the climb towards Seaty Hill where there are magnificent views of the Yorkshire Dales. The final section descends along country lanes to Malham Village. If you'd like to extend your walking in the area then you could visit Malham Cove and the Malham Tarn Estate for more beautiful scenery. You can also try the Janet's Foss Walk where you can follow a nice footpath  along a pretty beck and through garlic scented woodland to the falls. See the video below for more details of this walk.",
