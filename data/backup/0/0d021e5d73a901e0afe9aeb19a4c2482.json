The walk visits some of the best countryside in the region including hopyards, vineyards and orchards. There are also splendid views of the Rivers Severn, Lugg and Wye and a section through the beautiful Malvern Hills to enjoy. The walk is waymarked with a white disc featuring musical notes.",

The noteworthy Greenman dates from 1485 so has over 500 years of history including links to the Civil War. They do excellent food and have a garden area for finer days. You can find the pub at postcode HR1 4PE for your sat navs. The New Inn is also nearby in the village. The friendly pub also does good food and has a large lawned garden area for outdoor refreshments. It's dog friendly too if you have your canine friend with you."
