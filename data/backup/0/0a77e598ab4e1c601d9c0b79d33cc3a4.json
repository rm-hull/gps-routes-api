  "description": "This large area of woodland is located a few miles north east of Oxford city centre. It's a nice peaceful place to go for a walk if you are visiting the area. In the woods you'll find a number of footpaths including a Butterfly trail where you can look out for over 40 species of butterfly. You can start the walk at the car park on Oakley Road (postcode below). From here you can pick up the trails heading through Oakley Wood, Shabbington Wood and Waterperry Wood to the south. The Bernwood Jubilee Way also runs through the forest. This waymarked, long distance trail was devised to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee. It runs for 61 miles and explores the area that was once The Royal Hunting Forest of Bernwood.",
