  "description": "Enjoy a lovely circular walk around this 130 acre reservoir in Littleborough. There is some beautiful scenery surrounding the lake and a nature reserve with a bird hide. You can also try kayaking and windsurfing on the lake with equipment available for hire. The Rochdale Way walking route passes through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk. The Rochdale Canal also passes near the lake so you could continue your waterside exercise along the towpath. The circular South Pennine Water Trail also takes in the lake, the canal and the Ealees Valley. It's a great way to explore this attractive area of the South Pennines. If you head south from the lake you will soon come to the lovely Ogden Reservoir and Piethorne Reservoir. There's a nice circular trail around the reservoirs with great views over the Piethorne Valley.",
