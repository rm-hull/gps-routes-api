  "description": "This large area of woodland near has miles of cycling and walking trails to enjoy. You can park at West Stow Country Park and pick up the Icknield Way Path which runs through the woods along the Westtow Road track. The woods are great for wildlife with Fallow, Red, Roe and Muntjac deer to look out for. You may also see foxes and badgers. Birdwatchers may see Owl, Warblers, Finches, Goldcrests, Great Spotted and Green Woodpecker, Treecreeper, Nuthatch and Buzzards. To extend your walking in the are you can further explore West Stow Country Park. It's right next to the woods and includes waterside trails through the Lackford Lakes Nature Reserve and along the River Lark. Also nearby is the pretty Cavenham Heath Nature Reserve. The reserve has nice trails through heathland with more wildlife to look out for. The long distance Lark Valley Path also runs through the area so you could pick this up and enjoy a riverside walk through Suffolk.",
