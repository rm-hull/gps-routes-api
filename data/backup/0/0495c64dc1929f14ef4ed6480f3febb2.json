  "description": "This Monmouthshire village sits in a fine location in the lovely Wye Valley AONB. This walk from the village takes you along a section of the Wye Valley Walk to Tintern Old Station and the historic Tintern Abbey. The walk starts in the village and first heads west to visit Cleddon Falls on the River Cleddon. The pretty falls are located just a short walk from the village and are an impressive sight after rain. You'll then head south to pass through Bargain Wood and Coed Beddick on your way to the two local highlights. The photogenic rail station has been converted into a park with three old rail carriages used as a gift shop and a museum with old railway memorabilia. There's also some pleasant footpaths to follow around the site. The abbey lies just south of here around the bend of the river. The ruins of this 12th century monastery are a fine place for a stroll, with views of the river and the surrounding woodland of the Forest of Dean. Near the Old Station there's also the option of taking a detour to visit the neighbouring village of Brockweir which sits on the eastern side of the river on the English side.",
