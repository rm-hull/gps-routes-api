  "description": "This walk visits the Worcestershire village of Flyford Flavell and the Grafton Wood Nature Reserve. The reserve is located a short stroll from the village. Just follow the Wychavon Way north west for about half a mile and you will reach the site. Here you can enjoy some pleasant woodland trails with lots of wildlife to see. Highlights include the rare brown hairstreak butterfly and Bechstein's bat. There are also lots of pretty bluebells to see during the spring months. To continue your walking in the area head to neighbouring Inkberrow where you'll find a picturesque village green, a historic church and a fine local pub. The settlement is notable as the model for Ambridge, the setting of BBC Radio 4's long-running series The Archers. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Flyford Flavell. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",

      "content": "More about the reserve: In partnership with Butterfly Conservation, Grafton plays a pivotal role in one of Worcestershire's key conservation achievements. The woodland is home to the Midlands' sole population of brown hairstreak butterflies. Active in August and September, these rare butterflies have been the focus of a dedicated conservation effort. Collaborating with local landowners and promoting proper hedgerow care, volunteers from both charities have contributed to the expansion and population growth of these butterflies. Grafton Wood is a historic, semi-natural woodland with broad-leaved trees, managed until the 1950s as coppice-with-standards for producing various items like broom handles and clothes pegs. Present-day management practices aim to continue this traditional approach, including widening the woodland paths, coppicing, and forming clearings. Efforts are made to preserve areas with young blackthorn bushes, crucial for the survival of brown hairstreak butterflies. The dominant canopy trees are ash and oak, with a remarkable ancient small-leaved lime coppice stool, believed to have originated from a single lime tree over a thousand years ago. The woodland also features a dense undergrowth of field maple, hawthorn, and hazel. However, Grafton Wood isn't just a haven for brown hairstreak butterflies. It's a vital habitat for other woodland butterflies such as silver-washed fritillaries and white admirals, as well as a range of noteworthy moths like the drab looper and rosy footman. The wood records various fungi species and is known for its unique flora, including herb-paris and bird\u2019s-nest orchid. Regular bird sightings include buzzards, goldcrests, and woodpeckers, while the nearby meadows and orchards are vital for green woodpeckers. The recent discovery of Bechstein\u2019s bats in the wood has marked it as the most northerly breeding roost for this species in the UK."
