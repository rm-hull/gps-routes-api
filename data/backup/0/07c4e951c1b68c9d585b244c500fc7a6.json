  "description": "This walk visits the Worcestershire village of Flyford Flavell and the Grafton Wood Nature Reserve. The reserve is located a short stroll from the village. Just follow the Wychavon Way north west for about half a mile and you will reach the site. Here you can enjoy some pleasant woodland trails with lots of wildlife to see. Highlights include the rare brown hairstreak butterfly and Bechstein's bat. There are also lots of pretty bluebells to see during the spring months. To continue your walking in the area head to neighbouring Inkberrow where you'll find a picturesque village green, a historic church and a fine local pub. The settlement is notable as the model for Ambridge, the setting of BBC Radio 4's long-running series The Archers. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Flyford Flavell. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
