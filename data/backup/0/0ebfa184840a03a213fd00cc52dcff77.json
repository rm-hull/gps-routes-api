  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this attractive area of woodland near Worcester. There are miles of good woodland trails, a riverside path along the River Severn and several large ponds to enjoy. The woods are very popular with walkers during the springtime as you will find carpets of pretty bluebells. The area near the village hall is known as the grove and has a stream running through a lovely wooded valley, with lots of pretty flowers and vegetation. The Severn Way runs past the woods so you can pick this up to extend your walk. The woods are located close to Stourport-on-Severn where you will find Hartlebury Common which has more nice woodland trails to try. Our Stourport Circular Walk visits the common, the River Severn and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. You could also visit Witley Court which is located only a few miles to the west. Here you will find a palatial 19th century mansion surrounded by beautiful gardens.",
