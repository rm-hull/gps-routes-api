  "description": "These two pretty reservoirs sit on the border of Cornwall and Devon. The area is popular with water sports enthusiasts with activities including sailing, windsurfing and kayaking. There's also some nice waterside footpaths for walkers to try. You can park at the Lower Tamar Lake and then head north along the River Tamar to the Upper Lake. Then follow a circular path around the upper lake before returning to the car park. There's nice views across the water to some attractive surrounding countryside as you go. You can also look out for various water loving birds from the on site hide at the lower lake.",

The 89 mile route runs from Cremyll in south Cornwall to Morwenstow on the northern coast.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
