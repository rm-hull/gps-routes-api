  "description": "This large forest in Northern Ireland has miles of footpaths to try. This 2 mile circular walk follows a waymarked trail from the Horseshoe car park at the north western edge of the woods. It's a lovely trail with broadleaved and conifer trees, a series of small ponds and nice views of the Glenmakeeran River. The forest is located just to the south of the coastal town of Ballycastle. You can extend your walk here by following the coastal path with great views towards Rathlin Island and the Mull of Kintyre. The Ulster Way and the Moyle Way long distance paths pass the western side of the forest. You can pick these up to head toward the coast. To continue your woodland walking head south and visit the splendid Glenariff Forest Park. Here you will find a wonderful waterfall walk and miles of other walking trails.",

Near here you could also visit Torr Head. The scenic area is notable as the closest point in Northern Ireland to Scotland, with only 12 miles separating them across the Irish Sea. In Ballycastle you can catch the ferry to the beautiful Rathlin Island. There are some splendid trails here with lots of wildlife to see in the RSPB nature reserve on the island."
