  "description": "These peaceful woods are located a couple of miles east of the small town of Potton in Bedfordshire. There's some nice trails running through the small wood, including the waymarked Clopton Way . You can start the walk from the parking area on Hatley Road, next to the Water Tower. It's located just west of the little village of Cockayne Hatley. From here you can follow the Clopton Way north to enter the woods where there are a few different trails to try. The area is great for flora and fauna with the spring bluebells particularly popular. You can also look out for birds including nightingale, chiffchaff blackcap, whitethroat and European turtle dove.",
