  "description": "This walk visits the River Walkham in the pretty village of Horrabridge in the Dartmoor National Park. The walk starts in the village where you'll find a photogenic packhorse bridge  over the river. From here you head south to pick up the Drakes Trail, a shared walking and cycling trail running through the area. You can then follow the old railway line north west to pick up the riverside trail along the River Walkham. This will take you to the pretty Grenofen Bridge where you can try the popular Grenofen Bridge to Double Waters Walk. This takes you to the point where the River Walkham joins the River Tavy. To continue your walking in the area you could head to the delightful Yelverton Garden House and the historic Buckland Abbey.
