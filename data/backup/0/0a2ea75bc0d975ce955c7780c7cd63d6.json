  "description": "This circular walk takes you around some beautiful countryside on the Gloucestershire/Warwickshire border in the Cotswolds AONB. It's a fairly easy walk, running for about 4 miles on good footpaths marked with yellow and blue arrows. The village of Ebrington is close to Chipping Camden and has pretty thatched Cotswolds cottages and a popular pub dating from the 17th century. There is also Ebrington Manor which dates from the 14th century. The walk starts in the centre of the village and climbs steadily through the countryside to Foxcote House. On the way you'll pass pretty streams, woodland and a lake near to the house. Look out for wildlife including buzzards, pheasants and deer. Ebrington is located just a few miles to the east of Chipping Camden. If you prefer you could start the walk from here and follow the Monarch's Way and the Heart of England Way to the estate. To extend your walk just head a mile or so north of Ebrington and you could visit the splendid Hidcote Manor Garden. There's also our Ilmington Walk which visits the delightful village with its thatched cottages and Norman church.",

      "content": "The Ebrington Arms is one of the finest pubs in the country and well worth a visit after your walk. The award winning pub does excellent food and is set in a wonderful village location with fine views of the surrounding Cotswolds countryside. It's a special place and was recently voted the UK's number 1 village pub by The Times. The inn also has an interesting history, with its charming stone building dating all the way back to the 1640s. Inside there's period pieces including wooden fireplaces and beamed ceilings. You can find it in the village on May Lane at a postcode of GL55 6NH for your sat navs. The pub is also very dog friendly and can provide treats for your pet."

      "content": "The village of Mickleton is located just to the north west of the estate. The Mickleton Walk starts from the village and visits Kiftsgate Gardens, Hidcote Gardens and Chipping Campden. Bretforton and Honeybourne with its timber framed buildings and 13th century thatched pub is also in this area. Less than a mile to the south of Chipping Campden there's the neighbouring village of Broad Campden where you'll find the 18th century pub known as the 'local' of Father Brown, the crime-solving priest who stars in the BBC drama filmed in the Cotswolds.  The circular Upper Quinton Walk also visits Hidcote from the village to the north. The sister village of Lower Quinton includes a noteworthy 16th century pub once owned by Henry VIII. For more walks in the area see the Cotswolds Walks page."
