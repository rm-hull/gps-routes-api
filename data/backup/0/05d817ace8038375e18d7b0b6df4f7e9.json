  "description": "This is a circular walk around a wonderful coastal headland near Padstow with wonderful views along the length of the north Cornwall coast. There's a car park at the north western end of the headland near to the Trevose Head Lighthouse. From here you can pick up the South West Coast Path to take you past the lighthouse and Dinas Head. The path continues around Mother Ivey's Bay to the little village of Harlyn where there is a nice beach at the pretty Harlyn Bay. The bay is a nice place to stop and watch the surfers. From here you can follow country lanes west to Constantine Bay where there's another lovely beach and sand dunes. Head north from here and you will pass Booby's Bay before returning to the car park. Features on the walk include the wild asparagus growing at Dinas Head, interesting rock formations on the cliffs and the secluded bathing beach at Mother Ivey's Bay. Look out for wildlife including fulmar, razorbill and guillemot as you make your way around this beautiful headland. You can extend your walk by continuing east along the coastal path to Stepper Point just north of Padstow. Here you will find the 19th century Daymark Tower and fine views over the Camel Estuary.",

      "content": "Head south along the coast path and you could visit the Bedruthan Steps. The series of large rocks along the beach are a popular tourist attraction and very photogenic. You can also visit the lovely cove and beach at Porthcothan in this area. For a longer circular walk around the headland see the Constantine Bay to Harlyn Bay Walk which starts at the Constantine Bay car park, just south of the lighthouse."
