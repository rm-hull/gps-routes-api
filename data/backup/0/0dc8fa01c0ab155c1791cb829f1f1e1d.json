  "description": "Explore beautiful Nidderdale in the Yorkshire Dales on this circular walk. The walk includes splendid riverside sections along the River Nidd and waterside sections alongside Scar House Reservoir and Gouthwaite Reservoir. The delightful town of Pateley Bridge is a good access point and just a short walk along the River Nidd leads you to one of the main attractions on the route at Gouthwaite Reservoir. Also of interest is the impressive How Stean Gorge and the 15th century Ripley Castle. The castle, and the landscaped grounds are open to the public. Near Pateley Bridge you'll also pass the noteworthy Brimham Rocks. The National Trust owned site includes an extraordinary collection of large rock formations which are hundreds of millions of years old. It's a geoligically fascinating area with good walking trails across the surrounding Brimham Moor to explore. The trail passes just to the south of the site and is well worth a small detour. Just to the east of the rocks there's the more secluded Eavestone Lake to explore as well. The walk is waymarked with named signposts.",
