  "description": "Meandering its way for 109 miles through the Abberley and Malvern Hills Geopark from Bridgnorth to Gloucester, the Geopark Way passes through stunning countryside as it explores 700 million years of geological history. The trail offers varied walking alongside rivers, through forests, along ridges and across valley floors; all with majestic views to match. Passing through an assortment of habitats there is a plethora of wildlife adding to the occasion. Quaint villages and towns dot the route bringing further elements of exploration and enchantment. Highlights on the route includes a stretch through the lovely Eastnor Deer Park next to the 19th century mock castle. The climb through the Malvern Hills is also wonderful with splendid views over the countryside of Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire.",
