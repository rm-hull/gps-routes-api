  "description": "With an excellent local pub and some fine Peak District scenery this little village is a fine place to start a walk. This walk from the village visits the Wincle Brewery, the River Dane, Gradbach, Lud's Church and Three Shires Head. The walk starts from The Ship Inn in Wincle. From here it's a short walk south east to the brewery. The site includes a small shop and tasting room where you can sample some of the 'eccentric' ales brewed here. Near the brewery you cross the river and pick up the Dane Valley Way and follow the waymarked footpath east along the river to Gradbach. The route continues north to visit one of the highlights of the area at Three Shires Head. This is a point on Axe Edge Moor where the counties of Cheshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire meet. Here you will also find a Grade II-listed packhorse bridge over the River Dane. You then retrace your steps to Gradbach where you can explore the wonderful Lud's Church. From here you continue west to Hangingstone Farm before crossing the river at Danebridge and returning to the pub in Wincle.",
