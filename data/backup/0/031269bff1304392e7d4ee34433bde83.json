  "description": "This walk takes you from the village to the nearby beach at Lligwy Bay. It's about a two mile walk from the village to the beach, so 4 miles there and back. The footpath is pretty flat for the whole of the route and follows the waymarked Anglesey Coast Path. The walk starts at Porth Moelfre where there is a small beach and a row of pretty cottages. You head north from here towards Ynys Moelfre, a picturesque little island just of the coast of the village. From here you head west along the path to Lligwy Bay. There's a lovely beach here which is popular with windsurfers and other windpowered watersport enthusiasts. After enjoying the beach the walk return to Moelfre on the same paths.",

      "content": "To continue your walking from Moelfre try the Benllech to Moelfre Walk which heads south from the village. Benllech has an award winning beach with views to the Great Orme and Penmon Point. You can also pick up the Benllech to Red Wharf Bay Walk here and visit the popular bay with its interesting rock formations. Just to the west you'll find the noteworthy Mynydd Bodafon, the highest point on the Island of Anglesey. There are great views over the island from the 178 metre high summit. Head north along the coast and you will come to Amlwch. The coastal town is well worth exploring with a visit to the Copper Kingdom visitor centre in Port Almwch recommended. Here you can learn all about the history of Amlwch's 18th century \u201cCopper Rush\u201d in a series of interesting exhibitions. The splendid Amlwch Walk will take you along the coast to the historic lighthouse and viewpoint at Point Lynas. To the west there's also the beautiful neighbouring village of Bull Bay, the most northerly village in Wales. On the southern edge of the lovely Red Wharf Bay, is the Pentraeth Forest where you can enjoy peaceful woodland trails, climb to Mynydd Llwydiarth and look out for the resident red squirrels. For more walking ideas in the area see the Anglesey Walks page."
