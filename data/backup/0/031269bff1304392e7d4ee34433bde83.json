  "description": "This walk takes you from the village to the nearby beach at Lligwy Bay. It's about a two mile walk from the village to the beach, so 4 miles there and back. The footpath is pretty flat for the whole of the route and follows the waymarked Anglesey Coast Path. The walk starts at Porth Moelfre where there is a small beach and a row of pretty cottages. You head north from here towards Ynys Moelfre, a picturesque little island just of the coast of the village. From here you head west along the path to Lligwy Bay. There's a lovely beach here which is popular with windsurfers and other windpowered watersport enthusiasts. After enjoying the beach the walk return to Moelfre on the same paths.",
