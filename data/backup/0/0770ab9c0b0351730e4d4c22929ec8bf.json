It was a timber- built structure which had been the original Yarmouth Beach station. This station was replaced by an Eastern & Midlands Railway pavilion type structure in brick two years later which was destroyed by fire in 1926 and replaced in concrete. In 2000 the station building at Stalham became available, was dismantled and transported to Holt. The new station was opened in time for the 2005 season."

Fish Hill links Market Place with Bull Street and was once the site of the fish market, which was destroyed by the fire in 1708.  The town survived the Plague of 1348, and by 1556 a school had been opened. The school (a public school since 1900) was founded by Sir John Gresham, and is described as one of the leading schools in the country. In 1708 the town was badly damaged by a fire, which destroyed most of the houses and left the church in the isolated position it occupies today. In Victorian times, Holt had a population of around 1700 and a daily coach service to Cromer, Norwich and London; the railway arrived in 1884."

  "description": "Explore nearly 100 acres of peaceful woodland in this country park in Norfolk. The park is situated around the River Glaven and contains several delightful trails through the woods including Scots Pine, Oak and Silver Birch. The park includes a Visitors Centre, a waymarked arts trail and a cycle route. The area is great for wildlife so keep your eyes peeled for grazing ponies, various woodland birds and butterflies fluttering around the park's wildflowers. After exploring the park you could head into the attractive Georgian town of Holt which is well worth exploring. The Holt-Mannington Walk starts in the park. The circular waymarked footpath will take you south east to Mannington Hall and Gardens near Itteringham. The historic house is surrounded by lovely parkland with delightful gardens, woodland and a lake to see.",
