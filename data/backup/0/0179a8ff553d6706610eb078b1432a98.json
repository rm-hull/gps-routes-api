  "description": "Fletcher Moss is a beautiful botanical garden located in Didsbury, Manchester. The gardens contain a wide range of ornamental trees and shrubs, including Chusan palms, tulip trees, mulberry, dawn redwood and various dwarf conifers. There are also pretty rock gardens, little waterfalls and ponds. The gardens attract a wide variety of birdlife so you can sit enjoy the birdsong for a while. A short walk from Fletcher Moss takes you to the adjacent Parsonage gardens where you will find several large yew trees and pretty flower beds. The Trans Pennine Trail runs past the park so you could pick this up and enjoy a walk along the River Mersey. Stenner Woods nature reserve is also right next to the park so this is another good option if you'd like to extend your walk.",
