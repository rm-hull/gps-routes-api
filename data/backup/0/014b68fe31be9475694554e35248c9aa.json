  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk along this disused railway line in the Bradford area. The trail follows the route of the old\u00a0Great Northern\u00a0railway line between\u00a0Bradford and Keighley. The lines were closed in 1972 but have been converted into a pleasant leisure route for walkers and cyclists. The route runs for a distance of just under 6 miles on a reasonably flat path passing a series of interesting old viaducts. The route starts at Queensbury where you can pick up the trail and head north towards Thornton Viaduct . The structure is\u00a0300 yards (270\u00a0m) long and has 20 arches. From the top of the viaduct there are fine views to enjoy. The trail then bends round to the north west, passing Close Head Row before coming to Doe Park Reservoir. The path continues north to Hewenden Reservoir and Viaduct . The viaduct crosses the Hewenden Beck valley and provides nice views down to the reservoir of the same name. After descending the viaduct the trail arrives in Cullingworth where the route finishes at Cullingworth Viaduct.",
