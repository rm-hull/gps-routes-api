  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk along this disused railway line in the Bradford area. The trail follows the route of the old Great Northern railway line between Bradford and Keighley. The lines were closed in 1972 but have been converted into a pleasant leisure route for walkers and cyclists. The route runs for a distance of just under 6 miles on a reasonably flat path passing a series of interesting old viaducts. The route starts at Queensbury where you can pick up the trail and head north towards Thornton Viaduct. The structure is 300 yards (270 m) long and has 20 arches. From the top of the viaduct there are fine views to enjoy. The trail then bends round to the north west, passing Close Head Row before coming to Doe Park Reservoir. The path continues north to Hewenden Reservoir and Viaduct. The viaduct crosses the Hewenden Beck valley and provides nice views down to the reservoir of the same name. After descending the viaduct the trail arrives in Cullingworth where the route finishes at Cullingworth Viaduct.",

It's a bit of a hidden gem with great food and a cosy log burner for colder days. You can find it at 381 Thornton Rd with a postcode of BD13 3JX for your sat navs. Near the end of the route you could head a little west and visit The Dog and Gun at Denholme. This 17th Century coaching inn has a fine dining room with spectacular views of the surrounding area. The interior is full or character with oak beams and two open fires for chilly days. You can find the pub on the Denholme Road at a postcode of BD22 9SN for your sat navs."
