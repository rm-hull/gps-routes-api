  "description": "Visit this pretty reservoir in the Peak District and enjoy great views over Saddleworth Moor on this walk near Mossley. You can start your walk from the Dovestone Reservoir car park and follow the Oldham Way over the Chew Hills to reach the reservoir. It's about a 3 mile walk to the reservoir, passing along Dovestone Reservoir and its adjacent woodland before the climb to Chew Reservoir. It's quite a big climb with the reservoir located in an elevated position some 1,600 feet (488 m) above sea level. From the high points there are fine views over the surrounding moorland and hills. The paths are generally good with part of the walk following the surfaced Chew Road and the pretty Chew Brook. When you reach the reservoir you can follow a footpath along the southern side of the water. To extend your walk you could continue towards Laddow Moss where you can pick up the Pennine Way and follow it to the nearby Torside Reservoir .",
