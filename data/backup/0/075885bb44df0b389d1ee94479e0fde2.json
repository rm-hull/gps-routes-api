  "description": "Explore the extensive landscaped parkland surrounding this mid 18th century\u00a0Neo-Palladian\u00a0mansion near Pershore . There are miles of walking paths taking you around the pretty lake with statues, bridges, follies and classical temples located around the lakeside.\u00a0You then head into the 'Capability' Brown designed landscape following the serpentine Croome River which flows through the centre of the park. Other highlights include the lovely Church of St Mary Magdalene, the Icehouse, the Shrubbery, Walled gardens, a Dipping Pond and the Rotunda. The River Severn runs just to the west of the park. It's a great place to extend your walking on the Severn Way long distance walking trail. Following it north will take you through Kempsey to Worcester. Head south to visit Upton Upon Severn and Tewkesbury .",
