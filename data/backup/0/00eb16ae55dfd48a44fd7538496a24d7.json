  "description": "The village of Sticklepath is located in a lovely spot on the River Taw in the north eastern section of Dartmoor National Park. There's fine riverside trails, woodland paths and a splendid climb to a prominent local hill. This circular walk from the village visits two local viewpoints in the shape of Ramsley Hill and Cosdon Hill. You'll also visit the neighbouring village of South Zeal and the stone circle at Little Hound Tor. There's fantastic views and you should see some Dartmoor ponies on the way too. The walk starts from the public car park in the village, next to the River Taw. From here you can pick up the Dartmoor Way and follow the waymarked trail south east through South Zeal. The route then turns south to climb up to the viewpoint at Ramsley Hill. You continue south to Cheriton Combe before climbing up to the stone circle at Little Hound Tor. Here you turn north to cross South Tawton Common before coming to the summit point at Cosdon Hill. The hill is also known as Cawsden Beacon and rises to a height of 550 metres (1,800\u00a0ft). As such it is one of the highest hills on Dartmoor. From this elevated spot there are excellent views over Dartmoor to the coast at Teignmouth and Start Point . From the hill top you descend north to arrive back in Sticklepath.",
