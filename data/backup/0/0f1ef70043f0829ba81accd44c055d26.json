  "description": "Enjoy a short easy walk around the pretty Hatch Mere on this walk in Delamere Forest. The mere is also a nature reserve run by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. Here you can look out for a variety of interesting birds including great crested grebe, reed bunting and willow warbler. The reserve also includes the surrounding fens, wet woodland and wet heath with many rare plants to see as well. You can find the site at a postcode of WA6 6NY with the reserve accessed via a footpath off Ashton Road in the village, just as you enter the forest. There's also some nice woodland trails running past the western side of the lake and a pub for refreshments on the eastern side.",
