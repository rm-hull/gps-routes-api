Historically, Honeybourne was made up of two villages:\u00a0Church Honeybourne\u00a0was in Worcestershire while\u00a0Cow Honeybourne\u00a0was in\u00a0Gloucestershire. Their names are derived from\u00a0Old English\u00a0hunig, \"honey\", and\u00a0burna, \"stream\", the whole meaning \"(places on) the stream by which honey is found\". Boundary changes in 1931 moved Cow Honeybourne into Worcestershire and the two parishes were united in 1958."
