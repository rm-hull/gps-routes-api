  "description": "This large woodland area near Hursley has miles of walking trails to try. You can reach the woods by following the Monarch's Way west from the village. In the woods you can see bluebells in the spring and look out for wildlife including deer and various woodland birds. The woods are located close to the town of Romsey where you can enjoy a stroll along the Andover Canal on the Romsey Canal Walk. You could also continue west along the Monarch's Way and head through the countryside to Michelmersh and visit the splendid Mottisfont Abbey. The 13th century Augustinian priory is surrounded by glorious grounds and is a major highlight of the area.",
