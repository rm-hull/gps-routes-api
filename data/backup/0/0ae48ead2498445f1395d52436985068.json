  "description": "Follow the Basingstoke canal from Up Nately to Woodham, on this delightful waterside walk. The walk passes Fleet, Woking, Farnborough and Aldershot. There's lots of pretty locks and regular views of the lovely Hampshire and Surrey countryside. The walk starts from Up Nately, located just to the east of the town of Basingstoke. You then head east passing the ruins of Odiham Castle which was built by King John in the early part of the 13th century. The route continues past North Warnborough to Dogmersfield Park. The canal runs through the park which also has some nice woodland trails and a pretty lake. You continue east past Crookham Village before heading through the large town of Fleet. The route then passes through the woodland of the Forest of Eversley to Aldershot. Here you head through the lovely Lakeside Nature Reserve where there are a series of lakes and lots of wildlife to look out for. At Aldershot the canal turns north toward Frimley Lodge Park where you turn east to Woking. Shortly after the route comes to an end at Woodham, on the outskirts of Weybridge. Here the canal joins with the River Wey Navigation which you could follow north to Weybridge and the River Thames.",
