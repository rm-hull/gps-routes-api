  "description": "This lovely Kent based town has nice trails to follow along Faversham Creek and the Swale Estuary. The surrounding marshland also has a number of nature reserves where you can look out for a large variety of wildlife. Two long distance trails pass through the town. The Swale Heritage Trail and Saxon Shore Way are both great options for exploring the surrounding area on foot. This circular walk makes use of both trails to take you through the town and around Ham Marshes. The route passes along the pretty Oare and Faversham Creeks with lovely countryside views on the way. After the walk enjoy a stroll around the town with its attractive market square and Fleur-de-Lis centre, which provides tourist information and houses a museum. There's also the Grade I listed Faversham Parish Church which was established in 1147 by\u00a0King Stephen\u00a0and dissolved by\u00a0Henry VIII. To continue your walking in the Faversham area, head east to the splendid Blean Woods National Nature Reserve . The site is one of the most extensive areas of broadleaf woodland in Britain and home to a wide variety of wildlife. You can also try the popular Faversham to Whitstable Walk which takes you along the estuary on the epic Saxon Shore Way long distance trail.",
