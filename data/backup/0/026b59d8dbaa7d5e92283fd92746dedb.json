  "description": "This pretty Welsh village is located in a lovely spot on the south side of the Llyn Peninsula. There's a fine National Trust owned beach with wildlife such as oyster catchers and curlew to look out for at low tide. It's a great place for coastal walking with a wide area of beach, a large headland area, woodland and heathland to explore. This walk takes you along a section of the Wales Coast Path from Llanbedrog to neighbouring Pwllheli. The walk runs for just over 4 miles along the attractive beach. Along the way you'll pass sand dunes and the Pwllheli Golf Course towards the end of the route. To continue your walking from Llanbedrog you could head south along the coast path to visit Abersoch. On the way you will pass Mynydd Tir y Cwmwd (Llanbedrog headland) where there are more great views to enjoy.",

The unusual landscape at the Trefor Quarry can also be visited near here. A few miles to the north west there's the inland climb to the remote Garn Fadryn. There's an Iron Age Hillfort and some incredible views from the top of this peaceful hill. The Garn Boduan Walk starts from nearby Nefyn. It will take you up to the viewpoint and Iron Age Hill fort located just south of the settlement. For more walking ideas in the area see the Llyn Peninsula Walks page."
