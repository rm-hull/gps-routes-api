  "description": "This walk takes you along the old St Fillans and Comrie Railway from St Fillans to Dalchonzie and Comrie. Along the way you'll pass the old stations and viaducts with views of the River Earn and the surrounding hills to enjoy as well. You start off in the little village of St Fillans on the eastern shores of Loch Earn . Here you can still see the well preserved old St Filans station buildings which closed in 1951. The route then follows the dismantled railway line south east, passing St Fillans Hill and crossing the River Earn as you approach Dalchonzie. Here the walk picks up a quiet country lane taking you past Dalchonzie House and then into Comrie. To extend the walk head north to visit the splendid Deil's Cauldron . Here you'll find a cascading waterfall and several pools resembling a boiling cauldron. To continue your walking in the area try the Loch Earn Walk which takes you to a fine viewpoint above the loch. You could also pick up the Lochearnhead to St Fillans Railway Walk which will take you west along another section of the railway to Lochearnhead.",
