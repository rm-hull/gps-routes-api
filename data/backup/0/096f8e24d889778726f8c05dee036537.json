  "description": "This Cumbrian town includes a historic castle, waterside trails along the Swindale Beck and some lovely Eden countryside scenery. This circular walk starts at the ruined castle in the town. The Castle dates back to the 11th century and is now in the care of English Heritage. Nearby there's the Norman St Michael's church where you can learn all about the history of the site. After exploring the grounds you can then follow bridle tracks west past the Verteris Roman Fort towards Great Musgrave. Here you cross the Swindale Beck and follow the Musgrave Lane back east towards the village.",
