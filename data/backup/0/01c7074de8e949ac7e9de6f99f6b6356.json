  "description": "This inland village on the Isle of Anglesey includes the historic Llynon Mill and some pleasant walking trails. The mill dates back to 1775 and is notable as the only working windmill in Wales, producing stoneground wholemeal flour using organic wheat. There's also some photogenic roundhouses which provide a fascinating insight into the life of Iron Age farmers, thousands of years ago. The site includes the Llynon Walking Trail which runs for about 2 miles, taking you to some of the key features. This circular walk starts at the mill and takes you through the surrounding countryside on a mixture of country lanes and public footpaths. The Copper Trail also starts at the mill. The long distance cycle route visits some of the island's highlights including Parys Mountain. Much of it is on quiet country lanes so is also suitable for walkers. Another good local walking option is Llyn Alaw. The expansive lake lies just to the east of the village and has some pleasant waterside paths to try.",

There's much to see here including the fascinating Swtan Heritage Museum where you can journey into the past in a fine old thatched cottage. There's also an excellent cliff top path and a delightful sandy beach with rock pools and rocky outcrops."
