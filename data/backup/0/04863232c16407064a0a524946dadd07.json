  "description": "This large Leicestershire based village has some nice canal and country trails to try. This circular walk from the village visits the canalised section of the River Soar before heading through the countryside to visit the neighbouring village of West Leake. The walk starts from the public car park next to the canal locks on the eastern side of the village. It's a lovely spot for a stroll with a marina, a Grade II listed bridge and lots of boats to see going through the locks. After exploring the canal you can pick up a section of the Midshires Way and follow the waymarked footpath east along Melton Lane to West Leake. The route then heads west through Sutton Bonnington to return to the river. Here you'll pass the historic Sutton Bonington Hall, a\u00a0country house\u00a0erected in the\u00a0Queen Anne\u00a0period and known locally as \"The Hall\".  After passing the village you can then follow a riverside footpath north to return to the car park.",
