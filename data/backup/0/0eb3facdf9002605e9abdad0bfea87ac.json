Majestic specimen trees such as Californian sequoia, Bhutan pine, Wellingtonia (Giant sequoia), yew, and Monterey cypress grace the area near the main car park and forest road. Along the main access road, a dense canopy of exotic rhododendrons bursts into bloom during early summer, offering a spectacle worth witnessing. Many of these trees and plants were brought back by members of the Shanbally Estate following their overseas travels during the era of the grand house."

Two footbridges allow walkers to access both sides of the wood with ease. A highly recommended excursion is a stroll to the northern end of Glengarra, where Viscount Lismore erected a lodge known as the Mountain Lodge during the nineteenth century. This magnificent hunting and fishing lodge occupies a stunning location and is currently undergoing restoration efforts by the local Burncourt community."

  "description": "This circular loop walk explores Glengarra Woods in the Galty Mountains. There are two waymarked walking trails in the expansive woods. The Loop Walk (2 kms, 1 hour, easy) is a great introduction to Glengarra for all ages, taking in some of the magnificent specimen trees around the car park, crossing the Burncourt river and into a beautiful stand of Scot\u2019s Pine, our native conifer species. The longer Millennium Trail (7 kms, 2.5 hours, moderate) is particularly beautiful and has many interesting features, including old forest tracks, an enclosed exotic rhododendron canopy, the Mountain Lodge, Galty views and the Burncourt River. To continue your walking in the area head north to Lake Muskry where there are some great views of Galtymore Mountain.",
