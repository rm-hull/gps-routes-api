  "description": "Explore the Brendon Hills range on this challenging walk in the Exmoor National Park. The hills are a less well known area of the county so provide an opportunity for a quieter walk in idyllic surroundings. The attractive landscape consists of streams, rivers, rolling hills and wooded valleys. The walk starts from the village of Wheddon Cross near Cuttcombe. You then pick up the Coleridge Way and climb to Lype Hill, the highest point in the range at 1,388 feet (423 m). From here you can enjoy lovely views over the attractive Somerset and Exmoor countryside. The route then passes Lype Common and Colly Hill before descending to the village of Luxborough where you can enjoy refreshments. To continue your walking in the area you can climb the nearby Dunkery Beacon or pick up the Samaritans Way South West.  There are also good woodland walking trails if you head north to Croydon Hill Iron Age hill fort from Churchtown. If you continue east along the Coleridge Way you will come to Combe Sydenham Country Park. Here you will find 500 acres of woodland, parkland and gardens surrounding a Grade I listed 15th century manor house.",
