  "description": "This walk explore the Ragley Hall estate in Arrow, Warwickshire. The park is open to the public on certain days of the year with more details on the link below. The site includes a fine 17th century stately home surrounded by beautiful parkland and gardens. Highlights include a seasonal rose garden, an attractive woodland avenue, a lake and a Secret Garden. From the paths there are also lovely views of the surrounding countryside. In Ferburary there's the popular Snowdrop walks where you can explore the 26 acres of formal gardens and see the multitude of snowdrop varieties. The hall is located just to the south west of the Roman town of Alcester where you can continue your walking along the River Arrow. The Tudor Coughton Court is also nearby and another historic highlight of the area.",
