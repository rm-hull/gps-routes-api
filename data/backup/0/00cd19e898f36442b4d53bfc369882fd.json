  "description": "This hill in West Sussex has a set of distinctive radio masts on the summit. You can park at a small parking area to the west of the hill and follow the South Downs Way past Beeding Hill to the top of Truleigh Hill. There's great views of the surrounding hills and countryside from the high points. You can turn it into a circular walk by following tracks across Bushy Bottom and then the Monarch's Way back to the car park. You could also start the walk from nearby Upper Beeding or Bramley Castle if you prefer. To extend your walk you can continue east along the South Downs Way to Edbarton Hill and then on to Devils Dyke. The beautiful V-Shaped Valley is a great place for walking and mountain biking. You can use the google street view link below to follow this part of the trail.",

Following the South Downs Way west from the village will take you along the Fulking Escarpment to the hill. The Shepherd and Dog pub in the village has a car park making it a good alternative start point. See the Fulking Circular Walk for more details. To continue your walking in the area see the South Downs Walks page."
