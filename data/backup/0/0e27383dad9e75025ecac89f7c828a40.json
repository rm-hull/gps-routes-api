  "description": "A long circular walk around the beautiful Llyn Brenig, in the heart of the Denbigh Moors. There's nice woodland trails, views of the River Brenig and great views across the water to the surrounding hills. The northern end of the lake is also a nature reserve so there's lots of wildlife to see too. Look out for deer, otters, red squirrels, badgers, grouse and buzzards. The walk also includes lovely views of heather moorland and a stretch along the impressive dam towards the end. You can start the walk from the car park and visitor centre at the south western end of the lake. You can easily pick up the trails from here. After your exercise you can enjoy refreshments in the lakeside cafe. To continue your reservoir walking in the area, head west and visit Alwen Reservoir. The Brenig Way also starts at the lake. The long distance trail can be followed through the Dee Valley to Carrog and Corwen .< The Clwydian Way also passes along the western side of the lake. It will take you through the Clwydian Range of mountains with splendid views of north Wales, Snowdonia, the Cheshire Plain and the Peak District. The reservoir sits on the western edge of the expansive Clocaenog Forest. There's miles of cycling and walking trails to be found here.",
