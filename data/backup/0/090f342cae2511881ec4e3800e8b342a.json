It is a Grade II* listed stone structure in the Transitional style (from Early English to Decorated), is primarily from the Norman era. The church consists of a chancel with a south vestry, a clerestoried nave with four bays, aisles, and a south porch, as well as an embattled western tower that, until 1967, housed a clock and four bells. The main south doorway, which dates to around 1195 and features some fine Norman work, is the oldest part of the church. An aisleless church from the 12th century had this as its south entrance. On the south side, there is a smaller door from the same era as well. A south aisle was first added to this early structure. The nave was then expanded eastward at the beginning of the 14th century. The west tower collapsed in 1967 and was not rebuilt"
