  "description": "This delightful village is located in a fine position in the Vale of Ffestiniog in Snowdonia. There's views of the River Dwyryd, beautiful local gardens, several nearby reservoirs and expansive woodland to the north of the settlement. This walk visits the lovely Plas Tan y Bwlch Gardens before heading to the picturesque Llyn Mair. The walk starts from the car park at Plas Tan y Bwlch which is the Snowdonia National Park environmental studies centre. There are some delightful gardens here with woodland, ornamental shrubs, streams, little waterfalls and views over the River Dwyryd to Maentwrog. During the Spring and early Summer, species of Rhododendron and Azalea are a splendid colourful sight in the gardens. From the gardens you can then follow a footpath north to visit the nearby Llyn Mair. There's a pretty weir here and some nice trails through the surrounding woodland.",
