  "description": "This circular walk around Grewelthorpe uses the Ripon Rowel long distance trail to visit Hackfall Woods and the River Ure. The route runs for a distance of about 4 miles using a mixture of public footpaths and country lanes. You start the walk in the village and follow footpaths north east towards the river and the woods. Here you pick up the waymarked Ripon Rowel and follow it west into Hackfall Woods. The woods are a popular place with  grottos, old temples, follies, waterfalls and riverside paths along the River Ure. You'll then climb to Limehouse Hill where there are splendid views of Masham Church, The Ruin and Mowbray Castle which was famously painted by Turner. After descending the hill the route follows more woodland paths back into Grewelthorpe.",
