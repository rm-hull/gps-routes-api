  "description": "This walk climbs to Arthur's Pike And Bonscale Pike above Ullswater Lake in the Lake District. They are both excellent lakeland viewpoints with the photogenic Bonscale Tower a highlight of the walk. You can start the walk from the Howtown Hotel just to the west of the hills. You could also start from the roadside parking at Howtown pier. From here follow trails north east to Swarth Fell and Bonscale Pike. At the top of the 524 m (1,719 ft) hill there are two particularly fine beacons including the photogenic Bonscale Tower. There's great views towards Hallin Fell from here too. The fell lies just to the west and can also be climbed from Howton. There are fine views over the Martindale Valley from here. From Bonscale you continue north east, crossing the Swarth Beck before coming to the Arthur's Pike summit which stands at 533 m (1,749 ft). There are excellent views back down to the lake and across to the surrounding fells from here. To continue your walking in the area you can pick up the Howtown to Glenridding Walk or the Pooley Bridge to Howtown Walk. These popular trails run close to the lake with fine views across the water.",
