Here you'll find a series of nice woodland trails, small lakes, monuments, follies, a small chapel and several thousand rare trees. You can access the site at South Farm Lane where you can pick up a series of public footpaths around the woods and the ponds. Head a short distance west of the site and you can visit Lightwater Country Park . There's more nice trails here with 145 acres of heathland habitat, woodland and hill climbs with views towards the city of London.",
