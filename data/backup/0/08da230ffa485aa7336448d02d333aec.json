This group is also known as one of the Seven Wonders of the Waterways. The third and final group consists of six locks taking the flight into Devizes"

  "description": "This circular walk visits this wonderful feat of engineering on the Kennet and Avon Canal in Devizes, Wiltshire. The 29 continuos locks have a rise of 237 feet in 2 miles (72 m in 3.2 km). It's a stunning sight with the bonus of some lovely woodland and countryside to see in the area surrounding the locks. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for with Kingfishers, Moorhens, Ducks and Swans to see on the water. You can start the walk from the Caen Hill Locks car park. Then follow the footpaths along the locks before crossing to the other side of the canal and picking up the towpath. You can continue east along the canal into Devizes and visit the Canal centre. The town is also well worth exploring with fine Elizabethan timber-framed houses in St John's Alley, two Norman Churches, the 16th-century Bear Hotel and the attractive market place among the highlights. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the Caen Hill canalside cafe. There's also a small canal museum where you can learn all about the history of the canal locks. In the town you can pick up the long distance Wessex Ridgeway and follow it north along Quaker's Walk to Roundway Hill. The hill is the site of a famous Civil War battle where a Royalist cavalry force under Lord Wilmot won a crushing victory over the Parliamentarians in 1643. It's a great place to extend your walk and enjoy lovely views over the surrounding countryside. Other walks around Devizes include the White Horse Trail and the Mid-Wilts Way which both run through the town. The White Horse Trail visits several of Wiltshire's well known hill figures with some lovely countryside to enjoy on the way. You can virtually explore the locks by clicking on the google street view link below!",
