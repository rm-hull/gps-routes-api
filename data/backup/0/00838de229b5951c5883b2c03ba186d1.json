This is a packhorse bridge, built to link the Shugborough estate to the village of Great Haywood. And if you search on the Web for information and photos of it, you'll be in for another surprise: it used to be over twice as long. By the way, it crosses the Trent just below the point where that river meets the River Sow."

  "description": "This circular walk uses public footpaths and the Staffordshire Way to take you around Shugborough Park in Great Haywood. You also have the option of exploring the 900 acre Shugborough Estate with its mansion house and delightful gardens. This does require and entry fee though. The walk starts from the car park at Milford, passing Milford Common and heading to Shugborough Hall. You return with a lovely waterside section along the River Sow. The Trent and Mersey Canal passes along the northern edge of the park so there is scope for continuing your walk through the beautiful Trent Valley along this waterway. You are also right on the edge of the Cannock Chase AONB so you could extend your outing by exploring miles of woodland trails. The Two Saints Way runs right through the area to Lichfield so this is a good way of extending your walk.",
