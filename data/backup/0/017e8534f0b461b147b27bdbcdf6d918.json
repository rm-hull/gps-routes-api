  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this pretty reservoir near Penicuik. The route runs for a distance of about 5 miles, following a series of country lanes and footpaths around the water. The large reservoir was built in the 1870s, and is a public water supply reservoir for Edinburgh. With an area of 168 hectares, it is the largest body of fresh water in the Lothians. Start the walk from the roadside parking at the south western end of the reservoir. From here you can pick up country lanes to take you around the water. Just to the north is Rosebery Reservoir which is another popular fishing spot in the Lammermuir Hills. To continue your walking in the Pentland Hills head north to the Flotterstone visitor centre and try our circular walk around Glencorse Reservoir. Near here there's more nice waterside footpaths around Harlaw Reservoir and Threipmuir Reservoir .",
