  "description": "This walk takes you around Rudding Park to the photogenic Crimple Valley Viaduct on the outskirts of Harrogate. The walk starts in the little village of Follifoot where you can pick up a footpath heading north around the edge of Rudding Park. The park includes a Grade I listed Regency-style country house, a spa and an 18-hole golf course in the 18th-century parkland. You can stay at the hotel and enjoy a popular spa day here. Near the park you can link up with the Harrogate Ringway and follow the waymarked trail west through the Crimple Valley to the viaduct. It's a pretty area with woodland and weirs on the Crimple Beck leading you to the impressive railway structure.",
