This had been constructed by railway magnate Dean Berkeley Wise, attracting people to take the train from Belfast to Whitehead, opening in 1902. The path remained a hit with tourists until the outbreak of the Second World War forced its closure. It reopened for a time after the war but closed again in 1962. From 2011-2015 Larne Borough Council led a project to reopen The Gobbins. A series of new bridges and galleries were constructed and installed during 2014\u201315. From 2011-2015 Larne Borough Council led a project to reopen The Gobbins. The path was then accessible to visitors from August 2015 by guided tour and re-opened fully on 30 June 2017."

  "description": "The Gobbins Cliff Path is considered one of the most dramatic coastal walks in Europe. The path is located on the rugged coastline at Islandmagee, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It's a photogenic place with wonderful geological rock formations and lots of sea birds to look out for on the path. Keep your eyes peeled for Guillemots and Kittiwakes as you make your way along the path. On the path there's a series of bridges and a 22-metre-long (72 ft) tunnel, including a section which runs below sea-level. There's also a viewing platform with excellent views over Belfast Lough.",

The path was the precursor to the Gobbin's Path and sits in a fine spot at the northern end of Belfast Lough where it opens out into the North Channel that separates Northern Ireland and Scotland. Head towards Belfast and you can continue your walking in Redburn Country Park where there are fine views to Belfast Lough, Belfast Harbour, George Best City Airport, Belfast Castle and Cave Hill Country Park. To the north west you can enjoy a climb to the popular Slemish Mountain. There's excellent views over the area from the summit of this viewpoint near Broughshane. To the south west there's the Woodburn Forest near Carrickfergus. Here you'll find miles of good woodland trails and a number of attractive reservoirs. Also nearby is the Glenoe Waterfall. The picturesque falls are located in the pretty village of Glenoe in County Antrim. It's a fine place for a walk with pleasant trails taking you through peaceful woodland to the 30ft high waterfall. For more walking ideas in the area see the Belfast Walks page."
