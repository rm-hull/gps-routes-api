  "description": "Explore this peaceful wooded cove and enjoy waterfalls, woodland trails and splendid views of the Bristol Channel. Woody Bay is located on the coast of the Exmoor National Park. The Hanging Water stream runs through the woodland with lovely waterfalls and interesting flora and fauna to enjoy. This walk starts at the car park on Sir Robert's Path and takes you through the woodland to the pretty little bay with its secluded pebble beach. If you would like to extend your walking in the area then you could head west along the coast to the lovely Heddon Valley. Here you will find riverside walking trails and the imposing cliffs of Heddon's Mouth. You could also start the walk from here as shown in the video below. If you head east then you will come to the spectacular Valley of the Rocks where there are a number of interesting geological features to see.",
