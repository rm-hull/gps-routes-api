  "description": "The South Bucks Way runs from Coombe Hill near Wendover to Denham near Uxbridge for a distance of approximately 23 miles. You begin at the top of Coombe Hill with splendid views of the surrounding countryside and descend towards Great Missenden where you will pass the Abbey and join the River Misbourne. The route then follows the river through Little Missenden and the pretty Shardeloes Park where there are some picturesque lakes and a fine old mansion house. You then pass through Amersham , Chalfont St Giles and Chalfont St Peter before joining the River Colne for the final stretch into Denham, where you finish by the Grand Union Canal .",
