  "description": "This fine Georgian country house is located in Cheshire, near Kidsgrove and Sandbach. The house is the seat of the Wilbraham family, members of the landed gentry in the parish of Odd Rode. It's Grade II listed as are the grotto, ice house, and ornamental obelisk in the park. Rode Hall is surrounded by lovely woodland, parkland and gardens with a popular snowdrop walk to do in February. It's a beautiful walk with carpets of over 70 types of snowdrops covering the area. In spring the herbaceous border comes to life, rhododendrons bloom and the bluebells come out too. The park also features a lovely one mile long lake, a kitchen garden, a rose garden and a heronry. The house also hosts a popular Farmers Market where you can buy a variety of local produce. See the link below for more details.",

Plants and seasonal garden produce may also be purchased here. If you fancy a pub lunch then you could head to the nearby Wilbraham Arms in Alsager. The pub takes its name from the prominent local family that owned the nearby Rode Hall. It is positioned on the site of a former Cheshire farmhouse and includes extensive grounds, with two separate drinks terraces as well as a lawn seating area. It's a lovely place to relax in the summer months and can be found near the hall at a postcode of ST7 2AX."

      "content": "You can reach the hall from the nearby market town of Sandbach on the Sandbach Walk. This follows the Trent and Mersey Canal all the way to the hall. You could also head east to visit Mow Cop which has strong connections to the hall. Here you'll find Mow Cop Castle, an 18th century folly regarded as one of the landmarks of the area. The folly was built in 1754 by Randle Wilbraham of Rode Hall as a summerhouse and last restored in 2003. From the elevated position of the castle there are splendid views over the canal and the surrounding countryside. Just to the west of the hall you can pick up the Salt Line. This easy path will take you from Hassall Green to Alsager, passing the Borrow Pit Meadows nature reserve on the way. The Alsager Walk uses the trail and the canal to create a circular route which visits the hall on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
