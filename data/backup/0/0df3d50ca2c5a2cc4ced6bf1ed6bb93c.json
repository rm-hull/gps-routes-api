  "description": "This walk visits Dewsbury Country Park in the market town of Dewsbury, Kirklees. You can find the park to the west of the town centre on the former Lower Spen Valley Landfill site between Ravensthorpe, Dewsbury Moor and Heckmondwike. There's miles of footpaths with orchards, wildflower meadows, ponds and lots of wildlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of birds and butterflies around the wildflowers in the summer months. You can start your walk from the car park and then pick up a trail along the Spen Beck before crossing the waterway and exploring the other part of the park. The Spen Valley Greenway runs through the park providing an opportunity to extend your walk. The shared cycling and walking route runs along a disused railway line from Dewsbury to Oakenshaw near Bradford. If you head east you could visit Crow's Nest Park where there's an ornamental lake and a  a walled wildflower garden to see. On the eastern side of the town you could also pick up the Kirklees Way. The long distance, waymarked trail explores the Kirklees district visiting the Colne Valley, Spen Valley and Holme Valley. On the southern side of the town you can pick up the Calder and Hebble Navigation Canal at the Dewsbury Canal Basin.",
