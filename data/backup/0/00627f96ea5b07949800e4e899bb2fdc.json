    "description": "This walk takes you on a tour of the best parks, woodland and rivers in around the city centre of Belfast. The walk starts on the River Lagan and follows the Lagan Towpath south to Ormeau Park. The park is the oldest municipal park in Belfast, having been originally opened in 1871. There's nice tree-lined paths and pretty gardens to admire in this popular park. After strolling around Ormeau Park you continue south along the river to the Belfast Botanical Gardens. The 19th century public park contains a wonderful Palm House conservatory with a cool wing and a tropical wing. There's also the Tropical Ravine House, rose garden and a fine statue of Belfast born Physicist Lord Kelvin. The towpath continues south to Belvoir Park Forest. The woods have a number of waymarked trails to try with lots of woodland wildlife to look out for. The park is somewhat unusual as it is rare to find a working forest within a city. The path continues through Lagan Meadows and Clement Wilson Park before coming to the splendid Lagan Valley Regional Park. Here you will find wet meadows, ponds, mixed beech woodland and attractive parkland set next to the river. The route continues along the river, passing Newforge cricket ground and the village of Edenderry before coming to Lady Dixon Park. The expansive 128 acre park park consists of meadows, woodland and gardens with a number of well laid out footpaths to follow. Other features in the park include the 19th century Wilmont House, arboretum, the Azalea Walk, fountains, a walled garden and a delightful a Japanese-style garden with pretty water features. To further extend your walk you can continue along the Lagan Towpath to Lisburn. There are lots of other nice walks to try in and around Belfast. You could visit Belfast Castle, Cave Hill Country Park and Redburn Country Park where you can enjoy great views over the city and Belfast Harbour. There's also the excellent Comber Greenway walking and cycle route. The route runs along a disused railway line between Belfast and Comber with great views of Stormont and Scrabo Tower .",
