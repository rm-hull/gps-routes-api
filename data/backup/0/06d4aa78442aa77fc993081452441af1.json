  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the viewpoint at Askham Fell from the Lake District village of Askham. The fell is situated on the eastern side of the National Park, close to the popular town of Penrith . From the summit there are excellent views to the surrounding fells and down to the nearby Ullswater Lake . The walk starts in the village and heads west along Askham Beck to Don Bottom, Haber Hill and Ringingleys Top before coming to Heughscar Hill. There's a boundary stone here and fine views to enjoy. The route then heads south east across Askham Fell and Moor Divock before descending to a country lane. Follow this lane east and it will take you to Helton and the River Lowther where you turn north along a riverside path. You'll pass Gillrigs and Keldron Spring before returning to the village.",
