  "description": "This circular coastal walk near Newton Ferrers visits Gara Point with wonderful views over the Yealm Estuary. The walk starts from the National Trust car park at Warren and follows the South West Coast Path to Gara Point, passing Blackstone Point SSI on the way. It's a lovely spot with wildflowers, green fields, gorse and wonderful views to Wembury Bay, Plymouth Sound and the Mewstone. From Gara Point you head towards Cellar Beach which you can visit by climbing down some steps. You then start a short woodland section through the Brakehill Plantation, a 19th-century woodland of ash, chestnut, sycamore, beech and oaks. You continue through more woodland towards Noss Mayo with great views over the Yealm River and Newton Ferrers. The final section heads inland through the countryside on a mixture of country lanes and footpaths, returning you to the car park. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Wembury Point .",
