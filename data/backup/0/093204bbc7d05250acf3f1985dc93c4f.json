  "description": "With a beautiful coastline, some fine city parks, local forests and riverside trails the city of Aberdeen is a great place for walkers. This walk takes you around Duthie Park, near the River Dee, in the city. The popular park includes restored Victorian features such as the Band Stand, fountains and boating ponds. There's also the Winter Gardens with a wonderful collection of plants. After exploring the park you can follow some steps down to the road which runs along the River Dee. There's footpath here running along the river towards the railway bridge. Near here you can re-enter the park. You can continue your walking around Aberdeen by picking up the Deeside Way on the northern side of the park. This shared cycling and walking trail will take you west to Ballater with some nice riverside paths along the River Dee to enjoy. For a coastal walk in the city head north to Balmedie Country Park where there's lovely beaches and an extensive dune system. For more information on the history, climate, local attractions and transport links see the informative wikipedia page.",
