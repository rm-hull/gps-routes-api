  "description": "This splendid park is the only designated country park in Herefordshire. At Queenswood you'll find an arboretum, with over 1,200 rare and exotic trees from all over the world. There are a number of waymarked trails as well as a sculpture trail, early autumn tree trail and late autumn tree trail.  Trail highlights include the Lime Avenue, the Autumn and Summer Gardens and Cottrell's Folly. The park is located about 6.5 miles north of the cathedral city of Hereford and 4 miles south of Leominster where you can enjoy some nice trails along the River Lugg. Near here you can also visit Berrington Hall where there are some lovely trails to follow around the 250 acre estate.",
