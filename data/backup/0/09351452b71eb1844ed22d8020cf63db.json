  "description": "This pretty Somerset based village is located just a few miles south of the city of Bath. It's a lovely place for a stroll with typical village features like the historic 14th century church and a fine local pub. The village is also great for walkers sitting at the south western tip of the Cotswolds AONB and just north of the Mendip Hills. This 6 mile circular walk takes you into the lovely valley of the Wellow Brook to Midford along the old railway line. You then pick up the Limestone Link and the old Somerset Coal Canal to visit the delightful village of Combe Hay with its impressive Manor House.",
