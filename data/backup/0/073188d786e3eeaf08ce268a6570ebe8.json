It has a small shopping centre, a village hall, at least three churches and a number of schools. It has a substantial park bordering the countryside. There are a few small restaurants, and three pubs."

  "description": "This West Midlands based village is located just south of Solihull . Local walking highlights include easy waterside paths along the Grand Union Canal which runs just to the east. The Knowle Canal Walk covers this section of the canal, visiting the Grade I listed Grimshaw Hall in Knowle and the National Trust's Baddesley Clinton . This walk starts from the train station and explores Dorridge Park on the southern side of the village. The local park includes free car parking, woodland trails, a nature reserve and a children's play area. You then continue south on country lanes to Packwood House , an historic National Trust property. There's some beautiful gardens, splendid topiary and a nice circular trail around a large lake here.",
