  "description": "This scenic area of the Peak District is close to a number of walking highlights and includes an excellent local inn for post walk refreshment. This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the area at Tittesworth Reservoir, The Roaches and Hen Cloud. The walk starts in the village and heads west past the Hollies to Tittesworth Reservoir. The route then heads north along the Staffordshire Moorlands Walks before turning north east towards Windygates. You then climb up to the Roaches for splendid views over the area. After exploring the Roaches you head south to climb to the neighbouring Hen Cloud. The route then descends to Upper Hulme before heading along Whitty Lane. You then retrace your steps back to the village.",

The pub was named by CAMRA in 2019 as having one of the top ten beer gardens in the UK. You can find them on the Buxton Road at postcode ST13 8TW for your sat navs. In the little hamlet of Upper Hulme there's Ye Olde Rock Inn to consider as well. The historic pub dates back over 200 years while the original part of the building dates back further and is believed to have been constructed in the late 17th Century. It was originally used as a house for the Mill Manager, responsible for the production of textiles in the working part of the village in the valley below. The pub serves a fine Sunday lunch and also have pool room to the rear of the pub."
