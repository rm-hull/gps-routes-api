  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this reservoir in Glen Isla, north west Angus. For the past 30 years, the Backwater Reservoir has supplied the residents of Angus with their water. This walk takes you around the reservoir and includes two climbs to hills overlooking the water. It's a wonderfully peaceful area with the large reservoir surrounded by attractive countryside and forest. Start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the reservoir. Then follow the footpaths along the western side of the water before climbing to Hare Cairn. At over 500m (1640ft) there is a great view from the top of the hill. The route then heads along the eastern side of the reservoir, climbing Creigh Hill before returning to the car park. From Creigh Hill there are more nice views back down to the reservoir. The Cateran Trail runs just to the west of the reservoir, through the village of Kirkton of Glenisla. You can pick up the trail and follow it south towards Alyth. You could also head south and visit the pretty Lintrathen Loch which is a great place for wildlife watching.",
