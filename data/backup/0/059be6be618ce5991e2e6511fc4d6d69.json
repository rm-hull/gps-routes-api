  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the Birnie Loch and Gaddon Loch Nature Reserve in Colessie in North East Fife. The waterside paths at the lochs are a pleasant place for an easy stroll. You can start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the site and then pick up the footpaths taking you around the two lochs. As you make your way around the loch look out for a variety of wildfowl on the water. The site is located a few miles west of Cupar.",
