  "description": "This walk visits the Whilton Locks flight on the Grand Union Canal near Daventry . The flight of seven locks is also known as Buckby Locks and is a popular place for a walk. The route starts in the Northamptonshire village of Braunston at the pretty marina. From here you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it east to Braunston Tunnel, passing a series of pretty locks on the way. You then walk over the tunnel before continuing along the towpath to Buckby Top Lock and Whilton Locks. The locks are numbered from 7 at the top of the flight to 13 at the bottom. To the south of the flight is a long level pound, which runs to the Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum and the top of the Stoke Bruerne flight of seven locks. Towards the southern end of this section are Blisworth Tunnel and Gayton Junction, where the Northampton Branch turns off to join the River Nene at Northampton. To extend the walk continue south from the locks to Muscott and Weedon Bec. Here you can pick up the Nene Way and Macmillan Way long distance trails to explore the lovely Nene Valley",
