  "description": "This is a popular walk which takes you from the medieval Helmsley Castle to the fascinating ruins of Rievaulx Abbey. It makes use of the Cleveland Way National Trail takes place on a good, waymarked footpath. The walk runs for about 4 miles on an undulating path with some moderate climbs. As such a reasonable level of fitness is required. The walk starts at Helmsley Castle and heads west passing Duncombe Park with its spectacular landscape garden, the National Centre for Birds of Prey, and the surrounding parkland all open to the public. The walk continues through woodland to Griff Farm before a lovely waterside section along the River Rye takes you to Rievaulx Abbey. You can explore the ruins of the former Cistercian abbey before continuing to the beautiful Rievaulx Terrace. These 18th-century landscape gardens contain woodland, grass banks, wildflower meadows and two temples. The terrace is perched high above the abbey so there are stunning views down to the ruins. If you'd like to extend your walk then you could continue west along the Cleveland Way to the Hambleton Hills or explore the wonderful parkland and gardens of Duncombe Park . For a longer walk to the abbey try the Helmsley Circular Walk which explores more of the lovely Rye Dale scenery. A few miles south east of Helmsley you will find the 17th century manor house of Nunnington Hall. Here you can try the Nunnington and the River Rye Walk which explores the countryside surrounding the hall.",
