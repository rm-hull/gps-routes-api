The quarry was opened 1842 and reached its peak after the construction of a railway link with Clynderwen in the 1870's. From c.1870 onwards Rosebush expanded to employ well over 100 people, with an output of 5000 tons, supporting a village community with a railway, hotel and chapel. It was a welcome source of employment in an impoverished area but the operation came to an end around the turn of the century."

  "description": "This walk visits Bellstone Quarry and Rosebush Quarry in the Pembrokeshire village of Rosebush. You can start the walk from the village which lies on the southern slopes of the Preseli Hills. The village has a quarrying history with the slate exported by the Narberth Road and Maenclochog Railway. The railway ran from Clynderwen (formerly Narberth Road) on the Great Western Railway via Maenclochog to Rosebush. From the village you can follow a trail north for about half a mile to visit the quarries. It's an interesting place to explore with picturesque hidden pools and an arched underground tunnel cut into the hillside. It's a quite unique landscape with steep cliff faces, heath, grassland and pine trees. You can also look out for wildlife including Peregrine Falcons. Notably, the quarry supplied slate for the roof of Westminster Palace. To continue your walking in the area head north east to climb to the splendid viewpoint at Foel Cwmcerwyn, the highest point in Pembrokeshire and the Preseli Hills. The ancient hillfort at Foel Drygarn is also located just to the north east. To the west there's also the pretty Rosebush Reservoir to see.",
