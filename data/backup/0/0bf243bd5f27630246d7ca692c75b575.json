In my opinion that's a shame it has been interesting to see how the moor has been slowly reverting to (mainly) birch woodland since the sheep were taken off, probably about 35 years ago. Derbyshire is not short of sheep-grazed moorland, but a natural mixed wood - that's something special."

  "description": "This upland area near the Derbyshire village of Stanon-in-Peak has good walking trails, attractive woodland and fascinating ancient historical sites to visit. You can start the walk at the village of Stanon-in-Peak near Matlock. The village has a 19th century Parish Church, Stanton Hall stately home and several fine stone houses. Just to the east of the village you can pick up public footpaths to take you across the moor. The area is geologically significant with several pillars of sandstone dotted around the edge of Stanton Moor. There are also four Bronze Age stone circles including the well known Nine Ladies. The site is owned by English Heritage and is a popular attraction for walkers and photpgraphers. You could also start your walk from the village of Birchover to the south of Stanton Moor, if you prefer. See the Nine Ladies Stone Circle Walk for more details. The village is also located near the splendid rock formation at Robin Hood's Stride and Doll Tor stone circle which dates from the bronze age. To extend your walking in the area you could visit Sheepwalk wood just north of the moor. Two long distance footpaths also run past the western and eastern side of the area. The Derwent Valley Heritage Way can be followed through Darley Dale to Matlock along the River Derwent. The Limestone Way can be followed towards nearby Youlgreave .",
