  "description": "Enjoy the woodland trails, lakeside paths and beautiful gardens surrounding this 19th-century house in County Down. The footpaths are surfaced and well laid out so it is a nice easy walk for families or anyone looking for a peaceful afternoon stroll. There's 950 acres (380 ha) of National Trust managed estate to explore through farmland, woodland, orchards and a walled garden. The highlight is probably the lovely 7 acre lake which is surrounded by paths lined with Rhododendrons, Azaleas and Magnolias. There's also statues, follies and other interesting structures such as the Temple of the Winds. From this octagonal building there are great views towards Strangford Lough, the Mourne Mountains and Belfast Hills. The area is great for wildlife spotting too. Look out for buzzards, red squirrels and various butterflies around the meadows. The Strangford Lough Cycle Route runs close to the estate so if you wanted to visit by bike you could follow the trail from Newtownards before turning right down Ballycastle Road toward the estate. You can virtually explore the paths of the estate on the google street view link below!",
