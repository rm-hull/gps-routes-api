  "description": "This circular walk explores the Anglesey village of Rhosneigr, visiting Llyn Maelog and the pretty beach. The village is located in the south-west of the island and notable as the most expensive place to live in Anglesey in terms of house prices. There are three lovely beaches including one which stretches from the Afon Crigyll estuary to the Cymyran Strait. This easy walk around the village runs for about 2 miles on a series of flat public footpaths giving fine views of the area. The walk starts on the eastern side of the village where you can pick up a footpath heading north along Llyn Maelog. You can follow the path around the lake before crossing the road to reach the beach. Here you can explore the beach and dunes before returning to the start point. On the walk look out for a wide variety of birdlife in the reedbeds around the lake. These include Grey heron, snipe, reed warblers, coots, mallard and shelducks. The walk is accessible from the train station at the northern end. It's a short stroll south to the lake edge from there.",
