  "description": "This circular walk takes you to a chalk hill figure on Milk Hill near the Wiltshire village of Alton Barnes. The walk additionally visits the neighbouring village of Stanton Bernard and the Kennet and Avon Canal which runs past Alton Barnes. The walk starts in the village at the Barge Inn on the canal at Honeystreet, just south west of the village. You first follow the canal east before following a section of the Sarsen Way north to reach the hill. Here you can enjoy some excellent views of the White Horse and over the Vale of Pewsey. The route then descends to Stanton Bernard where you can pick up the canal towpath. Follow this east and it will return you to the pub.",
