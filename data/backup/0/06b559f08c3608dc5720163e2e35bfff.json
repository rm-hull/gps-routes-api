  "description": "Follow the River Sheaf from Sheffield to Beauchief on this pleasant waterside walk in Yorkshire. The waymarked trail starts from Granville Square in the city centre of Sheffield, just south of the train station, near the river's confluence with the River Don . The 5 mile trail then heads south west passing Hutcliff Wood, Millhouses Park and Abbeydale before finishing near Beauchief. Here you could visit Beauchief Abbey, a medieval monastic\u00a0house with parkland and ancient ruins to see. Millhouses Park is also worth exploring with its woodland, river trails and attractive boating lake to see. As of time of writing there are also talks for a Sheaf Valley Cycle Route which would run from the City Centre to Woodseats Road via Shoreham Street and Little London Road. You can see more information by clicking here . To continue your waterside walking in the city you could try the popular Five Weirs Walk and the Sheffield Canal Walk which starts at the nearby Canal Basin.",
