  "description": "Follow the John Muir Way along the East Lothian Coast on this walk named after the father of the environment movement, John Muir. Muir grew up in Dunbar before emigrating to the USA where he established America's National Parks (video below). The walk is often completed in 5 sections: Fisherrow ( Musselburgh ) to Cockenzie Cockenzie to Aberlady Aberlady to North Berwick North Berwick to Dunbar Dunbar to Dunglass You will pass sandy beaches, cliffs, dunes and rolling lowland all to the backdrop of the Lammermuir Hills. The route also passes by rivers, woodland and waterfalls. Wildlife lovers should look out for a variety of seabirds such as gannets, terns and curlew. The walk also takes you through the delightful John Muir Country Park. Here you can explore the Dunbar Castle ruins, the Peffer Burn, a Cliff Top Trail with fine views of the sea and the historic Bass Rock, the long sandy sweep of Belhaven Bay and the River Tyne estuary(video below). Just to the south of Dunbar you could take a detour from the trail and visit the Dunbar Bear. The large bear sculpture celebrates the life of the locally born John Muir. The sculpture symbolises the role Muir played in establishing the Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks where the brown bear has survived and thrived. Named signs serve as waymarks for the route.",

On the western fringes of Edinburgh there's a lovely section through the Cammo Estate. The historic park includes some splendid trails with lakes and the photogenic Cammo Tower to see. At Dirleton a section of the walk runs along the fascinating Dirleton Solar Walk. The educational walk will take you along a wonderful scale model of the Solar System with some splendid countryside views to enjoy too."
