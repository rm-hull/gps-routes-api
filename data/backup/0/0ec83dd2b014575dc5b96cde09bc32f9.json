  "description": "The climb to Loughrigg fell from Grasmere is a very popular one. It's a reasonably straightforward climb with wonderful views over Rydal Water and Grasmere Lake. The walk starts in the centre of Grasmere and follows country lanes and good footpaths to the 335 m (1,099 ft) summit. You start by following Red Bank road from Grasmere which runs around the western side of the lake before picking up a footpath to the summit which is effectivley a series of stone steps. The route also passes Loughrigg Terrace which is well worth a short detour. This level path affords wonderful views towards Helm Crag and the Fairfield group and leads to the fascinating Loughrigg Caves. From the Loughrigg Fell summit there are lovely views of Elterwater, Langdale, the Coniston Fells and Windermere. You will also find an Ordnance Survey triangulation column beside a large cairn. The fell is on the Windermere Way circular walk, so you can pick this up to extend your walk. You could also descend the hill to the south and visit the tranquil Loughrigg Tarn and continue to Elterwater where you can enjoy a waterside stroll along the River Brathay and visit Skelwith Force waterfall.",
