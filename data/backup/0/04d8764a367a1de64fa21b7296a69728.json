  "description": "This park follows the River Tyne for four miles through 200 acres of meadows, chalk grassland, woodland and river bank. The park is great for both walkers and cyclists with the Hadrian's cycleway running along the riverside. Hadrian's Wall Path also runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along this path. The park is a short walk from Wylam and Prudhoe train stations and Tyne Valley bus routes. It is about 6 miles west of the centre of Newcastle Upon Tyne and Gateshead. The Ovingham Walk starts from the park. The circular walk visits Ovington and the peaceful Whittle Dene Woods just to the north.",
