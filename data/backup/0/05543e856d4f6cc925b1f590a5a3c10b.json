  "description": "This is a shared cycle and walking bridleway which forms a loop around Staple Fitzpaine in the beautiful Blackdown Hills AONB. A good start point for the route is the car park at the ancient earthworks of Castle Neroche. The route primarily follows a series of off road tracks through wooded areas including Staple Park Wood, Piddle Wood, Thurlbear Wood and Birkenhall wood. For cyclists, a mountain bike is advised as several of the off road sections are quite challenging.",
