  "description": "This Herefordshire based village is in a lovely spot near to the River Wye and some attractive bluebell woodland. This walk from the village visits Fownhope Park Woods before exploring the nearby Haugh Woods . There's miles of peaceful woodland trails and lots of bluebells to look out for in the spring months. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north to visit Fownhope Park. The route then heads through the woods before meeting up with the Wye Valley Walk on the eastern side. Head south and then east and you can enter the more expansive Haugh Woods. The woods are notable for the popular Butterfly Trail where you can look out for many different species of butterfly. The route heads up to the main car park where you can pick up the butterfly trail. You then head south through Haugh Wood before returning to the village.",
