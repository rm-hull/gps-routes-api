  "description": "This Herefordshire based village is in a lovely spot near to the River Wye and some attractive bluebell woodland. This walk from the village visits Fownhope Park Woods before exploring the nearby Haugh Woods. There's miles of peaceful woodland trails and lots of bluebells to look out for in the spring months. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north to visit Fownhope Park. The route then heads through the woods before meeting up with the Wye Valley Walk on the eastern side. Head south and then east and you can enter the more expansive Haugh Woods. The woods are notable for the popular Butterfly Trail where you can look out for many different species of butterfly. The route heads up to the main car park where you can pick up the butterfly trail. You then head south through Haugh Wood before returning to the village.",

The historic inn dates from 1485 so has over 500 years of history including links to the Civil War. They do excellent food and have a garden area for finer days. You can find the pub at postcode HR1 4PE for your sat navs. The New Inn is also nearby. The friendly pub also does good food and has a large lawned garden area for outdoor refreshments."

      "content": "The Heart of Oak society, holds a number of events during the year including the annual Heart of Oak Club walk, where villagers walk through the streets with sticks decorated with elaborate flower decorations behind a local silver band, stopping off at houses along the way for drinks, including the cider made from local apples.  To continue your walking in the area head north west along the Wye Valley Walk. The waymarked trail will take you to neighbouring Mordiford and Hampton Bishop before coming into Hereford. There's nice trails here along the river to the famous cathedral with its wonderful chain library. The Mordiford Loop explores the area around the aforementioned village, visiting the River Lugg on the way. If you follow the trail south it will take you to How Caple and Ross on Wye. You can also pick up the long distance Three Choirs Way in Haugh Wood. This epic walk has been devised with themes of poetry and music and links with the Three Choirs Music Festival which is held each August alternately at the magnificent cathedrals of the Three Counties (Hereford, Gloucester and Worcester). For more walking ideas in the area see the Herefordshire Walks page."
