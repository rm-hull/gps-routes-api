A Priory was founded here by Augustinian Canons from Calke Abbey about 1150 and about 50 years later an Abbey was established by Premonstratensian Canons which flourished until it became a victim of Henry VIII."

  "description": "This Derbyshire village includes the historic ruins of a 12th century abbey and some fine Peak District countryside. There's also several other listed buildings in the village including a 15th century Friar's cottage and a 300 year old pub for refreshment after your walk. This circular walk in Dale Abbey explores the site of the abbey and the adjacent Hermitage Woods where there are some peaceful woodland trails. On the way you will pass the 12th century All Saints church and the Hermit's cave - an ancient dwelling cut into the sandstone cliffs in the woods. Part of the walk uses a section of the Midshires Way. To extend the walk you could continue west along the trail and visit the woodland and lake at the 18th century Locko Park .",
