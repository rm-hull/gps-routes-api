  "description": "This circular walk in Cullingworth takes you to Hewenden Reservoir and Viaduct. Start the walk from Cullingworth Gate where you can pick up a dismantled railway line and follow it south east toward the viaduct. The impressive structure opened to passenger trains in 1883 and originally formed part of the Keighley and Thornton Branch of the Great Northern Railway. It stands at a height of 123 feet (37 m) and spans 576 yards (527 m) with 17 arches each of 16.5 yards (15 m). You can now cross the viaduct on a shared cycling and walking path. From the elevated position there are splendid views back down to the reservoir and over the surrounding countryside. Other footpaths will then take you around the water before returning to the village. To continue your walking in the area head north to visit the lovely Goit Stock Waterfall. You can reach the secluded falls by following public footpaths north from the reservoir into Goit Stock Wood. The circular Harden Beck Walk starts from the nearby village of Harden and visits the falls before heading to the reservoir. The historic village is worth a visit with a fine mid 16th century pub to invesitgate. Follow the Bradford Millennium Way south and you will soon come to Doe Park Reservoir, home to Doe Park Water Activities Centre where you can try a variety of water based activities.",

      "content": "For a similar walk in the area head south and try the Thornton Viaduct Walk. This structure was part of the GNR's Queensbury Lines running between Queensbury and Keighley. You can now walk or cycle to the top for fine views over the area. Both viaducts also form part of the Great Northern Railway Trail which runs from Queensbury to Cullingworth. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks and the Nidderdale Walks pages."
