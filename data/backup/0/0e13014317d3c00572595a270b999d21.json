  "description": "This waterside walk takes you along Tattershall Lakes and the River Bain in the Lincolnshire village of Tattershall. The walk starts in the village centre on the River Bain, next to the remains of Tattershall Castle . The 15th century castle and grounds are run by the National Trust and well worth a visit. There's a splendid view over the village and surrounding countryside from the roof top walk of the Castle tower. From the village centre it is a short walk south to the lakes. A public footpath runs along the eastern side of the lakes and the River Bain. It runs south to Dogdyke where there are views of the River Witham and a nice pub where you can enjoy refreshments before returning on the same footpaths.",
