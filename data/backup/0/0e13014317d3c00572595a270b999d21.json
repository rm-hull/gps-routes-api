  "description": "This waterside walk takes you along Tattershall Lakes and the River Bain in the Lincolnshire village of Tattershall. The walk starts in the village centre on the River Bain, next to the remains of Tattershall Castle. The 15th century castle and grounds are run by the National Trust and well worth a visit. There's a splendid view over the village and surrounding countryside from the roof top walk of the Castle tower. From the village centre it is a short walk south to the lakes. A public footpath runs along the eastern side of the lakes and the River Bain. It runs south to Dogdyke where there are views of the River Witham and a nice pub where you can enjoy refreshments before returning on the same footpaths.",

There's some lovely trails here through The Pinewoods in the centre of the village. This area also includes the interesting Kinema in the Woods. It dates from 1922, and it is the only fully functioning cinema in the UK to employ back projection. Also nearby is the historic Roman town of Horncastle where you can enjoy a stroll along the old Horncastle Canal and visit the delightful village of Kirkby On Bain."
