  "description": "This Northumberland town is in a good position for exploring the nearby Hadrian's Wall and River South Tyne. The Pennine Way National trail also passes through the area providing an opportunity to explore the surrounding countryside on a good waymarked footpath. This route from Haltwhistle uses sections of the Hadrian's Wall Path, Pennine Way, the River Tyne Trail and the South Tyne Trail to create a circular walk around the town. The walk starts at the train station and heads north along the Haltwhistle Burn to Hadrian's Wall, passing the pretty lake at Cawfields Quarry on the way. Here you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it west along the wall to the Aesica Roman Fort and the ruins of the 14th century Thirwall Castle at Holmhead. This section also passes Walltown Crags, one of the best preserved sections of the wall. At the castle you can pick up the Pennine Way and follow it south to Greenhead Cleugh, Black Hill, Blenkinsopp Common and Hartleyburn Common. Here you pick up a path along the Hartley Burn which leads north east to meet with the River South Tyne. Follow the riverside path round to Park Village, passing some pretty waterfalls on the way. Here you can pick up the South Tyne Trail and follow the trail north east along a dismantled railway line back into Haltwhistle.",
