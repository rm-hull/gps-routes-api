  "description": "These woods in Wakefield have some pleasant walking and cycling trails to try. There's a series of peaceful waymarked trails with carved scupltures, wide bridle tracks, countryside views and lots of woodland wildlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for Roe Deer, Crossbill and Great-Crested Newt. On the southern edge of the woods there's also the picturesque Cold Hiendley Reservoir. The woods are located on the western side of Wintersett Reservoir and Anglers Country Park. You can extend your outing by picking up the circular waterside walk around the pretty lakes. The Barnsley Canal also runs past the western side of the woods. To the north there's Walton Hall Park with its Georgian mansion and picturesque lake. To continue your woodland walking in the area head to Seckar Wood where there's a nature reserve, bluebells and lots of wildlife to see. You can find the wood at postcode WF4 2LE for your sat navs.",
