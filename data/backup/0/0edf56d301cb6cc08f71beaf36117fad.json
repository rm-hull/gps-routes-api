  "description": "This walk visits Ward's Reservoir and Belmont Reservoir on the West Pennine Moors. Starts the walk from the car park on Rivington Road just to the west of the village of Belmont. From here you can pick up footpaths heading east around the pretty Ward's Reservoir before picking up trails across the moors to Belmont Reservoir. It's a very scenic area with splendid moorland scenery and views to the surrounding Pennine Hills. To extend the walk head to the eastern side of the water to pick up the Witton Weavers Way . You could then follow the waymarked trail south to visit Delph Reservoir on the outskirts of Bolton. Also nearby is the climb to Winter Hill where there are great views back down to the reservoir.",
