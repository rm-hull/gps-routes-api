  "description": "This long distance trail runs for about 100 miles from Skipton in Yorkshire to Penrith in Cumbria. Starting in Skipton you will pass Skipton Castle before heading to Grassington, Buckden, Askrigg, Bolton Abbey, Garsdale Head, Kirkby Stephen , Great Ormside, Appleby-in-Westmorland and Penrith where the route finishes close to Penrith Castle. There's much to enjoy with some challenging climbs, long riverside sections, striking limenstone pavement and wonderful views over the Yorkshire Dales and the Eden Valley. The route is named after Lady Anne Clifford who renovated several of the historic Clifford family buildings you will pass on the way. These include the Barden Tower on the edge of the wonderful Bolton Abbey Estate. The trail also links up with the Dales Way and the Dales High Way at various points so you could create alterante walks using these waymarked trails.",
