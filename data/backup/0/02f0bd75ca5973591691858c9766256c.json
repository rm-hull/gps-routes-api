  "description": "The popular Kent town of Sevenoaks is surrounded by beautiful parks, gardens, woodland and several long distance walking trails. This is a nice walk from the centre of Sevenoaks, visiting the Sevenoaks Wildlife Reserve and Chipstead Lake using the Darent Valley Path and North Downs Way long distance trails. The walk starts from the train station where you can directly pick up the Darent Valley Path. If you follow the trail south east for about a mile you can visit the wonderful Knole Park with its woodland, deer, dry heathland, acid grassland and wood pasture. This walk heads north west and visits the Sevenoaks Wildlife Reserve where there's several lakes and lots of different birds to look out for. After passing the reserve you pick up a section of the North Downs Way which you could follow to the nearby village of Otford. This route heads south west before finishing at the pretty Chipstead Lake. To continue your walking around Sevenoaks try our Sevenoaks Circular Walk which uses the Greensand Way to visit Knole Park and the wonderful medieval manor house at Igtham Mote .",
