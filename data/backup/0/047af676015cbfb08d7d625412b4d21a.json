  "description": "The pretty Peak District village of Baslow gives access to a number of great walking routes. The popular village sits on the River Derwent which is spanned by a 17th-century bridge. There's also a pretty village green and nice pubs and cafes for refreshments. This circular walk visits Baslow Edge, Curbar Edge and Froggatt Edge before returning to the village along the River Derwent. There's great views from over the moors from Curbar Edge and interesting geological features. Along the river there's weirs, mills and the villages of Grindleford and Calver .",
