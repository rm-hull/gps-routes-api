  "description": "The pretty Peak District village of Baslow gives access to a number of great walking routes. The popular village sits on the River Derwent which is spanned by a 17th-century bridge. There's also a pretty village green and nice pubs and cafes for refreshments. This circular walk visits Baslow Edge, Curbar Edge and Froggatt Edge before returning to the village along the River Derwent. There's great views from over the moors from Curbar Edge and interesting geological features. Along the river there's weirs, mills and the villages of Grindleford and Calver .",

In warmer weather you can relax on the Terrace garden and enjoy fine views of the surrounding hills. You can find the pub on Church Lane at a postcode of DE45 1RY for your sat navs. The inn is also dog friendly if you have your pet with you. Also of note is the splendid Cafe on the Green. There's fine homemade food here with some particularly delicious cakes. You can find them at Nether End at postcode DE45 1SR. The Peak District Pub Walk - The Inn Way passes through the village. The circular route takes you to over 50 pubs in the National Park. It's a great one for those into walking and pub history."

      "content": "Head south from Baslow and you can visit the neighbouring village of Rowsley. The village is notable as the point where the River Wye flows into the River Derwent on the border of the Peak District National Park. It's also home to the Peak Shopping Village where there's a good range of stores and plenty of eateries for refreshment. The circular Rowsley Walk starts from the village and visits Chatsworth and the 11th century Haddon Hall which is another local historic highlight. In this area you can also visit the neighbouring village of Beeley where you can explore the expansive Beeley Moor and visit the village's excellent 18th century coaching inn. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks and the White Peak Walks pages."
