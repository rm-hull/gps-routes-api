  "description": "This walk visits an historic moated manor house in Cheshire. The National Trust owned house dates to the 16th century and has an unusual, quirky shape. You can explore the house and then enjoy a stroll around the lovely knot garden with its moat, topiary and orchard. This circular walk from the house explores the grounds before visiting the Macclesfield Canal and the nearby Rode Hall. The route makes uses of some of the waymarked long distance trails running through the area. Starting from the hall you first pick up the South Cheshire Way and follow it south east to link up with the canal at Old House Green. At Scholar Green you leave the canal to head west through the fields towards Rode Hall. The Geaorgian Hall is surrounded by lovely woodland, parkland and gardens with a popular snowdrop walk to do in February. The route then links up with the canal and follows it past Thurlwood where you pick up the South Cheshire Way again. This will take you east through the countryside to return to Little Moreton Hall.",
