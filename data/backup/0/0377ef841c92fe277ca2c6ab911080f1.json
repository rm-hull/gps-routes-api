      "caption": "The Old Rectory. This was for a period in the 1960s the home of the journalist and author Auberon Waugh. Waugh was the eldest son of the novelist Evelyn Waugh and, although he wrote several novels himself, he is perhaps best known for his satirical columns in the pages of \u0091Private Eye\u0092 and the \u0091Daily Telegraph\u0092. His output was almost guaranteed to give the average \u0091Grauniad\u0092 reader a fit of the vapours at regular intervals. Auberon Waugh died at the age of 61 in early 2001. The image was obtained from the adjacent churchyard of St Mary's. There are no privacy issues with this image; Waugh both identified the property and included a photograph of it in his hilarious autobiography."

  "description": "This little Wiltshire village near Hungerford is a lovely place for a stroll. There's the wildlife on Chilton Marsh, attractive countryside, pretty thatched cottages and nice views of the River Kennet which runs through the village. To continue your walking around the village head south east to pick up the Newbury to Kintbury and Hungerford Canal Walk along the Kennet and Avon Canal . Heading west will take you to neighbouring Ramsbury . On the way you will pass Littlecote House which is one of the area's highlights. The house dates from the mid 16th century and is surrounded by beautiful parkland and gardens. There's also an ancient Roman mosaic and the opportunity to enjoy afternoon tea at the historic house which is now run as a hotel.",
