  "description": "This circular walk visits Church Bay (or Porth Swtan) on the north-west coast of Anglesey. It's a lovely place for a walk with a beautiful sandy beach and some fine cliff top coastal paths. You can start the walk from the Church Bay car park where there's also the Swtan Heritage Museum in a delightful thatched cottage. You can step back in time and explore the cottage with its earth floor and authentic period artefacts. Outside there's also a nice garden area with a well stocked herb garden, veg plots and a small orchard of traditional fruit trees and bushes. From here you can pick up a section of the Anglesey Coast Path and follow it along the Church Bay. On the way there are glorious views across the Irish Sea towards Holy Island and the busy port of Holyhead. You can also walk down to the beach where there's rock pools, rocky outcrops and a nice sandy beach. You can then return on an inland path that will take you past St Rhuddlad's Church and the Church Bay Inn before returning to the car park.",
