During the summer months, a lifeguard station is set up on the headland for a period of three months, ensuring the safety of beachgoers. The island holds historical significance, having been granted by Queen Elizabeth I to the Church of Ireland Bishop of Ross in 1584. Amidst the turmoil of the Irish Confederate Wars, a notable event occurred when a Protestant force led by Lord Forbes recaptured the town of Clonakilty from Catholic rebels in 1642. Following this, several hundred rebels attempted to seek refuge on the island of Inchydoney. Tragically, they were intercepted and drowned by the rising tide before reaching the shores of Inchydoney."
