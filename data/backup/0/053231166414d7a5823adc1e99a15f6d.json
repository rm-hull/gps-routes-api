  "description": "This walk visits the abandoned boats and ships on the banks of the River Severn at the village of Purton in Gloucestershire. The boats were\u00a0deliberately beached beside the\u00a0river to reinforce the river banks between 1909 and 1965. The proximity of the canal to the river meant that at\u00a0high\u00a0spring tide\u00a0they were separated by little more than the width of the towpath. The vessels included steel barges,\u00a0Severn trows\u00a0and\u00a0concrete ships which were towed from the dock at\u00a0Sharpness\u00a0and released to be carried up the bank on the tide. You can now follow a section of the Severn Way along the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal past the decaying boats which provide atmospheric photo opportunities. This easy two mile walk starts in the main parking area in Purton and runs along the river to the nearby port of Sharpness. On the way you will pass the former site of the Severn Railway Bridge which was demolished in 1967. You can still see the remaining tower of the swing section over the canal. The walk also includes lovely views across the water to the surrounding Gloucestershire countryside for the duration of the route. The route finishes at impressive Sharpness dock located at the head of the Bristol Channel. The port is one of the most inland in Britain and handles ships of up to 6,000 tonnes.",
