  "description": "Fordwich is located just to the east of Canterbury and is notable as Britain's smallest town. It's a lovely place to start a walk with river paths and wildlife rich local nature reserves to explore. This walk from the town visits the Westbere Marshes in the Stodmarsh National Nature Reserve . You can follow public footpaths east from Fordwich Bridge into the reserve. The marshes includes some pleasant footpaths along the Great Stour and around a series of pretty lakes. It's a great area for wildlife with Bittern and 17 species of dragon and damselflies including the rare Scarce Chaser. You can extend the walk by heading east along the Stour Valley Walk to visit Grove Ferry where there's a popular picnic site and a Georgian riverside inn to visit. Heading west will take you into Canterbury where you can visit the famous cathedral and pick up the Canterbury Rivers and Woods Walk the Canterbury to Chartham Walk and the Canterbury to Dover Walk .",
