The ford was designed by Chris Harris from an idea by Mark Strickland. It was built for the Community Woodland using grant aid from Cydcoed."

There are two areas in BBCW : Blaen Bran farm and Coed Gwaun-y-Fferiad (Priest\u0092s Moor). Blaen Bran farm, now gone, was built into the mountainside and probably looked similar to other mountain farms of the era. Blaen Bran is the source of the Bran brook which runs down a small valley into the Afon Llwyd river. The valley became known as Cwmbran, hence the name of the town. All that remains on the former farm site are some stone walls and part of one wall of the farmhouse."

  "description": "This circular walk visits the Blaen Bran Reservoirs near Cwmbran in Torfaen county. The site includes pleasant nature trails taking you around the two small reservoirs and into the surrounding woodland. You can find the reservoirs just to the north west of Cwmbran and just south of Pontypool. There is a car parking area at the site, just south east of the reservoirs at a postcode of NP44 5AT for your sat navs. From here you can pick up the trails heading north west to the lakes and a waterfall. Then climb above the water to the north for some great views. You can extend the walk by climbing onto the moorland around Mynydd Twyn-glas.",

The long distance waymarked route starts from the city of Cardiff and runs for nearly 300 miles through the Brecon Beacons, the Cambrian Mountains and Snowdonia before finishing on the North Wales coast at Conwy."
