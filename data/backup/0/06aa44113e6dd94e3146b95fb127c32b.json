  "description": "This Cheshire based village is located in a pleasant rural spot close to Knutsford and Northwich. This walk from the village takes you south along the Peover Eye, a brook formed from several springs and field drainage in the Peover area. On the way you will pass a picturesque weir and enjoy views of the surrounding countryside. There is also the Grade I listed St Oswald's church which dates to the 16th century and includes a pretty churchyard. The route then heads east to visit Peover Hall. The 16th century country manor includes beautiful gardens which are open to the public on certain days. There's also an avenue of pleached limes, wonderful topiary, a circular lawn, a rose garden, a white garden, a pink garden and a lily pool with a summer house. See the link below for more information on visiting the hall.",
