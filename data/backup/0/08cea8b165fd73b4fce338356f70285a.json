This section of the Lancaster Canal is no longer navigable from the south, largely due to the fact that at this point the canal was blocked off by a new road when the M6 (visible to the left of the picture) was constructed in the 1960s. There are eight locks in total and although they no longer have gates, they are in remarkably fine condition."
