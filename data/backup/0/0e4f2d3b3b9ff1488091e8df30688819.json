  "description": "Comber Mere Abbey is surrounded by some beautiful parkland, woodland, lakes and gardens. The historic abbey was founded in the 1130s by Hugh Malbank, Baron of Nantwich. The expansive estate includes a 5 acre walled garden and a number of Grade II listed structures including a sandstone sundial which is thought to date from the 12th century. The site is now open to the public on certain days of the year including the spring months when there is a bluebell walk. You will have to book a place though using the more information link below.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area try the Whitchurch Canal Walk where you can enjoy a walk along the Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal. Just to the north you can pick up the South Cheshire Way and follow it west to Marbury where you'll find Big Mere and Little Mere. The worthy village of Wrenbury is also on the route and worth a visit. The settlement is a conservation area with a number of historic properties including an early 16th century church overlooking the pretty village green. To the north west there's Cholmondeley where you can explore the 19th century Cholmondeley Castle. The castle is surrounded by 70 acres of beautiful parkland and gardens with an arboretum, herbaceous borders, lakes and a fine viewpoint to enjoy. Near here there's also the market town of Malpas with its timber framed properties and noteworthy 14th century church. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
