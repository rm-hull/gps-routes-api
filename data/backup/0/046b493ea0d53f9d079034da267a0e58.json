  "description": "This circular walk explores the Rockford and Ibsley Commons in the New Forest. On the expansive commons you'll find miles of footpaths taking you to attractive heathland and woodland. The commons are also in an elevated position so there are fine views over the surrounding areas from the high points. Look out for grazing ponies and some pretty babbling brooks as you go. You can start the walk from the car park just to the east of Rockford Green and Blashford Lakes . From here you can pick up footpaths heading east to the Appleslade Inclosure and Red Shoot Wood. You then follow nice trails along the Linford Brook in the Great Linford Inclosure. The final section takes you past Bigsburn Hill before returning to the car park. To continue your walk simply head east from the car park to visit the splendid Blashford Lakes. There's lovely trails around the nature reserve where there's lots of water loving wildlife to look out for. You can also pick up the long distance Avon Valley Path there and try our Fordingbridge River Walk along the River Avon from Ibsley to Fordingbridge.",
