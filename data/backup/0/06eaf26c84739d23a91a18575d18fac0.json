  "description": "This lovely reservoir in Angus is a lovely place for a short stroll and some birdwatching. The loch is surrounded by attractive woodland and a number of bird hides. Here you can look out for wildlife including osprey, otter and various wildfowl. To continue your walking in the area head north to Backwater Reservoir . There's a nice circular trail running round the water and the opportunity to pick up the long distance Cateran Trail nearby.",
