  "description": "Visit the beautiful Lodore Falls on this walk in Borrowdale in the Lake District. The waterfall is a spectacular sight after heavy rain falling 100 feet (30 m) over a steep cascade. The walk starts from the parking area at the south eastern end of Derwent Water and follows footpaths through woodland to the falls. If you would like to extend your walk you could visit the nearby Watendlath Tarn where you will find a large tarn, a classic packhorse bridge and a delightful National Trust tea-room. Also nearby is the Ashness Bridge and Suprise View Walk where you can visit the famous packhorse bridge and climb to a popular viewpoint overlooking Derwent Water.",
