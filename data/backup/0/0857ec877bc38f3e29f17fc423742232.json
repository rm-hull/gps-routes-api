  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk through this harbourside park in Poole. The route follows a nice surfaced path along the coast from Baiter Park to Whitecliff Park with great views over Parkstone Bay to Brownsea Island and the Purbeck Hills. It follows National Cycle Route 25 and is suitable for families looking for a traffic free cycle ride or an easy coastal walk. The route starts from the Baiter car park and heads east along the waterside path. You'll see lots of sailboats in the water as you make your way to Whitecliff  rside Park where you'll pass the marina. There's also great views towards the Purbeck Hills and lots of birdlife to look out for on the water. You can extend your outing by heading west to Poole Quay and continuing to Holes Bay and the lovely Upton Country Park . Also nearby is Poole Park which has a large boating lake and a miniature railway. If you head to the coast you can try the Bournemouth to Poole Coastal Walk which starts at Poole Head. The Poole Harbour Trail passes through the park. The 40 mile circular walk is a great way to explore the many highlights surrounding the significant harbour."
