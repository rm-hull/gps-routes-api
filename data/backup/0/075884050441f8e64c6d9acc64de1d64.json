      "caption": "Forty Hall was built from 1629 for Sir Nicholas Rainton, a prominent member of the corporation of the City of London. It is now owned by the London Borough of Enfield, and its grounds make a popular open space. The house was completed in 1632/3 when Sir Nicholas and his family moved in. He was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1832 and was knighted in 1633. In 1634 he was made President of St Bartholomew's Hospital, which position he held until his death at Forty Hall in 1646. In 1640 he refused to lend money to Charles I and also refused to supply details of the wealth of his associates when requested to do so by the Crown. He was subsequently imprisoned, taken to Marshalsea and moved to the Tower of London with four other Alderman."

  "description": "This manor house in Enfield is surrounded by lovely parkland and gardens. It's a fine place for a stroll with good footpaths taking you around the estate which also includes waterside trails along the New River. The house itself is a Grade I listed building dating back to the 1620s. Today it is used as a museum which houses a permanent exhibition telling the story of the house and its estate throughout the ages. After exploring the house you can visit the lake and the noteworthy Cedar of Lebanon, one of the Great Trees of London. After exploring the hall and gardens the walk then picks up the London Loop and follows it west along the Turkey Brook towards Whitewebbs Park. Here you'll find some nice woodland trails, an ornamental pond and some picturesque small lakes. The route then follows the old course of the New River to return to the hall. You can continue your walking along the man made river to the east of the hall by picking up the New River Path. The Enfield Walk starts from the nearby market town and visits the hall as well Whitewebbs Park and the New River. It's a nice way of visiting the hall by public transport and seeing some of the other highlights of the area.",
