  "description": "This 370 acre Country Park and Nature Reserve is located less than two miles from Alloa and Clackmannan in Clackmannanshire. The centrepiece of the park is the 170 acre Gartmorn Dam reservoir which has a lovely waterside path and is surrounded by peaceful woodlands. The park is very good for wildlife watching - look out for woodpeckers, roe deer, hare and red squirrels in the woodland areas and various wildfowl on the reservoir. Other features in the park include an 18th century Ice House, the 19th century kitchen garden, a bird hide, picnic areas and a visitor centre. If you'd like to continue your walk/cycle then the Dunfermline to Alloa path runs just to the south of the park. It follows National Cycle Network route 764 and the trackbed of a disused railway line from Dunfermline to Alloa via Clackmannan and Carnock.",

There's lots of good waterside footpaths to enjoy at these venues. The National Trust's splendid Dollar Glen is just a few miles north east while to the north there's Alva Glen with its lovely waterfalls and views of the Ochil Hills. Near here there's trails along the River Devon and a series of lovely reservoirs in Glendevon. There's also the Cleish Hills to explore around the pretty Loch Glow."
