  "description": "This border town in Powys is surrounded by the gorgeous countryside of the River Teme valley. There's some riverside walking trails, a major long distance footpath and several decent local hill climbs where you can enjoy wonderful views over this beautiful area. The town is also notable as the start point for the The Glyndwr's Way National Trail. This route from the town uses sections of the Offa's Dyke Path and the Jack Mytton Way to create a circular walk around the surrounding countryside. On the way there are some splendid views into England and Wales with a pleasant riverside stretch along the River Teme to enjoy as well. The walk starts in the town centre and heads north to cross the River Teme before climbing to the 406 metre high Cwm-sanaham Hill. There's some splendid views  over the surrounding landscape from this elevated spot. The rpoute continues north to Garbett Hall. You continue round to Llandishop Wood, before turning south to Lloyney. The route then heads south east along a country lane, passing Skborry Green, with some fine views of the River Teme valley as you go. You pass Panpunton Hill before crossing the river and returning to Knighton. The Glyndwr's Way passes south of the river so this could be used to make a slightly longer circular walk.",
