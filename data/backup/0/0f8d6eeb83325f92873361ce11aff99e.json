Some bricks can still be seen on the right."

  "description": "This Yorkshire based village sits just to the west of Coxwold in the North York Moors area of the county. The village is a pleasant place for a walk with a pretty village green and a church dating back to the 12th century. This circular walk from the village visits Coxwold and the historic sites at Byland Abbey and Newburgh Priory . The ancient sites are two of the highlights of the local area and include lovely grounds and gardens to stroll around. On the return leg the walk passes close to the old railway line and the site of the Husthwaite Gate Railway station. Along the way there's some lovely views of the surrounding countryside and hills. To continue your walking in the area head to the nearby Sutton Bank and the Kilburn White Horse . It's another major walking highlight with some wonderful views over the area to enjoy.",
