  "description": "This attractive North Yorkshire village has some lovely riverside paths, a popular long distance trail and a delightful local woodland park to explore. The settlement also includes the Marmion Tower a 15th-century gatehouse, three storeys high and with a beautiful oriel window. The site is owned by English Heritage and a good place to learn about some of the history of the village. Just to the north east there's Nosterfield Nature Reserve to explore. There's lakes, lots of wildlife and the nearby Thornborough Henge to visit in this area. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Ripon Rowel and other public footpaths to explore the countryside and villages to the south. On the way you'll visit the neighbouring village of North Stainley, enjoy riverside paths along the River Ure and vist the lovely Hackfall Woods which lies just to the west of the settlement. The walk starts in the village on Tanfield Bridge over the River Ure. Here you can pick up the Ripon Rowel and follow the footpath east to Sleningford Watermill and North Stainley. Just to the south west of the village you'll find the Lightwater Valley Theme Park . The park is home to 'The Ultimate' one of the world's longest rollercoasters. From the village head north west to pick up a pleasant country lane which will lead you west to Musterfield and Frizer Hill. You continue north west to Coal Bank Wood before rejoining the river at High Bank. Follow the trail west and it will take you to Mickley Barras and then on into Hackfall Woods near Grewelthorpe . The delightful woods are something of a local highlight with grottos, ponds, fountains, old temples, follies, waterfalls and pretty bluebells in the spring months.",
