  "description": "Explore the Scottish Borders and visit several historical ruined abbeys on this interesting and beautiful circular walk. You'll visit Kelso Abbey, Melrose Abbey, Dryburgh Abbey and Jedburgh Abbey while there is also a waterside section along the River Teviot and views of the Eildon Hills to enjoy. For the cycling equivalent of the route see the 4 Abbeys Cycle Route. The circular trail uses a series of quiet country lanes to visit the same 4 abbeys. Most of the route is also suitable for walkers.",
