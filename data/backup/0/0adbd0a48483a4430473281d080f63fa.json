  "description": "This circular walk visits the lovely Llyn Elsi from the village of Betws-y-Coed in the Snowdonia National Park. It's about a 1 mile walk from the village to the lake where you can pick up a circular trail around the water. Start the walk from just behind St. Mary's church then steadily climb through the woodland to the peaceful lake. Llyn Elsi is surrounded by attractive woodland where you can extend your walk on a number of trails. It sits in an elevated position of about 800ft so there are lovely views towards the Carneddau range, the Glyderau range and Moel Siabod . To continue your walking in the area you can visit the splendid Fairy Glen where you'll find little waterfalls, rapids and cascades in a wooded gorge on the River Conwy. Near here there's also other lovely walks to Conwy Falls and Swallow Falls . The reservoir is located in the Gwydyr Forest area of the national park. You can find a series of other beautiful reservoirs here with more lovely walking trails.",
