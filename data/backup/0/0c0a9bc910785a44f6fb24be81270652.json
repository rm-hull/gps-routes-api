  "description": "A circular walk through the beautiful Holme Valley, visiting a series of picturesque villages. The walk starts at Berry Brow Railway station near Huddersfield and first heads south to Holmfirth with a lovely stretch along the River Holme at the start. Holmfirth is a popular tourist destination as it is used as the location for the Last of the Summer Wine television series. The path then takes you around a series of beautiful reservoirs surrounding Holmbridge including Digley Reservoir , Holme Styes Reservoir , Brownhill Reservoir and Ramsden Reservoir . A wooded section and several delightful country lanes then lead you to Hepworth . From here you head towards Thurstonland and Farnley Tyas before coming to the fascinating Castle Hill Iron Age Hill Fort. It is a Scheduled Acient Monument and the most conspicuous landmark in Huddersfield. From the summit there are wonderful panoramic views over the surrounding Kirklees countryside. The path then descends back to the finish at Berry Brow station. This is a challenging walk with a number of ascents giving stunning views of the Holme Valley and the Holme Moss TV transmitter.",
