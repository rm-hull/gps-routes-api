  "description": "This route links two of the Peak District's popular villages. It runs from Hope to Edale, via Hollins Cross, for a distance of just over 4 miles. There's lovely views of the Hope Valley and a moderate climb along the way. Start the walk from the centre of Hope village where there is a public car park and a train station to the east. The walk then heads south and then west, picking up a public footpath running along Peakshole Water, a tributary of the River Noe. This will lead you into Castleton where there's a great selection of pubs to stop for refreshments. From Castelton you head to the north west, passing Dunscar Farm before climbing to Hollins Cross. This hill lies on the Great Ridge which separates Castleton and Edale. Hollins Cross is the lowest point on the ridge and is therefore a popular route taken by walkers wishing either to cross from one side to the other. There's splendid views down the ridge to Mam Tor and beyond. From here you descend a short distance to Edale, crossing the River Noe on the way.",
