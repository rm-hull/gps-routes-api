  "description": "This interesting country park is located just to the west of the town of Cramlington in Northumberland. At the park you'll find a huge land sculpture in the shape of a reclining female figure, known as the Lady of the North.  It was opened in 2012 by Princess Anne and is thought to be the largest land sculpture in female form in the world. There's some nice trails to follow around the park which also includes a visitor centre and some lakes. You can climb the sculpture and enjoy fine views over the surrounding area from the 34 metres (112 feet) high point. You can start the walk from the car park just off Blagdon Lane, west of Cramlington. Just a couple of miles south of the park you can extend your walk around Weetslade Country Park. The former colliery site includes a nature reserve with lots of wildlife to see. There's also some fine walking trails and cycle paths to enjoy here.",
