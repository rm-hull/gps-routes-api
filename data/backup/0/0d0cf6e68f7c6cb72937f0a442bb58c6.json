The historical folly dates back to the 18th century. It was constructed to commemorate the British colony of Vandalia, a colony that eventually disappeared as the American colonies evolved. The Vandalian Tower is situated on the summit of Tower Hill and serves as a fascinating relic of the past. This folly, with its unique design and historical significance, adds a distinctive charm to the landscape."

  "description": "This walk visits the National Trust's Uppark House in South Harting West Sussex. The 17th-century house is surrounded by pleasant grounds with woodland and gardens to explore. The author H.G Wells stayed in the house during the late 19th century. The class divisions he observed here inspired his socialist views which later manifested themselves in work such as 'The Time Machine'. The house is located just a mile west of Harting Down where you can extend your outing on a number of good cycling and walking trails. You can also pick up the South Downs Way National Trail and climb to a fine viewpoint in this area. Queen Elizabeth Country Park, Iping Common and Stedham Common are other good local options.",
