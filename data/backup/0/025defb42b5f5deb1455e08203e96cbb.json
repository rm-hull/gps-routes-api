  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around the Fleet Pond Nature Reserve in the Hampshire town of Fleet. The lake has nice footpaths to follow around the perimeter with additional woodland trails to the east and south of the water. It is the largest freshwater lake in the county at 52 acres. The walk starts from the on site car park but you could equally begin from Fleet Railway Station which borders the northern edge of the lake. From here you can pick up the trails heading around the water with lots of wildlife spotting opportunities. The reserve's habitats of reed beds, marshes, heathland and woodland attract a diverse range of birds and amphibians. Other highlights in the reserve include the pretty Brookly Stream, fine Scots Pine specimens, bamboo, rhododendron and laurels. In the summer months there are also a wide variety of wildflowers which attract a number of butterflies. The reserve includes 3 colour codes waymarked trail of varying length. All are easy walking on flat paths so suitable for all abilities. The Brenda Parker Way long distance trail runs through the reserve. To extend your walk you could pick up the trail and head south through the Forest of Eversley to Aldershot. Just a couple of miles to the north east you will find Hawley Lake near Farnborough. There's more nice waterside and woodland trails to be found here.",

      "content": "To the west of the town you could visit the village of Hartley Wintney and enjoy a walk to the nearby Basingstoke Canal and the adjacent Dogmersfield Park. The village sits on the edge of the expansive Bramshill Forest where you can explore the RSPB's Hazeley Heath and look out for red kites, dartford warblers and deer. In nearby Hook there's some pleasant trails along the River Whitewater in the pretty Bassets Mead park on the eastern side of the town. A couple of miles north of the lake there's Yateley Common Country Park. It's an expansive area of woodland and heathland with miles more trails to enjoy. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
