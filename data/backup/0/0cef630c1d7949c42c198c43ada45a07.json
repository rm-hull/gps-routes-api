  "description": "This popular circular walk from Ventnor takes you to the picturesque Steephill Cove. The coastal section to Castle Cove and Steephill Cove runs for about 1.5 miles on a fairly flat path. The cove lies just to the south west of Ventnor and includes kiosks, self-catering cottages and a pretty beach. The walk also passes the Ventnor Botanic Gardens which are well worthy of a visit. The Mediterranean style gardens include a number of interesting plants which are generally considered too tender for much of mainland Britain. After exploring the gardens and the cove you can link up with a section of the Stenbury Trail. Follow it north and you can climb to Rew Down and Week Down where you can enjoy some fabulous views back to the coast. The route then descends past Steephill and Lowtherville to return to Ventnor. To extend your walking the area pick up the Shanklin to Ventnor Coastal Walk which will take you in the other direction to neighbouring Shanklin via Luccombe. For more great views try the Ventnor Downs Walk which visits the highest point on the Isle of Wight.",

The Shanklin to Ventnor Railway Walk starts from Shanklin train station and will take you to Wroxall and Ventnor via the old railway line. The first section to Wroxall is also suitable for cyclists."
