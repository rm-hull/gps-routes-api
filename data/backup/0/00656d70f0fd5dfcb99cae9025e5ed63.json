  "description": "This walk visits Naseby Reservoir in Northamptonshire. You can start the walk from the village of Naseby and follow Carvells Lane to the water. There's nice views across the water and the option of continuing along a bridleway to the nearby village of Cold Ashby. You could stop for refreshments here before following the same path back to Naseby. To continue your walking in the area try the Naseby Battlefield Walk which takes you around the site of one of the most famous battles of the English Civil War in the 17th century. The route also visits Welford and Sulby Reservoir where there are some nice waterside trails.",
