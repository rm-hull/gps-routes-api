  "description": "Enjoy walking and cycling trails in these woods near Tamworth. There's 385 acres of ancient woodland to explore with the Coventry Canal running through the eastern edge of the forest. For mountain bikers there are opportunites for some fun off road cycling with natural single track, dirt tracks and some short steep descents. You can gain access to the woods from the village of Hopwas by following the canal into the woods and then picking up the bridleways. If you head south along the canal you can pick up the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and head towards Tamworth and Birmingham to extend you outing. Our Tamworth Canal Walk is another good option for exploring the town.",
