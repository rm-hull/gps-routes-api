  "description": "Enjoy a coastal walk on this beautiful headland near Whitehaven. The walk along the cliff top path from St Bees is an exhilarating experience with fabulous views of the Isle of Man and the Cumbrian mountains and coast. The area is also an RSPB Nature Reserve with the largest seabird colony in north-west England. These include Guillemots, kittiwakes, fulmars and razorbills. You may also see dolphins and porpoises. The walk starts near the village of St Bees at the coastal car park. You then head north to Fleswick Bay where you will find a nice shingle beach surrounded by high sandstone cliffs. You continue to North Head, the most westerly point of Northern England. Here you will pass St Bees Lighthouse with views towards Saltom Bay and Whitehaven. You can turn it into a longer circular walk by continuing along the coast and returning on country lanes through Sandwith and Rottington. The Cumbria Way passes St Bees Head so you could extend your walk by following the path to nearby Whitehaven. Alternatively you could start the walk from the town which is just over 6 miles away. It's a great cliff top path with fabulous views and benches along the way to rest. The route runs for just over 6 miles with the option of catching the train back to Whitehaven at the end of the walk. See the Whitehaven to St Bees Coastal Walk for more details. The headland is also the start point for the Wainwright's Coast to Coast Walk where you can head into the Lake District.",
