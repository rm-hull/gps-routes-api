  "description": "This climb to Lantern Pike from Hayfield makes use of the Pennine Bridleway. It's a circular walk which starts in the village of Hayfield and takes you along the Sett Valley Trail to Birch Vale Reservoir. Here you turn north and climb to the 373 metres (1,224 ft) summit of the hill. At the summit you can take in some wonderful views of the surrounding Peak District hills and countryside. The walk then descends to the pretty hamlet of Little Hayfield before crossing Middle Moor and following the Snake Path back to Hayfield. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then a walk to Kinder Scout and Kinder Reservoir is a great option.",

There's also a nice outdoor seating area where you can relax outside and enjoy views of the surrounding hills. You can find the pub in the village on 45 Glossop Rd, Little Hayfield with postcode SK222NG for your sat navs. The pub also does accommodation so you can stay over here if you need to."
