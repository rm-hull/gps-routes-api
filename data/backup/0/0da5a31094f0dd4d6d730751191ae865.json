Founded to celebrate JMW Turner\u2019s connection to Margate in 2001, the David Chipperfield designed gallery opened in 2011. There's a rolling programme of temporary exhibitions and wide windows showcasing the views that inspired painter J. M. W. Turner. The artist went to school in Margate, and visited the town throughout his life. The gallery also houses a nice cafe which is a good spot for refreshments after your exercise."
