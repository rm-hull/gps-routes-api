  "description": "Follow the River Nene through the beautiful Nene Valley on this fabulous walk through Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire. The long distance path runs for over 100 miles, passing Northampton, Wellingborough, Oundle, Peterborough and Wisbech. There's much to enjoy on the way with rushing weirs, a series of historic villages and old mills. It's an excellent area for birdwatchers too with the Nene Valley now one of the most important wetlands in England, gaining international recognition for its significance as a stop-over for thousands of wildfowl and waders that visit during the winter. In particular look out for birds around Rushden Lakes, Summer Leys Nature Reserve, the Titchmarsh Nature Reserve at Thrapston, Barnwell Country Park and Stanwick Lakes as you pass Irthlingborough and Higham Ferrers in Northamptonshire. The route links with the Knightley Way around the Northamptonshire village of Badby .",
