  "description": "This splendid cycling and walking trail runs through the beautiful Sett Valley in the Peak District. The route follows a disused railway line from New Mills to Hayfield via Birch Vale. It's a good surfaced path which provides a fairly easy ride for families. Along the way there's fantastic views of the River Sett, the pretty reservoir at Birch Vale, the Blubell Wood nature Reserve and the surrounding Peak District countryside and hills. The route finishes at the former Hayfield Station where there are good facilities including a cafe and visitor centre. Please note that West of St Georges Road in New Mills the route is unsuitable for cyclists. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could visit the wonderful Torrs Riverside Park and Millennium Way in New Mills. In the park you will find a beautiful river gorge with a fabulous 160 metre long walkway elevated over the water. You could also pick up the Goyt Way which runs along the River Goyt and the Peak Forest Canal to the nearby Whaley Bridge .",

There's also a nice outdoor seating area where you can relax outside and enjoy views of the surrounding hills. You can find the pub in the village on 45 Glossop Rd, Little Hayfield with postcode SK222NG for your sat navs. The pub is dog friendly and also does accommodation so you can stay over here if you need to. Part way along the route at Birch Vale there's The Sett Valley Cafe. The colourful and friendly cafe is very welcoming to walkers and cyclists on the trail. They serve some fine lunches and delicious cakes here. You can find them at postcode SK22 1BP."

You can use both trails to climb to the splendid viewpoint from Hayfield on our circular walk. See the video below for an idea of the scenery you can expect to see on the trail. In New Mills there's the excellent Torrs Riverside Park and Millennium Way to visit. The park is a major highlight of the area and includes a beautiful river gorge with a wonderful elevated walkway over the river. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
