  "description": "This splendid cycling and walking trail runs through the beautiful Sett Valley in the Peak District. The route follows a disused railway line from New Mills to Hayfield via Birch Vale. It's a good surfaced path which provides a fairly easy ride for families. Along the way there's fantastic views of the River Sett, the pretty reservoir at Birch Vale, the Blubell Wood nature Reserve and the surrounding Peak District countryside and hills. The route finishes at the former Hayfield Station where there are good facilities including a cafe and visitor centre. Please note that West of St Georges Road in New Mills the route is unsuitable for cyclists. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could visit the wonderful Torrs Riverside Park and Millennium Way in New Mills. In the park you will find a beautiful river gorge with a fabulous 160 metre long walkway elevated over the water. You could also pick up the Goyt Way which runs along the River Goyt and the Peak Forest Canal to the nearby Whaley Bridge .",
