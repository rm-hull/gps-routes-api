  "description": "Enjoy a stroll around the grounds of the famous cathedral before exploring the surrounding rivers, gardens and streets of this famous Wiltshire city. This three mile circular walk starts at the cathedral before heading to Mompesson House where you will pass Queen Elizabeth Gardens on the River Avon.  These lovely gardens were opened in the 1960s to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. They are a real highlight of the city with majestic lawns, beautiful flower beds, streams and riverside paths. There's also a sensory garden and great views back to the cathedral. From the park you can pick up the Town Path leading south west across the lovely Harnham Water Meadows to the Old Mill. It's a special place with lots of different types of pretty wildflower and wildlife such as egrets, kingfishers and otters to look out for. At the Old Mill you will find a picturesque mill pond and weir with a pub for refreshments. The walk then heads to Harnham where there is a short woodland section before crossing the river and returning to the cathedral. It's easy to extend your walking in the area by picking up one of several long distance trails which run through the city. You could pick up the Avon Valley Path around Harnham and follow it south through the countryside towards Odstock and Downton. Another good option is to follow the Clarendon Way east to Clarendon Palace. It's about a 2 mile walk through farmland and woodland to the fascinating medieval  ruined palace. The palace has an interesting history being used as a royal residence by Henry II, Henry III and Henry VI. Just to the north of the city you will find the earliest settlement of Salisbury, Old Sarum Castle . Here you can see the exposed foundations of the former cathedral and climb the mighty ramparts for great views of the surrounding countryside.
