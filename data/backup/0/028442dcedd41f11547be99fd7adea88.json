  "description": "This country park is located on the south western side of Billingham, on the pretty Billingham Beck. There's some pleasant nature trails with ponds, a picnic area and lots of wildlife to look out for. Birds include Herons and Sparrowhawks with water voles, weasels, rabbits, hares, and the odd deer to look out for too. Cowpen Bewley Woodland Park is only a couple of miles to the north east so it's easy to extend your outing here if you have time. The park includes a lake, a beck and some peaceful woodland trails. Wynyard Woodland Park and Coatham Woods are other good local options.",
