  "description": "This is a climb to the 1313\u00a0ft (400m)\u00a0 summit of Rough Tor on Bodmin Moor. Rough Tor is the second highest point in Cornwall and a popular spot for walkers. The walk starts from the car park at the end of Rough Tor Road which leads out of Camelford . You then climb across a wide slope of Access Land on the moor to the striking granite tor. There are super views from the summit over the moor and surrounding countryside. The area has a fascinating Neolithic and Bronze age history with\u00a0numerous\u00a0cairns\u00a0and burial monuments in the vicinity. You can extend your walk easily by visiting the nearby Showery Tor and climbing up to Brown Willy - the highest point on the moor. You could also visit Crowdy Reservoir . There's nice views across the water, woodland trails in Davidstow Woods and lots of wildlife to look out for on the lake. Around here you can also pick up the long distance Copper Trail . The epic trail takes you to many of the scenic highlights on the moor and several historic Cornish Copper mines.",
