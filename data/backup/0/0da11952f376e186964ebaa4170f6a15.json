The moors around the area offer rich opportunities for wildlife spotting. Red Grouse can be seen throughout the year, adding a splash of colour to the rugged landscape. In the rough pasture, you might also encounter Curlew and Meadow Pipit, which are often found in these habitats. Peregrine Falcons are sometimes seen soaring high above, showcasing their impressive flight skills. In spring, keep an eye on the drystone walls for Wheatear, which are known to nest in these stone structures. These walls also provide habitat for various small creatures, including mice, weasels, and the Common Lizard. The diverse wildlife adds to the natural charm and appeal of the moorland environment."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you up Darwen Hill to Jubilee Tower from Tockholes in Lancashire. The short climb to the tower gives great views over the surrounding moorland and reservoirs. The Bowland Fells and the mountains of Ingleborough and Whernside make a wonderful backdrop. On a clear day you can also see North Yorkshire, Morecambe Bay, Blackpool Tower, the Lake District and the Isle of Man. The walk starts from the car park at Tockholes and follows good footpaths to the hill summit and the tower. You can then climb the 85 feet high tower on the stone spiral staircase inside. The tower was built in the late 19th century to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. The route descends along the Witton Weavers Way , passing the attractive Sunnyhurst Hey and Earnsdale Reservoirs before returning to the car park. At Earnsdale reservoir you will find the pretty Sunnyhurst Woods . You could extend the walk by exploring the 85 acres of woodland with its streams and wide variety of birdlife. There's also nice footpaths around Roddlesworth Reservoir and the adjacent Rake Brook Reservoir.",
