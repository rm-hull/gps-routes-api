The route will take you to the Swiss Valley Reservoir before heading to the Millennium Coastal Park in Llanelli. To the north there's the splendid Dinefwr Park in Llandeilo. There's an historic 12th century castle and an 18th century landscaped park to see here. Near here there's also Gelli Aur Country Park. The park surrounds the Golden Grove mansion and includes a deer park, peacocks, views of the Tywi Valley and an aboretum with some fine specimen trees. A few miles north east of Llandeilo there's the climb to the viewpoint and two Iron Age Hill Forts on Garn Goch. To the east is Ammanford where you can enjoy nice trails through the River Amman Valley and pick up the Heart of Wales Line Trail."
