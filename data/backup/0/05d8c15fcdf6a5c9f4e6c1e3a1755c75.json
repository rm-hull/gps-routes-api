  "description": "This circular walk visits the ancient Coldrum Long Barrow before exploring the woodland trails in Trosley Country Park. The Long Barrow is about 3,000 years old and the only one in the Medway Valley to remain virtually intact. You can start the walk from the Coldrum car park located just to the east of the village of Trottiscliffe. From here you can pick up trails heading south east to the Long Barrow. There's also some fine views over the surrounding North Downs countryside here. The route then skirts the edge of Ryarsh Wood before turning north to join with the North Downs Way. Follow the waymarked trail west and it will take you into Trosley Country Park. There's a series of waymarked walking trails to follow through the attractive woodland of the park. After exploring the park the route then heads towards Trottiscliffe before returning to the car park.",

You can explore some of the other sites on the Medway Megaliths Walk. This circular route can be picked up a few miles to the east at Blue Bell Hill near Burham. It visits the Coffin Stone, Kit's Coty House and Little Kit's Coty House, constructed circa 4000 BCE. For more walks in the area see the North Downs Walks page."
