  "description": "This circular walk visits the ancient Coldrum Long Barrow before exploring the woodland trails in Trosley Country Park . The Long Barrow is about 3,000 years old and the only one in the Medway Valley to remain virtually intact. You can start the walk from the Coldrum car park located just to the east of the village of Trottiscliffe. From here you can pick up trails heading south east to the Long Barrow. There's also some fine views over the surrounding North Downs countryside here. The route then skirts the edge of Ryarsh Wood before turning north to join with the North Downs Way . Follow the waymarked trail west and it will take you into Trosley Country Park. There's a series of waymarked walking trails to follow through the attractive woodland of the park. After exploring the park the route then heads towards Trottiscliffe before returning to the car park.",
