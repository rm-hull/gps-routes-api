Wood anemones are indicators that woodland has existed on the site for hundreds of years. Bourne Wood is a rich and ancient resource: is within a short walk of Bourne town centre and sights like this are to be valued and treasured."

  "description": "Enjoy miles of woodland cycling and walking trails in this large forest in the market town of Bourne, Lincolnshire. A local cycle route runs through the eastern side of the woods to Hanthorpe while miles of footpaths take you through the ancient woodland with its mixture of conifers and broad-leaved trees. There's also some tranquil ponds which attract birds such as kingfishers and herons. Look out for sculptures by local artists as you make your way through the site. This circular route starts at the car park off West Road. The first section heads through the eastern part of the forest so is suitable for cyclists. The western section is better suited for walkers. To continue your walking in the area you could head to Willow Tree Fen Nature Reserve. Here you will find a beautiful fenland setting with meres, flooded pastures, hay meadows and reedbeds. The Macmillan Way also runs just to the south of Bourne. You can pick it up and enjoy a waterside walk along the River Glen.",

This splendid country house is surrounded by a huge deer park with miles of woodland trails and a beautiful garden to explore. A few miles to the south is the market town of Market Deeping. The historic town includes several 17th century stone buildings, a weekly market dating back to 1220 and a well known stone bridge from the mid 17th century. There's also pleasant walking trails along the River Welland to enjoy here."
