  "description": "This walk takes you to the extraordinary Mogul Indian palace of Sezincote House near Moreton-in-Marsh in the Cotswolds. The walk starts in the pretty village of Bourton-on-the-Hill and follows the Heart of England Way through the countryside to the nearby Sezincote Estate. The gardens are stunning with a curving orangery, spring-fed pools, canals and a large lake. There are also fascinating ornaments and statues including an Indian style pavilion, a temple to Surya the sun god and a snake coiled around a column in the Snake Pond. The house was built in 1805 by the grandsons of the diarist Samuel Pepys. The Prince Regent visited in 1807 and change his plans for the Royal Pavilion in Brighton after seeing Sezincote. The architect John Nash then designed the Royal Pavilion in a similar Indian style. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then the delightful Batsford Arboretum is only about a mile to the north. The pretty village of Blockley with its interesting Norman Church is also close by.",
