The park covers 250 acres of countryside combined with a 150 acre golf course that together form the High Elms estate, originally the country home of the Lubbock family. In the 1840's Sir John Lubbock II developed the new house and grounds in a classical Italian style with tree's collected from around the world. His son Lord Avebury was one of the foremost public figures of his day and was responsible for the Open Spaces act (1896) which enabled his former estate to be transferred to Bromley Council in 1965, as a Green Belt open space. Unfortunately the house was destroyed by fire, but some of the formal gardens survived and are still maintained. This is a model orchard in the old walled gardens."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you through the woodland and farmland around Cudham and Downe in Bromley. The walk passes Down House the former home of Charles Darwin and his family. It was in this house and garden that Darwin worked on his theories of evolution by natural selection and it can be found close to the walk start at the village of Downe. The house is now owned by English Heritage and includes an exciting interactive multimedia tour (narrated by David Attenborough), family rooms and extensive gardens. The walk also passes close to Biggin Hill airport and through the splendid High Elms Country Park. The park boasts 250 acres of countryside including a 150 acre golf course, woodlands, a nature centre, an ice well, formal gardens and wildflower meadows. The route runs for just under 8 miles and includes some moderate hill climbs on the way.",
