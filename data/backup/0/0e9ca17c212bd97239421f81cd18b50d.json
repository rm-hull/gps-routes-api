  "description": "This long circular walk explores some of the highlights around the Two Bridges on Dartmoor. On the walk you'll visit Wistman's Wood and enjoy climbs to Bellever Tor and Longaford Tor for great views over the area. The route runs for about 12 miles with some moderate climbs and a section along the Dartmoor Way long distance trail which runs through the area. You start off at the Two Bridges parking area on the West Dart river, at the intersection of the two roads that cross Dartmoor. It's a popular spot for walkers with a number of good trails to follow around a scenic part of the National Park. The walk begins by heading north to Wistman's Wood. The National Nature Reserve consists of a number of stunted oak trees with gnarled, tangled branches. It's an unusal and fascinating area with a variety of rarely seen flora and fauna. After exploring the reserve the walk continues north to Longaford Tor which stands at a height of 507 metres and commands lovely views over the park. From here you descend east past the old Powder Mills factory remains. The remote spot was suitable for the production of gunpowder, about 160 years ago. Today the mill stands in ruins with only a row of cottages still in use. The old school is now used as a pottery shop where you can enjoy cream teas in the courtyard in the Summer season. The route continues east into Bellever Forest. Here you'll find some nice woodland trails with Dartmoor ponies to look out for on the way. The site includes Bellever Tor which stands at a height of 443 metres offering panoramic 360 degree views. As well as the granite tor at the peak there's also several Kists and Cairn Circles on its slopes. The route then descends past Laughter Tor to Dunnabridge Pound Farm before crossing the West Dart River at Sherberton. Here you head west to pick up a section of the Dartmoor Way to take you towards Princetown, enjoying some splendid moorland scenery on the way. The route then turns north to return to Two Bridges and the finish point. To continue your walking in the area head east along the Dartmoor Way to Dartmeet. The popular beauty spot is where the tributaries of the East Dart and West Dart meet.",
