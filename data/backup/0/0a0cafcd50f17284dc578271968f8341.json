  "description": "This easy walk takes you around the lovely Daneshill Lakes Nature Reserve near Retford. There's wetlands, woodland, grassland, flowering plants and lots of wildlife to look out for on the site. Look out for grebes, swans, willow warbler, whitethroat, and blackcap on your walk. There's a free on-site car park from which you can start the walk. To the south there's the more popular open water section, while to the north there's some peaceful woodland trails to enjoy. The reserve is located just to the west of Idle Valley Nature Reserve. The expansive reserve covers 450 hectares with hundreds of species of wetland birds to look out for. To the south of the site you can pick up the Chesterfield Canal to continue your waterside walking. The towpath can be followed into Retford or towards Ranby.",
