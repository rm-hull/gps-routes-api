  "description": "This popular loop walk climbs to Great Sugar Loaf in the Wicklow Mountains. The conical\u00a0shaped mountain is located near the village of Kilmacanogue near Dublin. From the 501m (1,644\u00a0ft) summit there are wonderful views over the city to the coastline and even as far as the mountains of Wales on a clear day. The walk starts from Kilmacanogue and picks up the waymarked Sugar Loaf Trail to the west of the village. You'll then head towards Sugar Lump before climbing to the Great Sugar Loaf summit. On the way you can look also out for a wide variety of wildlife including deer, hare and buzzards. Parts of the trail are also suitable for mountain bikers.",
