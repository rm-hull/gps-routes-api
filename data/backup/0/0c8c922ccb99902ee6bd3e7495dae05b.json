The quarry produces limestone aggregates. Over 450,000 tonnes of stone is crushed each year and used for road construction and concrete products like floor beams for house construction. The quarry is operated by CEMEX, formerly known as RMC Aggregates, and employs over 70 staff. The rim of the quarry shows an unconformity between the Carboniferous Limestone and the Triassic Cotham Beds."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the Golden Valley and the old Wick Quarry near the village of Wick in the Bristol area of the Cotswolds. It's a picturesque area with the quarry surrounded by woodland and the pretty waters of the River Boyd. The quarry is no longer operational but has become a popular walking and birdwatching spot with many different species to be seen in the Golden Valley Nature Reserve. The walk starts in the village and heads north along public footpaths to Bury Manor, Naishcombe Hill and the quarry. You then head up Rock Road before turning south to cross Cleeve Bridge and the River Boyd which runs through the valley. The route then picks up a section of the Monarch's Way along Bury Lane before returning to the village.",

      "content": "If you head north east of the site you could visit the village of Doynton and the splendid Dyrham Park. Here you'll find a 270 acre deer park surrounding a 17th-century mansion. The circular Pucklechurch Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the park before heading to the pretty village of Doynton and Wick. The epic Cotswold Way National Trail can also be picked up in this area. A few miles to the south west there's Willsbridge Mill to visit. The photogenic 18th century mill has an interesting history and nice trails along the Siston Brook. Near here there's also Hanham Woods and Conham River Park to explore. The two adjacent sites form part of the wider Avon Valley Woodlands Nature Reserve. For more walking ideas in the area see the Gloucestershire Walks and the Cotswolds Walks pages."
