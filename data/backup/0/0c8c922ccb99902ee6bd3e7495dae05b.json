The quarry produces limestone aggregates. Over 450,000 tonnes of stone is crushed each year and used for road construction and concrete products like floor beams for house construction. The quarry is operated by CEMEX, formerly known as RMC Aggregates, and employs over 70 staff. The rim of the quarry shows an unconformity between the Carboniferous Limestone and the Triassic Cotham Beds."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the Golden Valley and the old Wick Quarry near the village of Wick in the Bristol area of the Cotswolds. It's a picturesque area with the quarry surrounded by woodland and the pretty waters of the River Boyd. The quarry is no longer operational but has become a popular walking and birdwatching spot with many different species to be seen in the Golden Valley Nature Reserve. The walk starts in the village and heads north along public footpaths to Bury Manor, Naishcombe Hill and the quarry. You then head up Rock Road before turning south to cross Cleeve Bridge and the River Boyd which runs through the valley. The route then picks up a section of the Monarch's Way along Bury Lane before returning to the village.",
