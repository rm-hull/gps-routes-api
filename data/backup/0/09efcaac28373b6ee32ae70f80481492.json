  "description": "This circular walk from Ravenscar visits the lovely nature reserve at Hayburn Wyke. The coastal reserve includes a lovely beach, a secluded cove, woodland trails and a pretty waterfall. The walk starts from the Ravenscar Visitor Centre where you will find a car park nearby. From here you pick up the Cleveland Way and follow it south, passing Beast Cliff and Herbert Hole. Shortly after you come to Hayburn Wyke where you walk down the path to the pretty beach and falls. Hayburn Beck runs over a seam of hard rock which has been eroded by the sea, so that the water cascades down onto the beach. After enjoying the beach the route heads inland to the Hayburn Wyke Inn which is a great place to stop for refreshments, at what is roughly the half way point on the walk. There's a good menu and a nice beer garden if the weather is fine. Near the pub there's some sheltered woodland trails leading up to a shared cycling and walking trail. This area is great for wildlife with roe deer and birds such as woodpecker, redstart, blackcap, willow warbler, and pied flycatcher. Behind the woods you can pick up the signed National Cycle Network trail and follow this north all the way back to the car park in Ravenscar. To continue your walking in the area try the Ravenscar to Robin Hoods Bay Circular Walk which starts from the same car park. There's also the popular Whitby to Robin's Hood Bay Walk which will take you between the lovely coastal town of Whitby and the picturesque fishing village.",
