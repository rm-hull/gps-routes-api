There are excellent views of the River Shannon, Curragour Falls and Clare Hills from this park. A new weir was built in recent years to allow boats access between the Abbey River and Shannon Estuary. This weir bounds the park. A small marina is located nearby. The city riverside walk also passes through the park."

A touch of folklore adds charm to the bridge's story: according to local tales, etched into the stone are the scratch marks of the Bishop's Lady. Legend has it that this curious marking stems from an unfortunate encounter with the legendary Drunken Thady, weaving a whimsical thread into the rich tapestry of Limerick's past."

The River Shannon, a formidable and tidal force, courses through the heart of Limerick, infusing the city with vitality as it wends its way toward the Shannon Estuary and eventually converges with the Wild Atlantic Way. This majestic river, named after the Celtic goddess Sionna, proudly bears the distinction of being Ireland's longest river, stretching a grand span of 360 kilometers. As the lifeblood of Limerick, the River Shannon weaves a narrative of history, commerce, and nature, shaping the landscape it graces. Its tidal surges bring a rhythmic pulse to the city, echoing the eons of stories etched into its banks. From the serene reaches within the city to the tidal dance as it meets the estuary, the river serves as both a scenic spectacle and a crucial waterway. In the quiet moments along its banks and the bustling city quarters that line its course, the River Shannon stands as a living testament to the enduring spirit of Limerick\u2014a witness to the passage of time and a symbol of the city's interconnectedness with the broader tapestry of Ireland's waterways."

The River Shannon, coursing through the heart of Limerick, is graced by the Patrick Sarsfield Bridge, the city's second crossing dedicated to Patrick Sarsfield, the Earl of Lucan. Renowned as a prominent figure in the Jacobite Army during the 1691 siege and the subsequent Treaty of Limerick, Sarsfield's legacy is immortalized by this architectural marvel. Originally conceived as a swivel bridge, the structure was meticulously designed to facilitate the passage of ships along the Shannon. A testament to engineering prowess, the Patrick Sarsfield Bridge emerged from an eleven-year construction effort and proudly opened its spans in 1835. This bridge, marked by five elegant elliptical arches, stands as a venerable guardian of Limerick's history. The enduring presence of its original lamp standards lends an air of timeless grandeur to the cityscape, casting a warm glow over the waters of the Shannon and continuing to tell the tale of Limerick's past and resilience."
