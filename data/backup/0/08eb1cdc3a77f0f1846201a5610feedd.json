  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir in Somerset. The area is also a designated nature reserve with lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for on the way. There's a splendidly positioned bird hide where you can look out for birds including little egrets, cormorants, tufted ducks and wigeon. It's a lovely, peaceful spot and well worth a look if you are visiting the area. The reservoir is located just to the north east of Chard town centre. You could start the walk from here or from the car park at the southern end of the water. Then pick up the surfaced trails heading around the site.",

      "content": "There's lots of good options for refreshments in Chard town centre but we recommend heading to the Windwhistle Inn a little out of town. The main attraction here is a lovely 5 acre garden with panoramic views. On a clear day and you can see all the way to Glastonbury Tor and the Bristol Channel from here. It's a great place to relax and enjoy a meal on a summer day. Children and dogs are welcome in this expansive area too. The inn also has an interesting history dating right back to the 17th Century when it was a notorious haunt of smugglers and highwaymen. More recently in 1902 Thomas Hardy mentioned the inn by name in his poem \"A Trampwoman's Tragedy\". It has a very good menu and a large car park too. You can find it on the A30 near Cricket St Thomas at a postcode of TA20 4DQ for your sat navs."
