  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir in Somerset. The area is also a designated nature reserve with lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for on the way. There's a splendidly positioned bird hide where you can look out for birds including little egrets, cormorants, tufted ducks and wigeon. It's a lovely, peaceful spot and well worth a look if you are visiting the area. The reservoir is located just to the north east of Chard town centre. You could start the walk from here or from the car park at the southern end of the water. Then pick up the surfaced trails heading around the site.",
