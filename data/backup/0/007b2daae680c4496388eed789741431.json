All told the brewery has 15 pubs and there is a 62 mile Cotswold walk, known as the Donnington Way, which visits each of them. Notice also the royal connection in the pub name. Pretty well all the old pub names in Stow on the Wold have royal connections of one form or another, dating back to the time of the English Civil War when the town was staunchly Royalist."
