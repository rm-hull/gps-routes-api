  "description": "The picturesque Cotswolds town of Stow-on-the-Wold has a number of popular long distance trails running through it. You can use these to make a nice circular walk visiting the surrounding countryside and villages. This 5 mile circular walk starts in the centre of Stow-on-the-Wold and follows the Gloucestershire Way to Upper Swell where there is a reservoir and a small Norman church dating from the 12th century. You then head south to Lower Swell along the Heart of England Way. It's a very pretty little village with the River Dikler, a nice village green and several mellow stone cottages. The route continues south to Hyde Mill before turning east along the Macmillan Way to Maugersbury. Country lanes then return you to  Stow-on-the-Wold. If you would like to extend the walk then you can head south west along the Gloucestershire Way at Hyde Mill to The Slaughters. Here you can enjoy a lovely walk between Lower Slaughter and Upper Slaughter along the River Eye. It's about a 4 mile walk with more details on the Stow on the Wold to the Slaughters Walk page.",
