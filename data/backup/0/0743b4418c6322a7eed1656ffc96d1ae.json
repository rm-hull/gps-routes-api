  "description": "The picturesque Cotswolds town of Stow-on-the-Wold has a number of popular long distance trails running through it. You can use these to make a nice circular walk visiting the surrounding countryside and villages. This 5 mile circular walk starts in the centre of Stow-on-the-Wold and follows the Gloucestershire Way to Upper Swell where there is a reservoir and a small Norman church dating from the 12th century. You then head south to Lower Swell along the Heart of England Way. It's a very pretty little village with the River Dikler, a nice village green and several mellow stone cottages. The route continues south to Hyde Mill before turning east along the Macmillan Way to Maugersbury. Country lanes then return you to Stow-on-the-Wold. If you would like to extend the walk then you can head south west along the Gloucestershire Way at Hyde Mill to The Slaughters. Here you can enjoy a lovely walk between Lower Slaughter and Upper Slaughter along the River Eye. It's about a 4 mile walk with more details on the Stow on the Wold to the Slaughters Walk page.",

      "content": "The village is home to Britain's oldest pub at the Porch House. The inn has an interesting history dating all the way back to the 10th century when it was thought to have been a hospice built on on land belonging to Evesham Abbey. The interior has bags of old character with wonky ceilings and a very fine 16th century fireplace. They do excellent food and also provide accommodation if you need to stay over. There's also an outdoor area for finer days. You can find the historic inn on Digbeth Street with a postcode of GL54 1BN for your sat navs."

The church is a Grade I listed building and a tourist attraction due to its history, architecture, large stained glass windows, buttresses, old yew trees and neatly kept churchyard. It's well worth a visit if you have time on the walk. You can find the historic building at 2 Crossways House the Square with a postcode of GL54 1AB for your sat navs. Stow also has a number of nice shops and art galleries to explore as well. This includes the Clarendon Fine Art Gallery on the square where there's a fine selection of artists and genres. Just a couple of miles to the east you can pick up the Daylesford Walk. This circular trail will take you around the Georgian Daylesford Estate before visiting the neighbouring villages of Adlestrop and Upper and Lower Oddington. The Donnington Way - Cotswolds Pub Walk passes through the town. The long circular walk visits 15 fine old Donnington Brewery pubs in the Cotswolds.
