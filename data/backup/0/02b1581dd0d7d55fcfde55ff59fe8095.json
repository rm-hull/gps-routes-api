  "description": "This circular walk takes you to this lovely steep-sided valley of the River Tavy in the Dartmoor National Park. It's a delightful area with the rushing water and waterfalls of the river surrounded by interesting vegetation and several large tors. The walk starts from the Lanehead car park at Higher Willsworthy. You then follow footpaths past Nat Tor before picking up a riverside path along the Tavy to Tavy Cleave. You then climb to the 1742 ft (531m) summit of Hare Tor. From here there are splendid, wide ranging views over Dartmoor. The walk then descends to Ger Tor and Nattor Down before returning to the car park. This walk is located just a couple of miles east of Lydford so if you would like to continue your walking you could visit the beautiful Lydford Gorge. Here you will find the 100-foot-high (30-metre) 'White Lady Waterfall' in a lovely wooded glade.",
