    "description": "This pretty little village in the North York Moors makes a fine base for walkers. There's a notable pub/hotel, an interesting museum dedicated to a well known local author and the historic Byland Abbey and Newburgh Priory just a stones throw away. This circular walk from the village visits three of the historic highlights of the area at Newburgh Priory, Shandy Hall and Byland Abbey. The walk starts from the public car park in the village and first heads south to pay a vist to Newburgh Priory. The priory dates back to 1145 and includes grounds with a water garden, hand crafted topiary, a walled garden, woodland and a large lake. You then return to the village and follow a road west to Shandy Hall. The author Laurence Sterne wrote the well known novel 'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy' here. You can now explore the old hall and learn about Sterne in the interesting museum. At the hall you can pick up public footpaths heading north into the countryside. After reaching Cams Head you turn north west towards Olstead before turning east into Snever Wood. Here you'll pass the Mount Snever Observatory, a disused stone tower built in 1837 which originally contained a large telescope. Follow the woodland trails south east and they will take you towards Wass where you turn south to visit Byland Abbey. Here you can explore the extensive ruins of the 12th century abbey buildings. After exploring the abbey the walk heads west and then south to return to the village.",
