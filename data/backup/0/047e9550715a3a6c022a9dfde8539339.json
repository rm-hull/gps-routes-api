  "description": "This walk takes you from the village of Kemble to the source of the River Thames at Thames Head, in Gloucestershire. The walk starts from the train station in the village. You can catch a train direct from London Paddington, Cheltenham or Gloucester. Head east from the station and you will soon come to the Thames Path National Trail. It's about a 1.5 mile walk north along the path to Thames Head. Here you will find a monument with an inscription to mark the source of the river. A nearby basin of stones marks the spring, although there is usually only water present during a wet winter. You can return to the village on the same path and then visit the interesting village church. It contains a Norman door and a tower dating from 1250, to which a spire was added in 1450. You can extend the walk by continuing north west along the Thames and Severn Canal, past Trewsbury House and into Hailey Wood. The Monarch's Way and Macmillan Way long distance trails also pass through the area. You can pick them up just to the north of Thames Head and then follow them deeper into the Cotswolds. If you prefer you could visit the site from Cirencester. Just follow the Monarch's Way west from the town and it will take you straight to Trewsbury House where you turn south to get to the source. If you follow the Thames Path in a south easterly direction you will soon come to the splendid Cotswold Water Park. Here there are miles of cycling and walking trails to follow around the 150 lakes.",
