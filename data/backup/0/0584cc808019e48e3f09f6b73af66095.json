A few miles to the north west there's miles of woodland trails to enjoy in the expansive Glenariff Forest Park and Ballypatrick Forest. The epic Gobbins Cliff Path and the Blackhead Lighthouse are further south along the coast and well worth a visit. A few miles to the south there's the Woodburn Forest near Carrickfergus. Here you'll find miles of good woodland trails and a number of attractive reservoirs. Also nearby is the Glenoe Waterfall. The picturesque falls are located in the pretty village of Glenoe in County Antrim. It's a fine place for a walk with pleasant trails taking you through peaceful woodland to the 30ft high waterfall."
