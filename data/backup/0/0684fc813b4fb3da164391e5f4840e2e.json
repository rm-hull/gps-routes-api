  "description": "Travel along the beautiful Lancashire coast from Silverdale to Freckleton on this fairly easy walk. You start off at Silverdale and head south to Morecambe Bay passing Warton and Bolton le Sands . At Morecambe you'll pass the Eric Morecambe statue with great views over the bay towards the Lake District. There's also a great deal of coastal wildlife to look out for including Cormorants, Curlews, Lapwings and Oystercatchers. The area includes Hest Bank and is a RSPB reserve with sandflats and saltmarshes that attract thousands of birds. As such it is considered the second most important estuary in the UK. From Morecambe you head inland towards Lancaster and along the River Lune to Glasson Dock . The next section takes you to along Cockerham Sands to Knott End on Sea where you catch the ferry to Fleetwood and continue south towards the world famous seaside resort of Blackpool with the iconic tower and pleasure beach. The final section runs through the pretty resort of Lytham St Annes with Fairhaven Lake at Ansdell, views over the Ribble Estuary and the landmark windmill on Lytham front the highlights. From Lytham you continue to the finish point at the village of Freckleton. There's lots of wildlife to look out for on the river and views of the planes taking off as you pass Warton Aerodrome on this final leg. There's also good views of the Pennine Hills and the Bowland Hills as you finish the walk.",
