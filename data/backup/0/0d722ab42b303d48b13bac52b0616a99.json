  "description": "This short circular walk explores the countryside around the Oxfordshire village of Bodicote near Banbury . The trail runs for just over 3 miles on waymarked footpaths, visiting several of the local highlights. You'll pass near to some of the village's historic buildings including the restored 19th century windmill, the 13th century church and the Georgian Bodicote House which\u00a0is now the main office for\u00a0Cherwell District Council. The walk starts on the High Street in the village centre. From here you head north before turning west along the Salt Way. Country trails then lead south past Wykham Farm and Bodicote Lake to Upper Grove Mill. Here you cross the Sorbrook before turning east towards Bloxham Grove, the Bodicote Post Mill and Lower Grove Mill Reservoir. You then turn north along the Austin Road to return to the village.",
