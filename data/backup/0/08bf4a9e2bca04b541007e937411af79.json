  "description": "Enjoy a lovely strech of the South West Coast Path from St Ives to Lelant in Cornwall. You can return on the train at the end of the walk from Lelant Saltings Station. The walk runs for a distance of just under 4 miles along a fairly flat, waymarked path. The walk starts on Porthminster Beach next to the train station in St Ives. You then head south to the lovely village of Carbis Bay which overlooks the small bay of the same name. It is bounded to the north by Porthminster Point and to the east by Hawk's Point and contains a popular family beach. There's also the noteworthy Carbis Bay Hotel, on the seafront, which was built in 1894 by Silvanus Trevail. Just behind the village stands the Knill Monument, known locally as 'The Steeple', a 50-foot (15 m) high monument to John Knill, a mayor of nearby St Ives during the 18th-century. You continue east past the interesting rocks at Carrack Gladde. The cliffs between Carrack Gladden headland and Hawks Point to the east are of metamorphosed Devonian slates and rise to 60 metres high. Near here you will also find the beautiful Porth Kidney Sands which sits just to the north of Lelant. This final section has lovely views over the Hayle Estuary. The estuary is also a significant nature reserve with 18,000 birds including many wading birds, gulls and terns. Look out for teal, curlew, little egret and oystercatcher as you make your way along the estuary. The walk finishes at Lelant Saltings railway station. Here you can catch a direct train back to St Ives or you can retrace your steps. It's also possible to turn it into a longer circular walk by heading west to Mennor and picking up the St Michaels Way long distance trail. This leads back through the countryside to Carbis Bay. To extend the walk continue along the South West Coast Path through Hayle and on to the National Trust owned Godrevy Head and the splendid beach at Gwithian .",
