  "description": "This walk visits a wonderful nature reserve in Unst on Shetland. The varied site includes waymarked trails, a fine viewpoint, wonderful cliff tops, moorland, boardwalks and a wide variety of birdlife. You can start off from the car park on the eastern side of the reserve. From here you can pick up a waymarked circular trail heading north towards Hermaness Hill. Here you can enjoy some splendid views to the island of Muckle Flugga. The island includes an automated lighthouse and is often described as the northernmost point of the British Isles, but the smaller islet of Out Stack is actually further north. The route then picks up a coastal, cliff top path which takes you south before turning east to return to the car park. On the way look out for seabirds including great skua, fulmars, gannets, shags, puffins and guillemots.",
