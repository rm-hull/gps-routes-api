Developed between the 1950s and 1980s, Burgess Park emerged from the Abercrombie Plan for open spaces in 1943. It replaced a landscape once dominated by factories, crowded streets, and the Surrey Canal, heavily bombed during World War II. Named after Councillor Jessie Burgess, Camberwell's inaugural female Mayor in 1973, the park underwent a significant \u00a38m renovation, reopening in 2012. This transformation cemented its status as a community hub, celebrated for its heritage, sports amenities, lake, wildlife, design, horticulture, and barbecue facilities."
