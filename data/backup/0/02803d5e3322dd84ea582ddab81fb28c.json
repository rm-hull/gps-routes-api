  "description": "Explore the expansive gardens surrounding this palatial 19th century mansion on this delightful walk in Worcestershire. The grounds contain a spectacular lake, a French parterre and a vast fountain of Perseus and Andromeda carved from Portland stone. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could visit Shrawley Woods. The woods are only a few miles from Witley Court and have miles of good woodland trails, a riverside path along the River Severn and several large ponds to enjoy.",
