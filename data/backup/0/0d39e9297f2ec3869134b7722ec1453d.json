  "description": "Travel from Birds Edge to Mexborough along the River Dearne on this delightful riverside walk through Yorkshire. The footpath begins at Birds Edge, near Holmfirth and heads east through Daton, Barnsley and Bolton Upon Dearne before coming to an end at Mexborough. Walk highlights include the splendid Bretton Country Park near the start of the walk. The country park includes 500 acres of lakes and parkland, housing various sculptures as well as being the home of several endangered species. The fascinating Yorkshire Sculpture Park also sits within the park and is well worth exploring. The only one of its kind, the park is an international centre for modern and contemporary art, which receives thousands of visitors each year. The walk also visits the lovely Dearne Valley park in Barnsley. This riverside park runs along the River Dearne for about two miles and boasts a lake and a variety of wildlife.",
