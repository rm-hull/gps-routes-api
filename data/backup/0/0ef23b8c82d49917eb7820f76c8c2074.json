The waymarked footpath will take you east into Peterborough, passing picturesque countryside and agricultural land on the way. If you follow the Hereward Way south east you will soon come to the Barnack Hills And Holes National Nature Reserve. There's a rather interesting and unusual landscape here with grassy undulating slopes in an ancient medieval quarry. The site is noted for some signficant flora and fauna as well. You can find the reserve on the western side of Barnack village. Postcode for sat navs is PE9 3EU."
