Of the thirteen or so original lakes, most have been filled in with fly ash from Didcot Power Station over the last quarter-century. This is one of just three which remain; there is a current planning application to extend fly ash dumping to this and one other of the remaining lakes, which a local campaign group is opposing"

  "description": "This circular walk explores the Radley Lakes near Abingdon in Oxfordshire. There's some nice footpaths around the picturesque lakes where you can look out for a variety of water loving birds. The route starts from the train station in Radley village. From here you can follow country lanes east to Lower Radley before meeting up with the River Thames. Follow the Thames Path south and it will take you past the lakes towards Abingdon. You then follow footpaths north past Thrupp Lake to return to Radley and the train station.",
