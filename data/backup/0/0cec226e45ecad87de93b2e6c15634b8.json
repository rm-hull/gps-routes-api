  "description": "Follow the River Yare from Bowthorpe to Marston Marsh on this deilghtful riverside walk near Norwich. You start off in Bowthorpe Southern Park, a pleasant local park with ponds, grassland, horses and a car park. The route then runs for a distance of roughly 6 miles, following a flat footpath south east past Bowthorpe Marshes, Colney, Earlham Park and the University of East Anglia. There's some lovely nature trails here, taking you through the university grounds which include a man made broad and a boardwalk. The route then passes Cringleford before finishing on the Ipswich Road in Tuckswood. Here you will find the wildlife rich Marston Marshes, a nature reserve and a nice scenic area to end the walk. To continue your walking through the Yare Valley you could pick up the Wherryman's Way. This longer route takes you east from Norwich, through the Norfolk Broads to the coast at Great Yarmouth. The route also links up with another riverside walk in the shape of the Tas Valley Way around Cringleford.",
