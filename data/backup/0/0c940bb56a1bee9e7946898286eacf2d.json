  "description": "A circular walk taking you along the beautiful Rhossili Bay before a climb to Rhossili Down for wonderful views along the Gower Coast. The first section takes you along the Wales Coast Path from the Rhossili car park to Hillend. It's a fairly flat path running along the stunning Rhossili beach with nice views of the sand dunes and the cliffs. There is a campsite and a cafe at Hillend so it's a good opportunity to grab some refreshments at what is roughly the half way point of the walk. At Hillend you turn around and climb onto Rhossili Down, the highest point in the Gower. It's a beautiful area commanding fabulous views to Worm's Head. You can also see lots of pretty wildflowers on the heathland in the summer months. Look out for ponies and horses grazing on the Down too. At the beacon you will reach the high point of the Gower at 193m (633ft). It is also the site of a Bronze-Age cairn built around four thousand years ago. After taking in the views from the beacon the route descends a short distance back to the car park. To continue your walking in this stunning area you could try our circular walk around the Rhossili headland. At low tide you can also cross the causeway and visit Worm's Head .",
