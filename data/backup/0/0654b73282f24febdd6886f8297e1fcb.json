  "description": "A lovely waterside walk through Dentdale in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The route uses a section of the Dales Way long distance trail to take you from the town of Sedbergh to the village of Dent, about 5 miles to the south east. The valley of the River Dee is a very beautiful and peaceful place, popular with walkers. From Sedbergh you head south from the town centre, crossing the River Rawthey at Millthrop before reaching the Dee at Lenacre. The path runs along the river to the village of Dent where you can enjoy refreshment at the pub before the return leg. To extend the walk you can continue along the Dales Way to the village of Cowgill. This section includes a number of caves and pretty waterfalls. Also just after Dent is the side valley of Deepdale. The dale is accessible by a narrow road which runs from Dent south to Kingsdale and Ingleton. To continue your riverside walking in the area you could try our Sedbergh Circular Walk which will take you along the River Rawthey.",

      "content": "If you head a few miles south you can explore the superb limestone pavement at Hutton Roof Crags and Farleton Fell. Near here there's the remote and pretty village of Barbon where you can try the Barbon Beck Barbondale Walk. The little village includes a noteworthy 17th century pub as well. A few miles to the north there's the nearby village of Tebay where you will find riverside trails along the River Lune. The village is also known for its 16th century pub and the Tebay Motorway Services. The Dales High Way passes through the area. This long distance waymarked trail explores many of the highlights of the Dales, running from Saltaire to Appleby-in-Westmorland for a distance of approximately 90 miles. To the south there's the impressive Dent Head Viaduct and Arten Gill Viaduct to see. The viaducts are located close to each near Dent Station on the Settle\u2013Carlisle line. There's some fine hill climbs and more riverside trails to enjoy in this scenic area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Howgills Walks page."
