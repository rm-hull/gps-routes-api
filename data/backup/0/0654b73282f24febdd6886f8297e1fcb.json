  "description": "A lovely waterside walk through Dentdale in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The route uses a section of the Dales Way long distance trail to take you from the town of Sedbergh to the village of Dent, about 5 miles to the south east. The valley of the River Dee is a very beautiful and peaceful place, popular with walkers. From Sedbergh you head south from the town centre, crossing the River Rawthey at Millthrop before reaching the Dee at Lenacre. The path runs along the river to the village of Dent where you can enjoy refreshment at the pub before the return leg. To extend the walk you can continue along the Dales Way to the village of Cowgill. This section includes a number of caves and pretty waterfalls. Also just after Dent is the side valley of Deepdale. The dale is accessible by a narrow road which runs from Dent south to Kingsdale and Ingleton. To continue your riverside walking in the area you could try our Sedbergh Circular Walk which will take you along the River Rawthey.",
