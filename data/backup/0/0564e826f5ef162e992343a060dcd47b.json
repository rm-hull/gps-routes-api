  "description": "This large area of coniferous woodland on the North York Moors has miles of footpaths and bridleways for walkers and mountain bikers. This route starts from Levisham train station where you can pick up the tracks into the forest. The trails are on nice wide paths with some climbs and fast descents to enjoy. Keep your eyes peeled for deer as you make your way through the woods. The Tabular Hills Walk passes the southern edge of the woods near Levisham. You could pick up this long distance trail and follow it to the nearby natural amphitheatre at the Hole of Horcum and the ancient stones at Bridestones. You could also visit the forest from the nearby village of Hutton-le-Hole by following the trail from there. The forest is located close to the ancient market town of Pickering where you can visit Pickering Castle and enjoy countryside trails along the Pickering Beck.",
