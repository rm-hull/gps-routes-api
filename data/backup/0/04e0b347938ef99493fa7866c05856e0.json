  "description": "This Derbyshire based village is notable as the point where the River Amber joins the River Derwent. It's a great place for waterside walking with the Cromford Canal also running through the area. The village is notable for its railway heritage and for being located at the spot where the River Amber joins the River Derwent. This circular walk starts from the train station and takes you along the canal before visiting the nearby Shining Cliff Woods . From the station you can pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way and follow this waymarked footpath north along the River Derwent and the canal to Whatsandwell. Cross the bridge here and follow a country lane round to Alderwasley Park before coming to the woods. There's miles of peaceful trails with woodland birds and bluebells to see in the springtime. The route then passes the Oakhurst Mills before crossing the bridge and returning to Ambergate.",
