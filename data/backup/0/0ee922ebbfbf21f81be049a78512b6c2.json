  "description": "Enjoy wonderful coastal views on this popular Cliff Walk in the town of Ballybunion, County Kerry. The walk starts from the southern end near Ladies Beach and the Cliff House Hotel. You then follow paths west and north to Nun's Beach at the northern end. Along the way you can enjoy tremendous views over Ballybunion Bay on the atlantic coast. There's some interesting geology on the cliffs with rock formations and murky caves to see. You can also enjoy views of some nice green countryside and farmland. It's also great for wildlife with sea birds on the cliffs and dolphins in the waters below. The fairly flat surfaced path runs for about 1.5km so 3km there and back. You can extend your walk by enjoying an easy stroll along the wide, beautiful beach.",
