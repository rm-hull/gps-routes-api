  "description": "This attractive West Sussex village is located close to Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath. The historic settlement includes a 12th century church and a noteworthy pub which is also several hundred years old. For walkers there are lots of nearby trails on which to explore the surrounding woodland and countryside of the High Weald AONB and the South Downs. This circular walk from the village uses part of the High Weald Landscape Trail and other footpaths to explore the woodland and farmland around Bolney. You'll visit Bolney Wood and Ragget's Wood before returning via Wykehurst Park.",
