  "description": "An easy waterside walk through the city of Dublin along the Grand Canal. The route runs from the Grand Canal Dock to Adamstown where it meets with the long distance Grand Canal Way which takes you all the way to the River Shannon. It's about a 15km (9mile) walk along a flat towpath so nice easy walking. On the way you'll pass a number of pretty locks and the Patrick Kavanagh Statue. The Irish poet and novelist wrote the poem 'Lines written on a Seat on the Grand Canal, Dublin'. The walk starts from the Grand Canal Dock in the city centre of Dublin. The area has undergone significant redevelopment since 2000, being dubbed 'Silicon Docks' and becoming a popular location for high-tech multinationals such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Airbnb. The towpath then heads west passing Portobello, Dolphin's Barn, Inchicore. The path of the original main line, which serviced the Grand Canal Harbour, the City Basin (reservoir) and Guinness brewery, can be seen at Inchicore. The history of the canal is bounded to the brewery as it was used by Guinness at both ends of their process, for raw materials and the product itself. The route continues through Bluebell, and Clondalkin before coming to Adamstown and the Lucan Bridge. Here you can join with the Grand Canal Way which runs for 72 miles to Shannon Harbour. The Grand Canal runs parallel to the Royal Canal just to the north. You can pick up the slightly longer Royal Canal Way at Newcomen Bridge in North Strand.",

The pleasant boardwalk trail passes a number of historic bridges and interesting old buildings in the heart of the city. Head to the coast and you can try the Dun Laoghaire Pier Walk. It's a popular coastal walk taking you along the 19th century pier with splendid sea views and an additional visit to the delightful People's Park. Just north of here you can pick up the Dublin Coastal Walk which takes you along the shared cycling and walking path in Clontarf. The walk additionally visits the lovely St Anne's Park where there's a rose garden, ponds and walks along the Naniken River. Just under an hours drive from the city you'll find the fascinating Hill Of Tara. The ancient site is considered one of the most significant archaeological sites in Ireland."
