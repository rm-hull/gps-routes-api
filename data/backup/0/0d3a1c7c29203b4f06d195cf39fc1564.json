It offers residential moorings, temporary moorings for visitors and narrow boat hire; in addition to boat sales and a full-range of services for boaters. The blue building on the left of the image is a shop, chandlery and administration block."

  "description": "This walk follows a lovely section of the Trent and Mersey Canal from Burton Upon Trent to Barton Marina in the the nearby village of Barton under Needwood. On the way you'll pass Branston Water Park where there's a series of lakes and lots of wildlife to look out for. There's also pretty locks and nice open views over the surrounding Staffordshire countryside. You start in Shobnall and follow the canal south through Branston before finishing at Barton Turns Marina. The route follows a section of the long distance Way for the Millennium. You can extend the walk by continuing along the canal to Alrewas where you follow the River Swarbourn through Wychnor Park.",
