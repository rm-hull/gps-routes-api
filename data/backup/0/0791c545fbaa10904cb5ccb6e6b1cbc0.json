  "description": "Explore the Albury Estate on this pleasant walk in Surrey. There's 150 acres of parkland with lots of walking trails to try. Features include peaceful woodland, pretty lakes and the River Tillingbourne. There is also the Grade II listed Albury country house and the Saxon Old St Peter and St Paul's Church to see. The walk starts from the Grade I listed church and follows footpaths through woodland and parkland to the nearby village of Shere. Here you will find a Norman church, old village houses and a tea room for refreshments. The walk then follows the Fox Way and other footpaths to return you to Albury. If you'd like to extend your walk then you could continue along the Fox Way to the nearby Blackheath Common. The tranquil Silent Pool is also nearby. Our 9 mile circular walk from Shere visits the park and also heads to the popular viewpoints at St Martha's Hill and Newlands Corner .",

It's an impressive sight with a number of buildings to explore and informations boards detailing the history of the area. You can access the trail on Blacksmith Lane at a postcode of GU4 8NQ.
