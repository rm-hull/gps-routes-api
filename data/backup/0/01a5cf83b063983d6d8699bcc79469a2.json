  "description": "Enjoy fine views of The Wash on this circular walk from the Norfolk village of Heacham. The route runs for just over 3 miles so should suit most abilites. The attractive beaches in the village are a popular tourist spot in the summer months. They are among the few beaches in eastern England where the sun sets over the sea instead of over the land. You can start the walk from the public car park on the sea front, just to the west of the village at South Beach. From here you can pick up a coastal path running north along Stubborn Sands towards Hunstanton . You can then pick up another inland path, running along the golf course to bring you back towards Heacham. PE31 7LH",
