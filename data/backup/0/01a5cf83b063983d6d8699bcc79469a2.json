  "description": "Enjoy fine views of The Wash on this circular walk from the Norfolk village of Heacham. The route runs for just over 3 miles so should suit most abilites. The attractive beaches in the village are a popular tourist spot in the summer months. They are among the few beaches in eastern England where the sun sets over the sea instead of over the land. You can start the walk from the public car park on the sea front, just to the west of the village at South Beach. From here you can pick up a coastal path running north along Stubborn Sands towards Hunstanton. You can then pick up another inland path, running along the golf course to bring you back towards Heacham. PE31 7LH",

The West Norfolk is also decent pub located a short walk from the beach.. They do good food and have an outdoor area if the weather is nice. You can find the pub at 91 Station Road with a postcode of PE31 7AW for your sat navs."

      "content": "Just to the south you can pick up the Snettisham Walk and visit the splendid RSPB Nature Reserve. Continue north and you can try the Hunstanton Walk. This takes you along a section of the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path National Trail. The route takes you along the waymarked trail to the nearby village of Thornham, passing beaches, sand dunes and nature reserves on the way. If you head east from the route you can visit Heacham village. Here you'll find a noteworthy Norman church dating from 1230. In the cupola on the tower hangs a bell dating from about 1100, making it the oldest in East Anglia, and the seventh oldest in the country. The Holkham National Nature Reserve, Wolferton village, Dersingham Bog, Sandringham Country Park and the Walsingham Way at the medieval Walsingham Abbey are also nearby. All have some good walking trails with more lovely scenery to enjoy. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Walks page."
