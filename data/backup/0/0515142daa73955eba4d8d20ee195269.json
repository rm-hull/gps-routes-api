  "description": "This challenging walk takes you to Bleaklow Head and Bleaklow Stones near Glossop, in the Peak District National Park. The elevated largely peat covered, gritstone moorland, is popular with walkers. The walk starts from the car park at Torside Reservoir and follows the Longdendale Trail along the water before picking up the Pennine Way to Torside Clough. The climb continues past Sykes Moor to the 633 m (2,077 ft) summit of Bleaklow Head. Here you will find a huge cairn of stones and wonderful views across Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Cheshire and the Hope Valley. Holme Moss transmitter, Emley Moor and the Yorkshire Dales are also visible. Footpaths continue east to the interesting geological formations at Bleaklow Stones.An alternative route is to go via Wildboar Clough and its lovely waterfalls although this does require some scrambling. This is shown in the video below. Just to the south of the hill you will find the crash site of the USAF Boeing RB-29A Superfortress at Higher Shelf Stones. Much of the wreckage and a memorial to those who lost their lives can be visited on the Peak District Aircraft Wrecks Walk from Glossop.",
