  "description": "This walk explores the historic Castle Archdale Country Park estate on the shores of Lough Erne in County Fermanagh. On the estate you can follow footpaths through peaceful woodland and along the beautiful lake shore of Lough Erne. There's some lovely views across the water to several of the lough's small islands. Other features include an insect garden, a rock garden and a colourful wildflower meadow. The site also includes a fascinating museum which provides an insight into the historical significance of Castle Archdale during the war. The exhibition showcases various artifacts, such as airplane parts, fuel tanks and archival documents. Notably the lough held a crucial position as the westernmost flying-boat station, where aircraft safeguarded Allied convoys from U-Boat dangers in the North Atlantic. The park is located just to the west of the village of Lisnarick.",
