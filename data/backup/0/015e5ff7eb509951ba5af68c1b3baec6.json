  "description": "This is the popular Skiddaw circular walk from Keswick in the Lake District National Park. It's a challenging route, running for almost 13 miles, and reaching a height of over 3000ft at the high points. Skiddaw is the 4th highest mountain in England and is a popular climb with hill walkers. This route makes use of the Allerdale Ramble way-marked walking trail so is well defined and easy to follow. The route starts from the town of Keswick at the northern end of the beautiful Derwent Water . From here you can pick up the Allerdale Ramble and head north east to Ormathwaite, Applethwaite and Millbeck where there are some pretty waterfalls. The path then heads to Carl Side before the final steep climb to the summit of Skiddaw which stands at a height of 931\u00a0m (3,054\u00a0ft). Here you will find several cairns\u00a0and a number of stone windshelters. The views are magnificent - you can see\u00a0the\u00a0Cheviots, North Pennines, Yorkshire Dales, Forest of Bowland, the Isle of Arran , the Isle of Man and the Mourne Mountains of Northern Ireland on a clear day. After taking in the views you then descend to Longside Edge and Ullock Pike before a woodland stretch through Thornthwaite Forest takes you to the River Derwent. You then follow the lovely riverside path back into Keswick. The walk can be extended by heading into Dodd Wood near Millbeck. The Allerdale Ramble passes through the wood where you can climb to Dodd Fell summit for great views over Bassenthwaite Lake.",
