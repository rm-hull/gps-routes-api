  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside surrounding the riverside Oxfordshire town of Wallingford. The route makes use of three of the long distance trails which pass through the area. You'll follow sections of the Thames Path the The Ridgeway and The Swan's Way as you make your way through the beautiful Chiltern's countryside which surrounds the town. The route reaches high points of nearly 700ft so there are some moderate climbs with wonderful views to enjoy. The town itself is also a gem of the county and well worth exploring. There's a fine musuem and a Town Hall with a 15th-century town seal and portraits by Thomas Gainsborough. There's also the fascinating ruins of the 11th century Wallingford Castle. The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, two sections of castle wall and the motte hill, are now open to the public. The walk starts from Wallingford Bridge over the River Thames. The route crosses the bridge and then turns south towards Newnham Farm. Cross the A4130 carefully and then pick up the Ridgeway and head east towards Nuffield. Here the walk turns north, heading towards Ewelme Park and Swyncombe. Here you turn west, passing along Ladies Walk where you pick up The Swan's Way. This takes you across the attractive Ewelme Downs to the Ridgeway. You follow the path west back to the river, where you enjoy a final waterside stretch along the Thames, taking you back into the town. To extend your walking in the area you can continue north along the river to Shillingford and Dorchester. Heading south will take you to Goring and Streatley.",
