  "description": "Explore the stunning gardens surrounding this 13th century stately home in Pembrokeshire. There's well laid out footpaths taking you through 40 acres of gardens with some woodland trails to try too. Highlights include rhododendrons, peaceful woodlands, an exotic jungle garden and a pretty walled garden. There also two nice ponds with fish, frogs, eels and dragonflies to look out for. It's great for families with an adventure playground, jungle boardwalk and maze. If you feel like extending your walk you could visit the nearby Slebech Park Estate where you will find miles of woodland trails. Canaston Woods is also nearby and has miles of good cycling and walking trails to try. Just to the east there's the historic Blackpool Mill where there's some fine trails along the River Cleddau to try. The town of Haverfordwest is also nearby. Here you could explore the ruins of the 12th century priory and enjoy more river trails.",
