  "description": "This pretty village sits close to the Fal Estuary in the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The village lies just to the north of the larger settlements of Falmouth and Penryn . This circular walk from the village takes you along the coastal path to Mylor Creek, Greatwood Quay and the Restronguet Creek. On the walk there's lovely waterside paths with lots of boats, weirs and attractive countryside to see along the way. The walk starts in the village and heads south along Mylor Creek, passing Trelew and Mylor Churchtown on the opposite side of the water. You continue round to Greatwood Quay and Restronguet Passage where there is a quay and the splendid Pandora Inn. Here you pick up footpaths along Restronguet Creek towards Halwyn where you turn inland to Angarrick. From here you head south to return to the village.",
