  "description": "This walk explores a lovely area of ancient woodland in Kent. You can start the walk from the good sized Perry Wood car park at the northern end of the site, off Beeches Road. Then pick up the trails heading south to Conduit Wood and the excellent Pulpit viewpoint at the southern end of the woods. From this elevated spot there are some splendid views over the Kent Downs. The area consists of attractive broadleaved woodland, heathland with lots of interesting wildlife to look out for too. Keep your eyes peeled for badgers, foxes, wood mice, dormice, lizards and a variety of woodland birds. In the spring months the daffodils and bluebells bring some colour to the area too. Some of the bridleways at the site are also suitable for cyclists. The woods are located just to the west of the Stour at Chilham and not far from the Kent coast at Faversham. The little village of Shottenden lies on the southern edge.",

A few miles to the south west there's miles of walking and cycling trails in King's Wood. The woods are also home to a fine sculpture trail, bluebells in the spring and wildlife including deer and green woodpeckers. For more walking ideas in the area see the Kent Downs Walks page."
