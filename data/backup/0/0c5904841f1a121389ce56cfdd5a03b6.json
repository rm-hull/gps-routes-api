  "description": "This walk visits the Swinside Stone Circle north of Millom in Cumbria. You can follow a track north west from Cragg Hall for about a mile to reach this mysterious, ancient site. There is some limited parking at the start of the track. It's a very pleasant trail with fine views of the surrounding Lakeland hills and countryside. The site was constructed as a part of a megalithic tradition that lasted from 3,300 to 900 BC. It was built from local slate, with the ring consisting of 55 stones and having a diameter of about 93 ft (26m). It's a beautiful, remote spot with the Lake District mountains making a fine backdrop to the atmospheric stones. The circle sits just to the east of Black Combe Hill where you can enjoy fine views over the countryside and coast.",
