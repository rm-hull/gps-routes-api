  "description": "This route follows the West Highland Way from Inversnaid to Tyndrum via Crianlarich and Glen Falloch. It's just over 17 miles, following the waymarked trail from the hotel at Inversnaid to Tyndrum. You'll start with a waterside section along Loch Lomond before coming to Inverarnan. The route then follows the River Falloch through Glen Falloch where you can enjoy a visit to the picturesque Falls of Falloch. The final section runs from Crianlarich to Tyndrum, passing through woodland and crossing the River Fillan on the way. You can continue your walking on the next section of the trail on the Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy Walk. For the previous section see the Rowardennan to Inversnaid Walk page.",
