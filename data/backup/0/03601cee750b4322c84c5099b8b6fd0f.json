The property was acquired by the National Trust in 1994 and almost \u00a31 million pounds has been spent on restoring the house and outbuildings to create a residential and activity centre."

  "description": "This walk takes you to a historic site on the Glaslyn river in the Snowdonia National Park. It's a lovely area with river views, waterfalls, attractive woodland and a small hill climb to the ancient ramparts of the fort. It's also signifcant as the area of the legend of the Red Dragon which you see today on the Welsh flag. The route runs for about 2 miles with a moderate climb on the way. As such a reasonable level of fitness is required to reach the hill top. The walk starts in Craflwyn from the Princess of Gwynedd centre where parking is available. It's located just to the north east of the popular village of Beddgelert. From here you can pick up the footpaths east through the woodland to the waterfall. You can then climb up to Dinas Emrys where there are splendid views over Llyn Dinas and Nant Gwynant. After enjoying the views the route returns to the car park on the same paths.",
