  "description": "This walk takes you around the beautiful gardens, woodland and arboretums in the West Dean Estate near Chichester. The gardens are particularly lovely with a Walled Kitchen Garden, a spectacular 300 foot-long Edwardian Pergola, a Spring Garden and a beautiful parkland walk with views over the South Downs. There are also views of the River Lavant and the wonderful West Dean College building. On the eastern side of the site there's also the fascinating Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. The museum boasts '45 historic houses and agricultural buildings dating from the 13th century to victorian times rebuilt in a magnificent parkland setting'. To extend your walking in the area try our West Dean and East Dean Walk. This route takes you between the two villages on the Monarch's Way, passing The Trundle Hillfort on the way.",
