  "description": "This lovely nature reserve has miles of boardwalks and footpaths taking you to fine heathland, ponds, lakes and deciduous woodland. It's one of the finest areas in the country for wildlife with birds including woodlark, Dartford warbler, nightjar, stonechat, whinchat and curlew. Also look out for some very rare butterflies including silver-studded blue, white-letter hairstreak and purple emperor.  In the heathland area you may see reptiles such as the rare sand lizard and smooth snake.  Rare dragonfly and damselfly can be spotted around the pools and lakes. In the fen and open water area you can see various water loving birds such as  great crested grebe, mute swan, coot, water rail and little grebe. Finally in the woodland area you can see woodpeckers, woodcock, redstart, tawny owl, nightingale and hawfinch. This circular walk starts at the Moat car park and takes you across Thursley Common to Silkmill Pond and Warren Mere. You then head across Ockley Common and pass Pudmore Pond before returning to the car park. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Frensham Country Park where there are miles of cycling and walking trails. The Devil's Punch Bowl and Gibbet Hill is also a great option with more cycling and walking trails through a natural nature reserve, filled with heathland, streams and woodland. The Greensand Way long distance footpath also runs through the common so you could pick this up to continue your walk.",
