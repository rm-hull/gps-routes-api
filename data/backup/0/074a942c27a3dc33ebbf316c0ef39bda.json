  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Sgwd Yr Eira waterfall from Pontneddfechan\u00a0in the heart of Waterfall Country. It's about a 2.5 mile walk to the falls from the village, passing through woodland on a series of footpaths with some moderate climbs on the way. The falls are one of the most spectacular in the area, located on the Afon Hepste in a steep rocky ravine. You can even walk behind the waterfall for a wonderful view of the blanket of rushing water. The walk starts in the village and follows the Afon Mellte north east into the wooded gorge. You soon come to the Craig-y-Ddinas car park which is an alternative start point for the walk. Here you can branch of to the south and visit the lovely Afon Sychryd where there are two waterfalls to see. There's also the Dinas Rock, a high promontory of\u00a0Carboniferous Limestone\u00a0which rises between the\u00a0Afon Mellte\u00a0and the\u00a0Afon Sychryd. The route continues along the river, passing footbridges and weirs before coming to Sgwd yr Eira. The name translates as 'fall of snow' and includes a footpath running behind the water. It's a wonderful sight and one of the highlights of the Brecon Beacons National Park. You can extend the walk by visiting the other falls in the area on the Four Waterfalls Walk . Our longer Neath Waterfalls Walk will take you on a tour of the area, visiting some of the falls to the north of the village.",
