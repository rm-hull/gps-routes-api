      "caption": "Pond in the park. Dunorlan Park was once the private grounds of a large and very grand mansion owned by the Yorkshire-born millionaire, Henry Reed. The garden was laid out in the 1850s and 1860s by the renowned Victorian gardener Robert Marnock. Although the mansion no longer exists, the garden is one of the best preserved examples of Marnock's work. Dunorlan Park is now an historically important and much-loved public park. The Heritage Lottery Fund award of \u00a32.1 million has enabled the restoration of Dunorlan's historic features and improved access into and around the park. The park contains a number of amenities including a cafe, boating lake, putting green, car parks, toilets, as well as rolling Wealden countryside."

  "description": "This large park in Royal Tunbridge Wells covers nearly 80 acres with some nice walking trails to try. It's located on the eastern edge of the town and a great place for a short stroll. There's lovely wide lawns, waterside paths along the large lake, attractive woodland and a Grecian Temple containing the Dancing Girl Statue. There's also a cascade, a Victorian water garden, ponds and a very fine fountain with dolphins, water nymphs and classical figures. The park's location also provides wonderful views of the surrounding countryside of the Weald. If you'd like to extend your walk you can pick up the Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk and follow it west to the delightful Tunbridge Wells Common. On the common you'll find miles of walking trails taking you to woodland, heathland and ponds with a variety of wildlife to look out for.",

      "content": "There's a nice cafe in the park for refreshments after your exercise. You can sit outside on the balcony and enjoy fine views of the park with your lunch. The Barn pub in Tunbridge Wells is another worthy option and an establishment of some note. It has an interesting history having been reconstructed from a centuries old Elizabethan Barn which was originally built in a nearby Kent village and re-erected on its present site. Recreated in the original Kentish style with oak beams and columns throughout it has an interior full of character. Outside there is a delightful award winning courtyard garden. Heated for cooler days and beautifully illuminated at night, it's really very pretty and a lovely place to relax with refreshments after your exercise. You can find the pub in the town centre at 1 Lonsdale Gardens, Mount Pleasant Road with a postcode of TN1 1NU for your sat navs."
