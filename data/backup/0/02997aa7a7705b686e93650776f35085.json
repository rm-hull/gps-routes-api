  "description": "This circular walk visits Cant Clough Reservoir in the South Pennines. The small reservoir is in a remote location making it a peaceful place for a walk. The walk starts from the car park at Hurstwood and follows the Pennine Bridleway to Hurstwood Reservoir. You continue east along the waymarked trail and you will soon come to Cant Clough. You can follow footpaths along the water before looping around through the moorland to return to the car park.",
