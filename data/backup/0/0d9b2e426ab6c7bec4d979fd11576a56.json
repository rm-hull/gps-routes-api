  "description": "This pretty Worcestershire based village is notable for a number of historic timber framed properties. It's also great for walkers with nearby canal trails, riverside paths, woodland areas and an old country estate to explore on foot. Ombersley is located between Worcester and Stourport. This circular walk from the village visits some of the local walking highlights including Westwood House Park, the Droitwich Canal and the River Severn. Much of the route makes uses of the Wychavon Way, a long distance footpath running through the area. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Wychavon Way and follow the waymarked footpath east to Hadley and Westwood Park. The 17th century house is surrounded by some lovely parkland with woodland and a lake. You can follow public footpaths around the Great Pool and then continue south to cross the River Salwarpe at Salwarpe. Here you pick up the Droitwich Canal and follow the waterside path south west to Porter's Mill. Leave the canal here and follow country lanes north west to Chatley and Bournes Dingle. Around here you can then pick up a riverside footpath heading along the River Severn towards Holt Fleet. Turn east and the final section will take you through Ombersley Park, passing the fish ponds before returning to the village.",
