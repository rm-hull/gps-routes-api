  "description": "This walk climbs to Beamsley Beacon from the town of Ilkley in Nidderdale. It's about a 4.5 mile walk to the hill top, so about 9 miles in total. It's a lovely area with views of the Nidderdale countryside, some short woodland sections and a riverside footpath to enjoy. The walk starts on Ilkley Bridge over the River Wharfe in Ilkley. Cross to the north side of the river and then follow a waterside footpath west toward Ilkley Golf Club. The route continues north west through Owler Park to Nesfield before coming to West Hall. Here you turn north east to follow the West Hall Beck to Black Foss Farm. A mixture of country lanes and footpaths then take you up to the summit of Beamsley Beacon. The summit stands at a height of 326 metres (1,070 ft) and includes a number of  stone cairns, dating from the Bronze Age. From the peak there are splendid views over the surrounding hills and countryside including the nearby Chelker Reservoir. After taking in the views the route then descends back to the town on the same paths. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the long distance Dales Way and pay a visit to the splendid Bolton Abbey .",
