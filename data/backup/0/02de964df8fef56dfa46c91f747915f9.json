  "description": "Explore 250 acres of peaceful woods and lakes at Tehidy, near Portreath, in Cornwall. There are a number of easy walking and cycling paths running through the park. There is also an abundance of wildlife with swans, geese, rooks, jackdaws, coots, moor hens, grey squirrels, otters, and badgers. This circular route begins and ends at the parking area at the eastern end of the park but Camborne rail station is only about 2 miles away so is a good option for cyclists. The path is also very near to the coast at Portreath so the walk can be extended in order to see the delightful coves and beaches in the area. To continue your walking in this beautiful area you could pick up the South West Coast Path and head to Godrevy Head. The stretch of coast is managed by the National Trust so there are good footpaths and facilities along the way. This area also includes the splendid beach and sand dunes at the splendid beach at Gwithian .",

You could head to the coast at Portreath and pick up the popular Mineral Tramways Trail. It will take you to Devoran along a shared cycling and walking trail, passing some of Cornwall's historic mine buildings on the way. The Portreath Walk passes the park as it makes its way along the coast to visit the stunning Hayle Estuary. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
