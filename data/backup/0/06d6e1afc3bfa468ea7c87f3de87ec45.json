  "description": "This circular walk takes you to Winchelsea Beach from the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve in Sussex. You can start the walk from the nature reserve car park next to the Martello Tower. From here follow footpaths south west past Nook Beach to Winchelsea Beach. From the top of the sea well there are fine views over to Dungeness to the east and Fairlight to the west. The walk then follows the beach north east along Rye Bay to the entrance to the River Rother where there are nice view across to the popular beach at Camber Sands on the other side. You can then follow the riverside footpaths north back to the car park. On the way will pass a series of pretty lagoons where you can look out for a wide variety of wildlife.",
