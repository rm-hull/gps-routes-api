  "description": "A popular walk along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path from Tenby to the neighbouring village of Saundersfoot. There's much to enjoy with exhilarating cliff top paths, beautiful beaches, woodland sections and fabulous coastal views. It's about a 5 mile walk on an undulating path, so a reasonable level of fitness is required. The walk starts on the front in Tenby and takes you past Paragon Beach, Castle Beach and St Catherine's Island. The island is reachable at low tide and contains St Catherine's Fort, a Grade II listed 19th century Palmerston Fort. There's lovely views across to the island on the opening section of the walk. The coastal path then takes you past the medieval Tenby Castle. The ruined fortification dates from the 13th century and includes a circular walk following the line of the original curtain walls. It is also home to Tenby Museum & Art Gallery. After exploring the castle the route heads north along the coast path to Monkstone Beach, passing Lodge Valley woodland on the way. You can visit the secluded beach on some steep steps. It's a peaceful place to escape the crowds. After rounding Monkstone Point the walk continues north through Rhode Wood before coming into Saundersfoot. The village is a very popular destination with its lovely harbour and wide blue flag beach. The train station is a little way out of the town. You can follow a country lane to the station and catch a train directly back to Tenby if you like. There's also regular buses from the village. If you would like to extend the walk you can continue along the coast path to Amroth. Here you can visit the National Trust's Amroth and Colby Woodland Garden. You can pick up the long distance Knights Way in Amroth and follow it north to the gardens. If you head in the other direction you can visit the beautiful Lydstep Haven on the Tenby to Lydstep Walk .",
