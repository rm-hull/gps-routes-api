  "description": "This pretty village is located on the west coast of Pembrokeshire at the southern end of St Brides Bay. This walk takes you along a section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to St Brides Haven. You can start the walk in the car park in the village and then follow the waymarked footpath west along the cliff top path for a distance of just under 5 miles. On the way you will pass Musselwick, Strawberry Hill, Goultrop Roads, Borough Head, Mill Haven and Tiklas Point before coming to St Brides Haven. There's splendid sea views to enjoy from the elevated path. At St Brides Haven you'll find a delightful secluded beach, rock pools and the 19th-century St Brides Castle. To continue your walking in the area try the Broad Haven Walk which will take you north along the coast path to the splendidly positioned Druidston Hotel.",
