  "description": "This village is located on the beautiful Wirral Peninsula in Merseyside. Irby is located right next to Royden Park and Thurstaston Common and Coast where you can enjoy miles of good footpaths. There's peaceful woodland, heathland and an excellent viewpoint on top of Thurstaston Hill. Here you can enjoy fine views to the River Dee estuary and look out for a variety of wildlife. From the village head west across the National Trust's Irby Heath and it will take you to the park and the common. The heath is a nice place for a walk in the village with mature trees, ponds and wildlife. You can then head south to the coast and explore the Wirral Country Park on the Wirral Way. The park includes 60 foot high cliffs and good facilties with a visitor centre and cafe. You can also look out for lots of birdlife on the Dee Estuary.",

      "content": "The Irby Mill pub is set in the old miller's cottage for the mill that once stood on this site. After being disused since about 1878 and in a very dilapidated condition, the mill was demolished in 1898. The pub has a charming interior with thick sandstone walls, low beams and a real fire. There's a small L-shaped, stone-floored bar and a lounge used mainly by diners. They serve good quality locally sourced home-made food and have a nice garden area for warmer days. You can find the pub at postcode CH49 3NT for your sat navs. They are dog friendly."
