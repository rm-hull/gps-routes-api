  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Wales coast path from Rhossili to Port Eynon on the Gower. The route runs for just under 7 miles along a lovely cliff top path with fine sea views throughout. It's a particularly photogoenic area with some wonderful limestone rock formations and beautiful bays to observe. The walk starts from the visitor centre car park at Rhossili. From here you can pick up the coastal footpath and start by following it around the headland to Kitchen Corner and Tears Point. The route then heads east along Mewslade Bay to Thurba, Horse Cliff and Overton Cliff before coming to the headland at Port Eynon.",

It's though that the nearby village church was used as a hiding place for contraband around the time of the battle of Trafalgar, with kegs hidden in the altar and sometimes buried in the sand-dunes. They do excellent food and also have a lovely sun trap garden area for warmer days. You can find the inn at a postcode of SA3 1NN for your sat navs."
