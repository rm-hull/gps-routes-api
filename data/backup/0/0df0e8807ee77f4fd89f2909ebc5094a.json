Robert Stephen Hawker was vicar of Morwenstow from 1834 until his death in 1875. He was one of the best minor poets of the Victorian age, particularly as a ballad writer, e.g. 'The Song of the Western Men'. The 'Well of St. Morwenna' was also built by Hawker."

  "description": "This walk explores the National Trust's Morwenstow on the Cornish coast near Bude . The area is great for cliff tops walks with some wonderful sea views to enjoy. There's also an interesting history with a thousand year old church, the 14th century farm and the driftwood built Hawker's Hut. This circular walk starts at the car park near the to farm and takes you past the church to Henna Cliff. You can then follow a section of the South West Coast Path along the cliffs, heading south past Hawker's Hut and Cotton Beach. At Tidna Shute you head inland along The Tidna, before turning north to return to the car park. If you'd like to extend the walk you could continue north along the coast path to the Welcombe and Marsland Valleys Nature Reserve and Hartland Quay in Devon. There's some wonderful rock formations, picturesque waterfalls, lots of sea birds and fine views to Lundy Island from here. Heading south will take you to Bude where you can enjoy a stroll along the Bude Canal or visit the wildlife rich Bude Marshes .",
