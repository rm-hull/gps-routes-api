  "description": "A short circular walk around the pretty Northumberland village of Mitford visiting the remains of the old castle. The little village is located just to the west of Morpeth. From the village you can pick up country lanes and footpaths to take you over the River Wansbeck and then around the old castle. The Grade I listed castle dates from the 11th century and sits on a small hill above the River Wansbeck in the village. It's a photogenic spot and a nice place for a stroll with the Norman motte and bailey castle surrounded by pleasant countryside and woodland. From the elevated position of the ruins there are fine views of Northumberland to enjoy. You can then enjoy a stroll around the village itself where you can see the confluence of the River Wansbeck and the River Font.",
