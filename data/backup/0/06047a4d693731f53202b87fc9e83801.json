  "description": "This estate village is located in the beautiful Derbyshire Dales just south of Ashbourne. It's an attractive place with a pretty village pond, historic church, quaint thatched cottages and some lovely trails through the Osmaston Hall Park Estate. There's also a splendid 18th century pub to relax in after your exercise. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Bonnie Prince Charlie Walk and the Centenary Way to explore the park and visit the neighbouring village of Shirley. On the way you will follow waymarked paths around the estate which includes scenic lakes and peaceful woodland trails.",
