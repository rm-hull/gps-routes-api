  "description": "This Suffolk based town lies just to the east of Bury St Edmunds. Thurston includes a church with medieval features, two pubs and a mock tudor hotel for accommodation. Neighbouring settlements include Pakenham, Tostock and Great Barton. The Rougham Estate and Barton Mere are also close at hand. This walk from the village takes you west along a shared cycle and walking route to Battlies Green and then into Bury St Edmunds. It's a nice, flat, traffic free path that will take you into the heart of the town before finishing at the historic abbey with its beautiful gardens. In the town you can also pick up the St Edmund Way and Bury to Clare Walk, long distance footpaths. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Thurston. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
