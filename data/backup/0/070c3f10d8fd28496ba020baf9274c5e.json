  "description": "This West Midlands village is located in the Solihull area of the county. Meriden is thought to be the geographical centre of England. There is a stone cross in the village commemorating the claim. This circular walk takes you around the village, visiting some of the historical highlights. This includes the 15th-century Moat House, the 18th century Manor House Hotel and the old church. There's also a picturesque village pond and some fine views of the surrounding farmland to enjoy. The Coventry Way and the Heart of England Way pass through the eastern side of the village. These long distance footpaths are a fine way of exploring the surrounding countryside. You could follow the waymarked trail south to visit neighbouring Berkswell which includes a Norman church, a Grade II listed 16th century inn and the Berkswell Windmill which dates back to 1826. The Coventry Way and the Warwickshire Millennium Way can also be picked up around here.",
