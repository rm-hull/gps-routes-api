  "description": "This circular walk around the Kent town of Sevenoaks visits some of the highlights of the area. The route runs for a distance of about 10 miles, making use of the Greensand Way and other public footpaths to visit Ightham Mote and Knole Park. The walk starts from the train station where you can pick up the Greensand Way and follow it south east into Knole Park. The grounds of the park are delightful with about 500 resident deer, ancient woodland, dry heathland, acid grassland and wood pasture. Knole house contains a world class collection of furniture and textiles from royal palaces and is also well worth exploring. The route heads through the park to Carter's Hill and One Tree Hill before coming to Ightham Mote. The fine medieval moated manor house includes three way-marked walks taking you around the gardens and into the wider estate. The 14 acre gardens are a delight with an 18th-century cascade, orchard and an enclosed garden with a fountain. There's also pleasure grounds with a meandering stream, ornamental lake and specimen trees. After exploring Ightham Mote the route heads west through Broadhoath Woods, Great Roger's Wood and Godden Green before returning to Knole Park through Godden Wood. The route then picks up the Greensand Way again to return you to the train station. To extend your walking in the area try our other walk around Sevenoaks which visits the lovely Sevenoaks Wildlife Reserve and the pretty Chipstead Lake .",
