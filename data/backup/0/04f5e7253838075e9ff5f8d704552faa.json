  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this large country park in Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf. There are 500 acres of woodlands, pasture and moorland mountainside to explore on a number of different waymarked trails. There's some climbing involved but you are rewarded with some truly fabulous views of the surrounding countryside and mountains. The Coed Morgannwg Way runs past the park so you could follow this trail if you'd like to continue your walk. You could follow the trail west to visit Twyn y Bloedd, the Lluest Wen Reservoir and Rhigos Mountain. Here you'll find a splendid viewpoint with views over the Vale of Neath and the Cynon Valley.",
