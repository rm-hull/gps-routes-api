  "description": "This woodland and nature reserve in Croydon is criss crossed with a number of nice footpaths and walking trails. The reserve includes 200 acres of ponds, open meadows and ancient woodland including oak, beech, ash and sweet chestnut. There's two colour coded waymarked trails which you can pick up from the car park. The area is also known as the Bird Sanctuary with birds such as Blackcap, Buzzard, Cuckoo and Chiffchaff to look out for. Also keep your eyes peeled for Roe Deer, various insects and the rare White Squirrel. It's great for flora too with 130 flowering plants to see. These include Crocus, Red Campion, Bluebell and Cowslip. The London Loop and the Vanguard Way pass through the wood so you can pick these long distance footpaths up and extend your walk. One option is to follow the trails north to Littleheath Woods and then on to Addington Hills. This lovely park includes London's largest area of heathland and a great viewpoint with views towards Parliament Hill and Docklands. Just to the west of Addington Hills is Croham Hurst Woods where you'll find ancient woodland and a climb to Breackneck Hill. Heading east from Selsdon Wood will take you to Frith Wood and Frylands Wood. Heading south will take you into Surrey, passing Greatpark Wood, Holt Wood and Chelsham. For cyclists National Cycle Route 21 passes close to the woods at New Addington.",
