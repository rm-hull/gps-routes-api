  "description": "The town of Wivenhoe is located just south of Colchester on the River Colne in Essex. There's some lovely riverside walks and the town centre is also worth exploring on foot. It's a designated conservation area, with lots of buildings of some architectural significance. This walk or cycle follows the Wivenhoe Trail along the river from Wivenhoe to Colchester. The trail runs for about 2.5 miles along a flat footpath with train stations at either end. There's great views of the surrounding countryside and a number of sculptures along the way, each one representing part of the history of the area. The walk starts from the train station where you can pick up the Wivenhoe Trail and follow it north west along the river past Wivenhoe Wood. The trail passes the University of Essex before coming to the outskirts of Colchester at Hythe. Here you can catch the train back from Hythe Station or return along the same path. You can head in the other direction along the river on the Wivenhoe to Brightlingsea. This starts in Wivenhoe and heads south to Alresford Creek and the Colne Estuary National Nature Reserve in Brightlingsea .",
