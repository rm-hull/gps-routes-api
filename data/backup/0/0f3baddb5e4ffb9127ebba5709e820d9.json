  "description": "A new walking route running through the pastoral countryside near the Welsh-English border. The trail runs from Llanymynech in Powys to Holywell in Flintshire following Wat's Dyke - a 40-mile earthwork. On the route: Montgomery Canal - the walk follows the canal from the start at Llanymynech to Maesbury (video below). Oswestry - the next stage takes you to this interesting town with a Celtic Hill Fort. Erbistock - you will cross the River Dee at this pretty village. Wrexham - the walk then heads to the largest town in north Wales, passing the National Trust Property of Erddig Hall just before. Alyn Waters Country Park - the next stage takes you through this lovely park and the villages of Hope and Caergwrle. Holywell - the finish point for the walk, taking its name from the nearby St Winefride's Holy Well, one of the Seven Wonders of Wales. The walk finishes at Basingwerk Abbey - a 12th century Cistercian monastery. The walk is waymarked with a green and white disc.",
