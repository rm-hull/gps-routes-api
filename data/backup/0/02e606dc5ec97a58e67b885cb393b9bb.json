  "description": "This Surrey based village is surrounded by some lovely North Down scenery. It sits right on the edge of Banstead Heath where there are miles of good walking and cycling trails to try. To the north is Epsom Downs where you can enjoy views of the famous Epsom Racecourse. This circular walk starts from the train station and visits these two local highlights using a series of good public footpaths. There's much to enjoy with peaceful woodland trails and moderate hill climbs providing excellent views over the surrounding countryside.",
