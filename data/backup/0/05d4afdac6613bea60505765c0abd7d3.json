It was designed by Napper Architects with Arup and was lowered into place by an RAF helicopter. It is close to the extensive foundations of the Willowford Roman bridge."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the fascinating Birdoswald Roman Fort on the Cumbrian section of Hadrian's Wall. The route first explores the fort before following footpaths to other local highlights including the River Irthing, a Roman Quarry, nearby woodland and the village of Gilsland. The walk starts from the English Heritage car park and visitor centre. The fort is the most impressive of the remaining defences along the Wall today. It dates back to AD 122 and includes a well preserved eastern gate, fort walls and watch towers. There's also a museum with an interactive exhibition which details the history of the fort. After exploring the fort you can pick up the Hadrian's Wall Path and follow the waymarked trail along the wall to Turrets 49b and 50b. Soon after you come to Combcrag Wood and a Roman Quarry. Here you turn south through the woods on a path which runs along the River Irthing to Chapelburn. Here you'll pass another Roman Fort and cross the Irthing before heading east along a country lane to Upper Denton where you'll pass the remains of the old Bastle or fortified farmhouse. The route continues east to bring you into the village of Gilsland. The village is in an interesting spot straddling the border between Cumbria and Northumberland, with most of its houses in Northumberland. From the village you can visit the lovely Crammel Linn waterfall which sits in a wonderful river gorge to the north. After exploring the village the route heads west to cross an old Roman Bridge over the Irthing.  Shortly after you return to Birdoswald where the walk finishes. You can virtually explore the fort on the google street view link below.",
