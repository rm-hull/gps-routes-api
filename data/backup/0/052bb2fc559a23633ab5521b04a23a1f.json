  "description": "This quaint village is located on the Isle Of Wight between Newport and Ventnor in the southeast of the island. It's a delightful place with picturesque thatched cottages and the historic All Saints Church which dates from the medieval period. There's also several lovely tea rooms and an exceptionally detailed Model Village portraying Godshill and Shanklin's old village at a scale of 1:10. This circular walk from the village uses parts of the Worsley Trail , the Stenbury Trail and the Yar River Trail to explore the countryside to the south of the village. On the way you will also visit the historic Appuldurcombe House and enjoy fine views from the elevated spots on Appuldurcombe Down and Stenbury Down. Appuldurcombe House dates from the 18th century and was the seat of the Worsley family. The house is now mainly a shell but has some interesting history and delightful grounds to explore.",
