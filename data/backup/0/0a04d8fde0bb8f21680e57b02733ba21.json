  "description": "This walk visits a large reservoir near the village of Camlough in County Armagh. There is a car parking area at the northern end of the lake. From here you can pick up a pavement footpath running along the northern side of the lake with fine views across the water. There is also a footpath running along the eastern side of the reservoir towards some woodland. You can find the site just to the south west of the village and not far from Newry. To continue your walking in the area you could head east to climb Camlough Mountain where you can enjoy some fine views over the area. Also to the east is Newry where you can pick up another nice waterside trail along the Newry Canal. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Camlough. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
