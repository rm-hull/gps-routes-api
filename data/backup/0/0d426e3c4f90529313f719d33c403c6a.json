  "description": "This circular walk from the village of Pontesbury climbs to Earl's Hill and Pontesford Hill for lovely views over the Shropshire countryside. There's much to enjoy with woodland trails, an Iron Age Hillfort and a variety of flora and fauna in the nature reserve area. Look out for the pretty bluebells in the woodland area during the spring months. In the summer you can see orange tip butterflies fluttering around the many wildflowers. The walk starts off from the centre of Pontesbury and heads east to the wooded area just to the north of the hills. You then follow the trails south to Pontesford Hill and Earl's Hill, which stands at a height of 320m (1049ft). Here you'll find a triangulation pillar, far reaching views over the Shropshire Hills and an Iron Age Hillfort dating from 600BC. After taking in the views you descend south to pick up the Marches Way trail. You can then follow this back through the woods towards the village. To continue your walking in the Pontesbury area you could follow the Marches Way long distance trail east to Lyth Hill Country Park. There's more great views to be found from the elevated position of the park. Around here you can also pick up the waymarked Shropshire Way. The epic trail will take you on a tour of the highlights of this beautiful county. The village is located just a few miles from Shrewsbury. Here you can try our Shrewsbury River Walk and enjoy a visit to Shrewsbury Castle and the lovely Quarry Park.",
