You'll use a section of the popular Lyke Wake Walk which crosses the moor. You can start the walk from the car park off the A171 next to Stony Marl Moor. From here you can pick up the Lyke Wake Walk and follow it west across Fylingdales Moor. There's lovely views across the heather moorland to the surrounding hills.",
