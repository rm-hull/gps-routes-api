  "description": "This cycling and walking route follows the River Roding from Roding Valley station to Ilford in Greater London. It's a nice trail on mainly traffic free paths so it is suitable for anyone looking for an easy cycle ride or pleasant stroll. The route starts at Roding Valley station in Buckhurst Hill just west of Chigwell . The start point is close to the lovely Roding Valley Meadows nature reserve which is well worth a visit. The trail heads south past Woodford, Charlie Brown's Roundabout, Redbridge and Wanstead Park before finishing in Ilford. If you're on foot then Wanstead Park is a great place for a stroll. The river runs past the eastern side of the park which also includes a Heron pond and an Ornamental canal.\u00a0The 140 acre park also has the splendid Chestnut Trail to try. There's lots more to see in the area if you would like to extend your outing. The Epping Forest Centenary Walk can be picked up on Wanstead Flats near the end of the route. Knighton Wood at the start of the route has the circular Rowan Trail to follow through the popular rhododendron wood.",
