  "description": "Visit this fascinating Neolithic long barrow and chamber tomb on this circular walk on the The Ridgeway . The historical site dates from 3460\u20133400 BC and includes a burial chamber consisting of a narrow and partially constricted passage, leading to a pair of small side chambers. It's an interesting and atmospheric place with great views of the surrounding countryside and several walking trails to further explore the area. You can park at the Uffington White Horse car park to start the walk. Head south from the car park along a section of the Lambourn Valley Way to meet with The Ridgeway. You then follow the trail west for about a mile to reach the site. After exploring the site, the route heads south east across Knighton Down, before turning north east across Whit Coombe. Here you pick up the Lambourn Valley Way and turn north, crossing Woolstone Down where there is a disc barrow about 50 feet (15 m) in diameter and two bowl barrows.  Iron Age pottery has been found in the area. The final section takes you across Uffington Down, back to the car park. You can extend your walk by continuing south along the Lambourn Valley Way, crossing the Lambourn Downs before picking up the River Lambourn.",
