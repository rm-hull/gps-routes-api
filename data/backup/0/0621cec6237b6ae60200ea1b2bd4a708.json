  "description": "Visit this fascinating Neolithic long barrow and chamber tomb on this circular walk on the The Ridgeway. The historical site dates from 3460\u20133400 BC and includes a burial chamber consisting of a narrow and partially constricted passage, leading to a pair of small side chambers. It's an interesting and atmospheric place with great views of the surrounding countryside and several walking trails to further explore the area. You can park at the Uffington White Horse car park to start the walk. Head south from the car park along a section of the Lambourn Valley Way to meet with The Ridgeway. You then follow the trail west for about a mile to reach the site. After exploring the site, the route heads south east across Knighton Down, before turning north east across Whit Coombe. Here you pick up the Lambourn Valley Way and turn north, crossing Woolstone Down where there is a disc barrow about 50 feet (15 m) in diameter and two bowl barrows. Iron Age pottery has been found in the area. The final section takes you across Uffington Down, back to the car park. You can extend your walk by continuing south along the Lambourn Valley Way, crossing the Lambourn Downs before picking up the River Lambourn.",

      "content": "After your exercise head north east from the site into the village of Uffington for some post walk refreshments. The Fox & Hounds is a good option with a great menu and a nice outdoor seating area. The Pub has 4 Star B&B accommodation, a beamed bar, and unrivalled views of The Ridgeway and Uffington White Horse. It makes a great base for exploring this lovely area. You can find the pub in the centre of the village on the High Street, with a postcode of SN77RP for your sat navs.The interesting village also has some pretty thatched cottages and a noteworthy old church which dates from the 13th century. It also has strong literary connections as John Betjeman lived there in the 1930's and 40's, during which time he wrote many famous works. JRR Tolkein, while based in Oxford, visited this area, and it is said much of his inspiration for Middle Earth came from the Ridgeway nearby. Just to the west is the village of Ashbury where you could visit The Rose and Crown. The inn includes a charming interior with a cosy fire while outside there's a lovely garden area for warmer weather. You can find them on the High Street at postcode SN6 8NA for your sat navs. The village is also a very pleasant place for a stroll with its quaint thatched cottages and fine old church."
