Pease Hutchinson at their Skerne Iron Works in Darlington, the bridge replaced a short-lived wooden bridge which in turn had replaced the river ferry here. There is a comprehensive history of the bridge here  which includes some old pictures and photos, including some of the original engineering design drawings of the supporting columns. Interestingly Brunel's submitted design for the bridge was rejected. Up until the 1950s it was a toll bridge, and the toll house can be seen at the far left of the picture."

It was a toll bridge until 1903, when motorists decided they were no longer prepared to pay and threw the gates into the river. The bridge has 12 arches of which the middle 6 are over the water, with the middle two navigable. The first bridge over the river here was built out of wood in 1280. The centre of the small metal plaque on the near abutment records the maximum water level reached during the November 1894 flood event."

Beyond the wall to the left is Cookham Moor leading down to the Thames in the distance, marked by the sails on dinghies. On this side to the right is the protected area of the town."

  "description": "This attractive Buckinghamshire based village has some lovely riverside trails and local woodlands to explore. This circular walk from the village takes you along the Thames to Cookham and Maidenhead before heading back through the countryside. You'll also visit Cock Marsh, an area of common land and floodplain owned by the National Trust just to the south of the village. The walk starts at Bourne End train station and heads south west to meet up with the Thames Path . Follow the riverside trail south and it will take you to Cookham and Maidenhead. The route then follows a countryside trail north to return to Bourne End via the Cock Marsh Site of Special Scientific Interest which includes a prehistoric burial mound.",
