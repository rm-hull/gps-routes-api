  "description": "This walk visits a large historic castle in the town of Cahir, County Tipperary. The 12th century fortress sits in an unusual location on an island in the river Suir. You can enjoy a stroll around the castle grounds with views over the river to the town. There's also an excellent audiovisual tour where you can learn all about the castle's fascinating history and wonderful architecture. The photogenic site has been used as a film location on several occasions including Excalibur (1981) and The Tudors (2007). To continue your walking around Cahir head north to visit the Rock Of Cashel. The fascinating site houses Ireland's most remarkable collection of medieval structures. In Cashel you can also visit the photogenic ruins of Hore Abbey which lies just to the west of the Rock. The town can be reached from Cahir by picking up the Tipperary Heritage Way, a waymarked long distance walk following the course of the River Suir through the county.",
