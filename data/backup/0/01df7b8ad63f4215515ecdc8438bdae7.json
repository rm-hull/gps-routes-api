  "description": "This Cheshire based market town has an interesting history and a number of fine local walks to try. There's canalside paths, a local nature reserve, waymarked countryside trails and a fine old hall to explore in the immediate area. This walk from the town takes you along the Trent and Mersey Canal to the nearby Rode Hall . The hall is one of the highlights of the area with a beautiful lake and gardens to see. The walk starts in the pretty Sandbach Park in the town centre. The park is a lovely place for a stroll in the town centre, with woods, ponds, gardens and a nice big green. The route then heads south east to the Sandbach Crosses , one of the historical landmarks of the area. The Saxon stone crosses are located on the cobbled market square in the town centre Sandbach. The photogenic structures are carved with animals and Biblical scenes. You continue south west through the town to Wheelock where you can pick up the canal. Follow it east and it will take you past Malkin's Bank and a series of locks before coming to Thurlwood and Rode Hall . The handsome Georgian country house is surrounded by parkland and gardens. Highlights include a one mile lake and the popular Snowdrop Walks in February. In spring the herbaceous border comes to life, rhododendrons bloom and there are carpets of bluebells to see in the woodland. After exploring the hall the route returns to Sandbach on the same paths.",
