In the park you'll find well maintained footpaths taking you to beautiful gardens, woodland trails and the picturesque Fyvie Loch. The 18th century loch is a great place for wildlife watching with nesting swans, geese and ospreys to look out for. Inside the castle you can learn all about its history and view a fine portrait collection, antiquities, armour and lavish oil paintings. The castle is in the care of the National Trust for Scotland who charge for entry. You can see more details on the link below.",
