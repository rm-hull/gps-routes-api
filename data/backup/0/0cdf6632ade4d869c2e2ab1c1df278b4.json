  "description": "This country park and forest has a number of walking trails and two bridleways for cyclists. Formerly known as Brigstock Country Park, it is located a few miles north east of Kettering. For walkers there are three waymarked trails to enjoy: The Skylark Nature trail is an all abilities trail on good surfaced paths. It takes you around the ponds and woods located next to the car park. The Woodland walk is about a mile long and takes you a little further into the woods on good footpaths. The Fermyn Forest Walk is just over two miles taking you deep into the woodland on a mixture of hard and soft tracks. In the park you will find semi-natural oak and ash woodland, ponds, a visitor centre and cafe. It's a splendid area for wildlife watching - look out for Red kites, bullfinch, hawfinch, nightingales, skylark and green woodpeckers. You may also see badgers, fallow deer and Purple emperor butterflies.",
