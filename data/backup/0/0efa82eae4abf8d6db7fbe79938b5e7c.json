  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around this pretty nature reserve in Winchester. In the reserve you will find wetland with chalk stream, reedbeds and grassland. There are nice boardwalks taking you through the reedbeds and a water vole trail where you can look out for these elusive creatures in the slow moving streams. The area has lots of interesting flora and fauna with fen meadow containing wetland wildflowers such as ragged robin and marsh valerian. Look out for otters and birds including redshank, lapwing, kingfisher and snipe. If you'd like to extend your walking in Winchester then you could climb to St Catherine's Hill for fine views over the town below, the River Itchen and the surrounding countryside of the South Downs. The Itchen Way passes the site so you can pick this up to continue your walk along the river.",
