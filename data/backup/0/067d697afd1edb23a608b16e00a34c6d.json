  "description": "Explore the Forest of Bowland AONB from the Inn at Whitewell on this lovely circular walk. The splendid inn is in a wonderful location next to the River Hodder near the Lancashire town of Clitheroe. It's a great place to stay for walkers with a number of fine footpaths to follow into the surrounding countryside. Starting at the inn you head north toward the noteworthy Dunsop Bridge. The pretty village lies very close to the geographic centre of Great Britain at the confluence of the River Dunsop and the River Hodder. From the village you can pick up a trail heading north along the River Dunsop, with woodland on either side. The path then bends round past Whin Fell to Brennand Farm where you head south through the wonderful Trough of Bowland. The 'Trough' is a particularly scenic area of the AONB with its gorgeous valleys, moorland and wooded areas. Follow the trails south through the scenic area to Sykes Farm where you pick up another waterside trail along the Langdon Brook. This will lead you back to Dunsop Bridge where you can follow the road back to the Inn at Whitewell. To continue your riverside walking from the Inn you could pick up the Hodder Way long distance trail. You can follow the trail to the lovely Stocks Reservoir which is another highlight of the area. Also nearby is the climb to Parlick and Fair Snape Fell where you can enjoy some wonderful views over the area.",
