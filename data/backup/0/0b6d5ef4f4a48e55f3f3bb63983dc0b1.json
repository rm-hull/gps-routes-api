  "description": "This short walk takes you around the county town of Carmarthenshire, visiting some of the local highlights. The walk starts at the train station and crosses the River Towy on the footbridge to reach the northern side of the river. Here you can pick up a riverside footpath heading west to Carmarthen Park. There's some nice footpaths here with features including Wales's first velodrome (cycle track), one of the few early velodromes to survive in working condition. There's also nice wide lawns, an old bandstand and a tea room for refreshments. Near the footbridge you have the option of heading north east to visit Carmarthen Castle. Little remains of the original medieval castle at Carmarthen, but the old Gatehouse still dominates Nott Square. The motte is also accessible to the public. Castle House, within the old walls, is a museum and Tourist Information Centre. There's lots of good options for continuing your walking in the area surrounding the town. To the south there's some fine trails in the coastal Pembrey Country Park and Pembrey Forest. Near here you will also find Kidwelly. Our circular walk in the town visits the pretty quay, the River Gwendraeth and the historic Kidwelly Castle. Head south of the town and you can visit Llansteffan. Here you can enjoy a walk along a lovely stretch of coast and a visit to the historic Llansteffan Castle. Also nearby is the noteworthy town of Laugharne. Here you can visit two major highlights of Carmarthenshire at Laugharne Castle and the Dylan Thomas Boathouse. The castle dates from the 12th century and has a fascinating history. The boathouse is now a museum with lots of interesting exhibits to view.",
