  "description": "This purpose-built rowing lake in Buckinghamshire has a traffic free National Cycle Network trail running past it on one side and the Thames Path on the other. As such you can make a circular walking trail using these two trails or a linear ride from Eton Wick to Dorney Reach if you are on your bike. The lake was used as the rowing venue for the 2012 Olympics in London. It's a lovely area with the riverside path and views across the lake to enjoy. There's also 450 acres of parkland including an Arboretum and Nature Conservation area. Look out for water loving birdlife including the grey heron. You can park at the north western end of the lake just off Court Lane to start your walk. Alternatively you could catch the train to Windsor and then follow the Thames Path to the lake. It's about 1.5 mile walk passing Eton, Eton Wick and Dorney Common. A National Cycle Network Path also runs from the train station to the site. If you would like to extend your exercise then you could visit the nearby Windsor Great Park. The park has miles of cycling and walking trails with woodland, parkland and lakes to enjoy. You could also continue along the Thames Path to Maidenhead which is only a couple of miles to the north. The Jubilee River also runs past Dorney. This river has a great waterside cycling and walking trail running from Maidenhead to Eton. You can virtually explore the cycle path on the northern side of the lake using the google street view link below.",
