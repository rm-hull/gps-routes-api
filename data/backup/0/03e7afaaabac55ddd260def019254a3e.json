  "description": "This walk takes you along Catcleugh Reservoir before climbing to Girdle Fell for great views over the Northumberland National Park. The reservoir is located just off the A68 road near Byrness. There's a nice path leading south off the A68 which you can follow along the water. It's a lovely area with the reservoir surrounded by attractive countryside, heather, grassland and a mixture of native and conifer woodlands. It's also great for wildlife spotting with the higher moorland area a breeding ground for golden plover and dunlin. You may also see birds of prey such as buzzards, ospreys and occasionally a golden eagle.  Other wildlife to look out for includes otter, red squirrel, badger and roe deer. After passing the southern side of the water the path then climbs past Castle Crag Forest to Girdle Fell. From here there are wonderful views back down to the reservoir. The reservoir is located in Kielder Forest where you can enjoy miles of great cycling and walking trails. Just a few miles to the south you can visit Kielder Water and try the Kielder Forest Lakeside Way . The climb to Deadwater Fell is also just a few miles to the west. From here there are more great views to the Lake District and the Scottish Hills.",
