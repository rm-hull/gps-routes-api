Following a recent local campaign tje wppds have been retained in public ownership and are managed by the Forestry Commission. Patches of native woodland survive in predominantly coniferous plantation."

It contains miles of trails and footpaths with the option of extending your walk in the adjacent Fedw Wood and New Wood. Parking is available off Devauden Road about 1.5 miles north of St Arvans. The Wye Valley Walk passes nearby St Arvans so you could pick this up and head through Wyndcliffe Woods to Tintern Abbey to extend your walk.",
