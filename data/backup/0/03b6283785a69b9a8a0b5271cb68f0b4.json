  "description": "This walk takes you to the highest mountain in England along one of the most popular and scenic routes to the summit. The challenging climb from Seathwaite in beautiful Borrowdale takes in Styhead Gill, Styhead Tarn and the famous Corridor Route. The route starts in the little hamlet of Seathwaite a few miles north of the mountain. There's lots of roadside parking although it can get busy in the summer months. From here you pick up the footpath to Stockley Bridge along the pretty gill and then turn right towards Taylorgill Force waterfall. The path ascends along the running waters of Styhead Gill before coming to the lovely Styhead Tarn. You continue around Sty Head and Spout Head heading along the Corridor Route on a series of stone steps. The route takes you along the western flank of the Scafell massif with wonderful views of the fell. The final steep section takes you around Lingmell Col to the summit. Take a while to rest and enjoy the fabulous panoramic views of the Lakeland Fells before descending the same way. An alternative route is to continue along Grains Gill from Stockley Bridge. The path continues along Ruddy Gill, passing Sprinkling Tarn before rounding Great End and ascending to Scaffel Pike from the eastern side. To climb to the summit the most direct way try the Scafell Pike From Wasdale route. For a longer more challenging walk try the Scafell Pike from Langdale route. This route involves a fair amount of scrambling but with some wonderful views of the Langdale Valley and a visit to Angle Tarn.",
