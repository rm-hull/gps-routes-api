  "description": "Enjoy an easy walk along a section of the Lichfield Canal Heritage Trail. It runs along a recently restored section of the Lichfield Canal in Lichfield, Staffordshire. The walk starts from just south of Darnford Park. You then follow the canal west past the Borrowcop Locks Canal Park. Just to the east the canal links with the Coventry Canal where there are nice cycling and walking trails along the towpath. The Heart of England Way also crosses this section of the canal. You can pick it up near Darnford and follow it south towards Sutton Coldfield. Following it north west will take you through the city to the cathedral. Here you can learn about over 1300 years of history in the only medieval three-spired Cathedral in England. The route then heads west through the countryside towards Burntwood.",
