  "description": "This walk from Baldock visits two pretty nature reserves along the River Ivel which flows through the area. The settlement is a historic market town with interesting architecture, including Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian buildings. There's also good transport links to London from the train station. For walkers there's a few decent waymarked trails and some nice riverside nature reserves to visit. The walk starts from Baldock train station where you can pick up the Kingfisher Way. Follow the waymarked footpath north and it will take you to the river at Norton Mill and Radwell Meadows Country Park. There's some interesting willow sculptures of the characters from the Wind in the Willows to be found here. It's a lovely spot with some nice footpaths, a picnic area and lots of birds and butterflies to look out for. After exploring the park the route continues north to Stotfold where you will pass a the lovely Stotfold Mill Nature Reserve. Here you'll find an old mill with plantings of native trees, hedges and a wildflower meadow. The site includes a one mile walk with a wide grass path which ambles through the meadows and along the riverside. There's also information panels which will tell you all about this pretty area. After exploring the reserve the route returns to Baldock train station on the same paths. You could extend the walk by continuing along the Kingfisher Way to Astwick and Church End.",
