The stream divides near Llanfairpwll, one section flowing SE to discharge into the Menai Straits at Pwllfanogl. The other section flows a further six miles south westwards to enter the Straits near Dwyran The lowest bridging point on the longest section of the Braint is at Pont Cadach SH4465 which carries the A 4080, although there also stepping stones further downstream at SH4464. The lowest bridging point on the shortest section is also the A 4080 which crosses the stream at Aber Braint"

  "description": "This village in Anglesey is a fine place to start a walk with coast, woodland and a fine 1700s pub to visit. This circular walk explores the expansive Pentraeth Forest to the east of the settlement. There's some peaceful woodland trails and a climb to Mynydd Llwydiarth to enjoy here. Continue east and there are views towards Llyn Llwydiarth and Afon Braint which runs along the southern edge of the wood. On the way keep your eyes peeled for the resident red squirrels and a variety of woodland birds. The walk can be started from the small car parking area off the B5109, just to the east of the village. From here you can follow the footpaths north into the forest. On the northern side of the forest there's the beautiful Red Wharf Bay. Here you'll find a lovely sandy beach, interesting rock formations and a glorious section of the popular Anglesey Coast Path .",
