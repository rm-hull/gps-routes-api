  "description": "This huge forest in the Lake District has several way-marked cycling and walking trails to enjoy. There are six way-marked mountain bike trails of varying lengths and difficulty. These include a moderate (blue) 2 mile trail which visits the Goosey Foot and Juniper Tarns. The Hawkshead Moor Trail is graded red and visits the western side of the valley, overlooking Coniston Water. For an exciting rollercoaster ride try The North Face Mountain Bike Trail. The singletrack trail offers an adrenelising descent through oak woodlands and conifer forest. Walkers can enjoy 8 super, way-marked trails. These include the moderate Bogle Crag Trail which runs for 2.5 miles and features numerous sculptures along the way. The Silurian Way is a longer, more challenging walk which visits the summit of Carron Crag, the highest point in the forest. The walks offer great views of the Lake District mountains and lakes such as Coniston Water, Windermere and Esthwaite Water. There's a great visitor centre at the start of this circular route where you can hire bikes and find out more information on all the cycling and walking trails in the forest. At the northern end of the forest you can extend your walking at the popular Tarn Hows .",

There's also a raised outdoor seating area with good views over the forest. It's the perfect place to relax after your walk. You could also head into nearby Hawkshead and try the 17th century Sun Inn. They do really good food including an excellent fish and chips. It's a friendly place and can be easily found in the village on Main Street with a postcode of LA22 0NT for your sat navs. The inn also provides good quality accommodation and is very dog friendly if you have your pet with you."

There's also deer, rabbits and foxes in the forest so you'll need to have recall control when off the lead. The on site cafe mentioned above is also dog friendly."
