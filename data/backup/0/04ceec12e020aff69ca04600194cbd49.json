  "description": "This little village sits in a fine location in the beautiful River Conwy valley. It's a lovely place for a stroll with lots of pretty cottages and the Afon Roe, a tributary of the River Conwy, flowing through the village. There's also an excellent local pub to relax in after your exercise. Rowen is considered one of the prettiest villages in Wales and a real hidden gem. Rowen is a popular start point for the climb to Tal Y Fan which lies just to the west. It's also on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park where there are numerous walking options. This circular walk from the village takes you into the surrounding countryside on some quiet country lanes and footpaths. The lanes climb to the north providing some splendid views over the area. On the eastern side of the walk you will also visit the lovely Conwy Water Gardens. The gardens include a nature trail taking you through a peaceful woodland valley with lakes and lots of wildlife to see. Look out for pheasants, otters, various birds and lots of hens & ducks. There's also a Pancake House for refreshments and an Aquatic Centre.",

The Jubilee Path at Penmaenmawr can also be picked up in this area. For some interesting local history try the Dolgarrog Pipeline Walk to the south. This explores the area around the little village, visiting the impressive pipeline structure and the Coedty reservoir. Near here there's also the beautiful Llyn Eigiau where the reservoir dam was breached leading to the Dolgarrog Dam disaster of 1925."
