  "description": "Cross the western end of the Isle of Wight from north to south, and enjoy spectacular coastal views on this splendid trail. The trail starts at Hamstead Point on the northern coast, and climbs towards Shalcombe Down, passing Cranmore and Wellow on the way. This first section passes through woodland, near Cranmore, where red squirrels are often spotted. As the path climbs through Wellow and Shalcombe Down you will enjoy fabulous views of the Isle of Wight coastline, including The Needles and St Catherines Point. The walk finishes descending to Brook Bay on the southern coast of the island. The Tennyson Trail and the Freshwater Trail from Yarmouth to Freshwater Bay are good options for extending your walking in this part of the island.",
