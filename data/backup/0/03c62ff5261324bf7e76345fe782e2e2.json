  "description": "This rural Hampshire village has some nice local country and woodland trails to try. The attractive village includes a picturesque green, a historic 12th century church and a nice local pub. This circular walk from Bramley takes you to the historic Roman Fort at Silchester before heading to the neighbouring village of Tadley . You'll then enjoy some woodland trails in Pamber Forest before returning to Bramley via Little London. The walk starts just to the west of the train station near Minchens Court. You then head north past Bramley Frith Wood to Three Ashes, crossing the Silchester Brook on the way. Shortly after you come to one of the highlights of the area at the Calleva Atrebatum roman town in Silchester. Here you can enjoy a walk around the Roman Walls which are still visible for much of the circumference. The route continues west to Pamber Forest and the village of Tadley before heading south to Little Loddon. You then head east through the countryside to Bramley Corner before returning to the village.",
