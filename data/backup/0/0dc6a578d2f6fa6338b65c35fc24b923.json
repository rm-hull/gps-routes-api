  "description": "This circular walk explores the Leyburn Shawl limestone escarpment in Wensleydale. It's an interesting and attractive area with fine views from the elevated position of the Shawl. The walk starts from the western side of of the market town of Leyburn, next to Leyburn Hall. From here you can pick up a public footpath heading west up onto the Shawl. Here you'll find woodland sections, benches and open areas with wonderful views across the Yorkshire Dales. It's a good path running for two miles to Tullis Cote. Here you turn south, passing waterfalls, before crossing Wensley Park to enter the little village of Wensley. In the village you can enjoy a stroll down to Wensley Bridge and enjoy nice views of the River Ure. From Wensley you pick up a footpath heading north east, which will take you back into Leyburn where the route finishes. To continue your walking in the area you could try our other Leyburn Circular Walk which includes a riverside section along the Ure. Just to the east of the town there's a delightful hidden gem at the Harmby Waterfall or you could try our Middleham Circular Walk .",
