      "caption": "Roundabout from above. The Valley of Rocks runs roughly parallel with the coast of North Devon to the west of Lynton. It is the original course of the West Lyn River but some calamitous event caused the river to change its route many years ago, probably during the last Ice Age. So now the valley is dry and quite remarkably spectacular with towering lumps of rock on the northern side, and higher sweeping hills to the south. This view is taken from near to Rugged Jack, one of the large lumps of rock and is looking roughly westwards up the valley. Centre of picture is the rather curious little roundabout, which it seems serves no readily identifiable purpose."

  "description": "This walk visits the amazing Valley of the Rocks in the Exmoor National Park. The dry valley contains the geological marvels known as the Lynton Beds. These ancient rocks are a spectacular sight and hugely popular with walkers. This 4 mile circular walk starts in Lynton and heads west along the South West Coast Path to the Valley. Look out for feral goats as you make your way through the countryside. It's a good path and a fairly easy climb from Lynton, with wonderful views of the North Devon coast. You'll pass Wringcliff Bay, Castle Rock, Lee Bay and Lee Abbey.",
