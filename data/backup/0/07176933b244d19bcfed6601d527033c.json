  "description": "Explore this beautiful natural amphitheatre created by a huge glacier thousands of years ago. The walk begins at the Glen Doll car park, Glen Clova. You then pick up a good footpath heading towards Corrie Fee through Glendoll Forest. The route crosses White Water and follows the pretty Fee Burn into the nature reserve. It's a stunning site with the magnificent bowl shaped valley backed by a large waterfall. There's also beautiful alpine flowers and rare mountain willows clinging to the steep crags. It's wonderful for wildlife too with golden eagles and peregrines visitors to the area. It's easy to extend your walk on one of the many trails in Glen Doll Forest. One good option is to continue along the lovely White Water where it branches off to the north west at around the half way point of the route. You can then follow Jock's Road up to Crow Craigies and then on to Glen Callater, Loch Callater and Braemar. Also just to the north you will find the beautiful Loch Muick which has a fine circular trail to follow around the loch. From here you can also try the challenging climb to Lochnagar for stunning views over the Cairngorms. Our Glen Clova Walk will take you to the reserve along a country lane from the nearby hotel at Clova. Around here you can extend your walking on the well defined path up to the lovely Loch Brandy .",
