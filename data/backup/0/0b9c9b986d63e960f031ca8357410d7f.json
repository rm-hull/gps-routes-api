Passengers were disembarked at South Queensferry for shore excursions.

  "description": "A coastal walk from Blackness to South Queensferry near Edinburgh. The route follows the John Muir Way for about 5.5 miles with fine views over the Firth of Forth. The walk starts at Blackness where features include the 15th century Blackness Castle and pier. From here you can pick up the John Muir Way and follow the trail east through Wester Shore Wood to Nethermill Bridge and Abercorn. The route then passes Hopetoun House where there is an expansive estate surrounding the 18th century country house. During the summer months, parts of the castle and gardens are open to visitors. The route continues east past Society Point, East Shore Wood and Port Edgar before coming into Queensferry. Here you can extend the walk on the Forth Road Bridge which spans the Firth of Forth. There is a walkway/cycleway running across the bridge to North Queensferry where you can link up with the popular Fife Coastal Path .",
