  "description": "This walk in Towcester takes you around the waterside parks located next to the River Tove. On the way you'll enjoy nice riverside paths, a visit to Towcester Racecourse and views of an interersting old ancient\u00a0castle. The walk starts from Shire Meadows Park just north east of the town centre. Here you can enjoy riverside paths along the Tove and enjoy views of Bury Mount Motte. The site includes the recently restored remains of an earthwork\u00a0motte and bailey\u00a0fortification or ancient\u00a0castle. The Motte probably dates back to the 11th Century when it was a\u00a0Norman\u00a0fortification but over time was subject to neglect. Follow the paths south along the mill stream and you will soon come to the edge of Towcester Racecourse. Recently rebuilt, it hosts\u00a0National Hunt racing\u00a0race meetings (over jumps) in the Winter months. It is situated on the\u00a0Easton Neston\u00a0estate. The route then heads west through the centre of the town along a nice riverside path. This will take you along the Silverstone Brook to the point where it meets with the Grafton Way . This long distance footpath is a great way of extening your walking around Towcester. You could follow the path north to Greens Norton or south to Pury End. Other good options are the woodland trails in nearby Hazelborough Wood or Bucknell Woods . To the north of the town you can enjoy a waterside stroll along the Northampton Canal into Northampton.",
