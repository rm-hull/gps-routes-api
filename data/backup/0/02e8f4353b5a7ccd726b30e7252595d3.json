  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle through the beautiful Wicken Fen Nature Reserve in Cambridgeshire. National Cycle Route 11 runs right through Wicken Fen and there are some peaceful country lanes around the reserve. Bike hire is available from just \u00a35. The route below starts at the pretty village of Wicken before passing through the reserve and into the surrounding countryside. You follow quiet lanes to Upware, located on the River Cam, before returning to Wicken Village. In the reserve you will find flowering meadows, reedbeds and waterways where you can see a variety of wildlife such as hen harriers, water voles and bitterns. In the Baker's Fen area you can also see konik ponies, highland cattle, lapwings and barn owls. If you're on foot you can follow the Boardwalk Trail or the longer Nature Trail while stopping off at one of the many bird hides. In the summer months you can also enjoy a 50 minute boat trip along the waterways of Wicken Fen. A number of options are available if you would like to continue your outing. If you're on foot you could follow the Fen Rivers Way along the River Great Ouse to Ely. For cyclists National Route 11 runs along quiet roads and the River Great Ouse to Ely. Or you can head east towards Newmarket via Burwell.",
