  "description": "This waymarked circular walk explores the countryside and woodland around the Herefordshire village of Mordiford. The area comprises of a number of pretty orchards where you can look out for Lesser-spotted Woodpeckers. There's also woodland trails, an Iron Age Hillfort and lots of nice Herefordshire countryside to enjoy. The route runs for just under 4 miles with some small climbs on the way. You can start the walk from the village or from the car park at Cockshoot Old Sufton. The village is very interesting and worth exploring. The bridge over the River Lugg dates from the 14th century. It is the oldest surviving bridge in Herefordshire. The walk visits Bears Wood and skirts the edge of Haugh Woods . You'll also pass Backbury Hillfort which dates from the Iron Age. You can extend your walk by exploring Haugh Woods with its popular butterfly trails. Also of interest is the Wye Valley Walk which passes through the village. You can pick this up and head into Hereford along the river.",
