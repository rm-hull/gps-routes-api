  "description": "This Kent based town is located just north of Folkestone , near the coast. This walk follows footpaths east to Old Hawkinge where you can enjoy some nice views over the Alkham Valley countryside. In the town you could also visit the Kent Battle of Britain Museum . The aviation museum is focused on the Allied and Axis men of the\u00a0Battle of Britain in 1940. There are artefacts from over 700 crashed aircraft on display here. The\u00a0Spirit of the Few Monument\u00a0is also located in the grounds of the museum. See the video below for more details. To continue your walking in the area head south west to Peene Quarry Country Park where there's the Folkestone White Horse and some nice views to the coast.",
