  "description": "The Longshaw Estate is a National Trust owned country park in Upper Padley in the Peak District. The estate is perfect for walking with fabulous views of the Peak District, ancient woods, parkland and heather moorland. In the park there are pretty ponds, a waterside path along Barbrage Brook and the lovely Big Moor where you should look out for red deer. There are also excellent facilities with a tea room, shop and the Moorland Discovery Centre. From easter 2014 there will be two new bridleways suitable for cyclists. The routes will be waymarked so you can explore the estate on two wheels or on foot. The Derwent Valley Heritage Way runs near the estate so you could continue your walk along the River Derwent. You could also continue south and climb up to Froggatt Edge and Curbar Edge where there are spectacular views of the Peak District. The wonderful Padley Gorge Trail with its babbling brook and pretty waterfalls is another good option. You're also close to Stanage Edge where you can enjoy fabulous views and interesting rock formations. The park is located just a few miles from Sheffield.",
