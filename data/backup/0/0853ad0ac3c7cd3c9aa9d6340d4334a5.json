  "description": "This lovely market town near Leeds is well worth a visit for its architecture and fascinating history. It's also a great place for walkers with easy access to the beautiful Wharfedale and some delighful parks nearby too. This walk takes you along the Ebor Way long distance trail to the splendid Harewood House. The waymarked trail follows the River Wharfe with great views over the Wharfedale countryside. It runs for about 10 miles with a few moderate climbs along the way. Start the walk on Wetherby Bridge in the town centre and cross to the southern side of the water. The route heads south west along the river passing the Wetherby Ings water meadows. You then head towards Collingham before turning west to Lime Kiln Wood and Woodhall Bridge. You continue to Netherby where you turn south toward Harewood House. The park is a great place for walking with miles of footpaths taking you to woodland, a deer park, lakes and a walled garden. After exploring the park you can catch a bus back to Wetherby most days. You could also turn it into a longer circular walk by following the Leeds Country Way east to Bardsey and then picking up country lanes through Collingham. The Leeds Country Way long distance walk passes the park. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area you could follow this path south west to Eccup Reservoir. The reservoir has nice waterside paths and is a great place for spotting Red Kites and other birds. To continue your walking from Wetherby try the Wetherby to Spofforth Castle Walk along the old Wetherby Railway Line. It's a nice easy stroll finishing at the historic ruins of Spofforth Castle. Just to the south of the town you will find Hetchell Woods. The nature reserve has peaceful woodland trails, pretty streams and lots of wildlife to look out for. The site also includes the imposing rocky outcrop of Hetchell Crags and the fascinating Roman earthworks at Pompocali. Just to the north you can pick up the excellent Knaresborough Round which explores the countryside around Knaresborough.",
