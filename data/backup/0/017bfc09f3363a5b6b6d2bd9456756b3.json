The manor has a rich history, having been owned by just four families since the 11th century: the Brett, Morgan, Brodrepp, and Compton families, all connected through the female line. In 1919, the manor was sold to Ethel Labouchere, who owned it until her death in 1955. Subsequently, it was acquired by Victor Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, and after his death in 1995, it passed to his son, the 11th Earl of Sandwich."

The grounds and formal gardens are now Grade II* listed, reflecting their historical and aesthetic significance. The gardens were awarded the title of Historic Houses Garden of the Year in 2020. Currently, the house is managed by Viscount and Viscountess Hinchingbrooke, who, in January 2023, announced plans to open the manor for a limited number of private tours. The manor house itself was notably voted the \"Nation's Finest Manor House\" by Country Life magazine in 2006, underlining its importance and appeal."

This original Tudor building still forms part of the north wing of the present-day house. Significant changes were made in the 1660s by Richard Brodrepp, who added the hall, west front, dovecote, and stable blocks. Later, in the 18th century, a Georgian staircase was added by a second Richard Brodrepp."
