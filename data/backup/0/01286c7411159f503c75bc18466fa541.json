  "description": "Visit this fascinating ruined 15th and 17th century castle and enjoy wonderful views over Loch Awe. There is a good walking track running from a parking area on the A85 to the castle. It's a lovely flat path with super views of the castle and the loch for the whole way. At the castle you can explore the tower house and courtyard before climbing the keep for wonderful views over Loch Awe. There is also a jetty over the water where there are great views back to the castle. You can return on the same path or along grassy paths by the loch if it is not too wet. Head a few miles west and you could try the Cruachan Dam and Falls of Cruachan Waterfall Walk. The impressive hydroelectric dam takes water between Cruachan Reservoir to Loch Awe, a height difference of 396 metres (1,299 ft). In the area you can also visit the Falls of Cruachan and explore the Cruachan Power Station. The Falls of Cruachan railway station is a good way of visiting the area by public transport.",
