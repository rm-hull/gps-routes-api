  "description": "Follow good footpaths around the western side of this beautiful lake in the Brecon Beacons National Park. Llangorse is the largest natural lake in Wales and a must see of the region. It is located near to the town of Brecon and the village of Llangors. The walk starts at the northern end of the lake where parking is available. You then follow waymarked public footpaths through the pretty countryside to a lakeside viewpoint at Llangasty. Here you'll also find a 19th century lakeside church. The lake is surrounded by some lovely scenery with green hills, fields and meadows. The area is also a nature reserve so look out for a variety of wildlife on your walk. These include otters, water voles, coots, swallows, swifts and geese. Also of interest is the Crannog - an ancient man-made island of oak, willow and hazel wood. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then the Taff Trail is located nearby. You can pick it up in Talybont On Usk where you can also enjoy a riverside walk along the Usk Valley Walk. Running just to the south east of the site is the Brecon Beacons Way. The epic long distance trail is a great way of exploring the national park on foot.",

Head into Llangors village and you can pay a visit to the Red Lion. The country pub does good food and has nice gardens to sit out in. You can find them at postcode LD3 7TY for your sat navs. Nearby there's also the Castle Inn which is another friendly place with outdoor seating."

      "content": "If you head about 2 miles south of the lake you'll come to the little village of Talybont-on-Usk. Here you could pick up the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and stroll down to Talybont Reservoir. There's a lovely cycling and walking trail along the lake in the shape of the popular Taff Trail. The circular Henry Vaughan Walk also starts and finishes in Talybont. The interesting literary walk follows in the footsteps of the 17th century poet Henry Vaughan. It visits the pretty Vaughan Garden and features a series of information panels with details of his life and works. To the east is the climb to Mynydd Troed and Cockit Hill from Pengenffordd. There's great views down to the lake from here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Brecon Beacons Walks page."
