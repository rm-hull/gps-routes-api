  "description": "These beautiful 30 acre gardens in Harrogate are a splendid place for an afternoon stroll. The area is geologically significant with a series of Millstone Grit rock formations overlooking a tranquil lake. There's also woodland trails with bluebells and rhododendrons. You can follow narrow paths through the dramatic rocks before a short climb to a lovely viewpoint overlooking the lake. The site has an interesting history dating back to the 18th century when the gardens were originally created. The artist J.M.W. Turner painted two oil paintings of the area called 'Plompton Rocks' after his first visit to Yorkshire in 1797. If you would like to extend your walk you could pick up the Harrogate Ringway which runs just to the west of the site. You can follow it through the Crimple Valley or towards Knaresborough. Also of interest is the Harlow Carr to Valley Gardens walk . This route visits two beautiful gardens which are situated only a mile apart in the town centre.",
