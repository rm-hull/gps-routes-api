  "description": "Also known as the Yately Lakes this lovely country park near Sandhurst has some nice waterside trails to try. The park has numerous pretty lakes, an animal park, an indoor play area and an excellent lakeside cafe. Sandhurst railway station is right next to the park so you can easily come by train. The route also visits the adjacent Horseshoe Lake and the Moor Green Lakes Nature Reserve where there are excellent bird watching opportunities. The Three Castles Path , the Blackwater Valley Footpath and the Wokingham Way all run past the park so you could pick up any of these trails to continue your walk. Yately Common Country Park is also nearby.",
