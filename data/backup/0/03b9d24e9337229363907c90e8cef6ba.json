  "description": "A popular riverside walk along the River Arun from Amberley to Arundel. The walk takes you along a delightful waterside footpath and includes a visit to the splendid Arundel Castle and Arundel Park on the return leg. The walk starts in Amberley where you follow a public footpath west towards Bury. Here you pick up the riverside trail and follow it south past Houghton, South Stoke and Offham before coming into Arundel. There's great views of the medieval castle as you pass through the town. On the return leg you pick up a section of the Monarch's Way long distance trail to take you through the expansive Arundel Park. Here you'll find woodland trails, a lovely lake and the splendid Arundel Wetland Centre where you can look out for a wide variety of wildlife including water voles and rare geese. The trail eventually leads you back to Houghton where you pick up the river again and follow it back to Amberley. If you would like a shorter walk you can always just catch the train back from Arundel to Amberley rather than come back through the park. To continue your walking in the area you could try our Amberley Circular Walk which takes you onto the beautiful South Downs to the south of the village. You could also visit the Slindon Estate and Angmering Park Estate Woods where there are more fine trails to try.",
