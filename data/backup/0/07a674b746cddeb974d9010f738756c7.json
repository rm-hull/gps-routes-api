  "description": "This walk takes you from the Cumbrian village of Brigsteer to Brigsteer Woods and the fine viewpoint at the 18th century Helsington Church. You can reach the woods by following a country lane south from the village. Here you will find a number of peaceful woodland trails and the Simms Well. The woods are run by the National Trust and include a wide variety of flora and fauna. The route returns via Holesack and the noteworthy Helsington Church. The church dates back to 1726 and commands extensive views across the Lyth Valley towards the distant Lakeland fells and Morecambe Bay. It's a great spot with view indicators detailing the various sights you can see from the elevated position of the historic church. Just to the east of the route you can extend your walking in the Sizergh Castle estate. The National Trust owned estate has some lovely gardens, orchards and semi-natural woodland to explore. Just to the south there's Levens Hall where you can enjoy some fine topiary and views of the River Kent. To the north there's the more challenging climb to Scout Scar where there's more tremendous views to the Lakeland Fells.",
