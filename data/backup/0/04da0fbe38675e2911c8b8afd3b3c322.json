  "description": "This town near Leeds has a fine local park and is also close to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the River Aire. This walk from Horsforth Hall Park takes you through the countryside to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal where you can follow the towpath to the historic Kirkstall Abbey. The walk starts in Horsforth Hall Park. This large park is a lovely place for a stroll in the town. There's open parkland and a Japanese formal garden to see here. From the park you head north west to pick up the Leeds Country Way. Follow this waymarked footpath west and it will take you past Woodleigh Hall to Cragg Wood. Near here you pick up a riverside path along the River Aire which will take you to Apperley Bridge. Cross the river here and you can then pick up the Aire Valley Towpath and follow it east to Calverley Bridge and Rodley. There's the Rodley Nature Reserve here with a visitor centre and lots of wildlife to look out for. The route continues east to Newlay and Sandford before coming to Kirstall Abbey. The atmospheric 12th century abbey includes some lovely parkland and gardens right next to the River Aire. From the abbey park it is a short walk to Headingley Station where you can catch a train back to Horsforth.",
