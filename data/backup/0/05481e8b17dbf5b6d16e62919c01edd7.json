  "description": "Westward Ho! is a lovely seaside village in North Devon with a nice beach and some great coastal walking. This circular walk takes you from the town to the nearby Northam Burrows Country Park using a section of the South West Coast Path National Trail. The park includes fine views over the estuary of the River Torridge with 600 acres of grassy coastal plain, salt marsh, sand dunes and grasslands. You start the walk on the front in Westward Ho! where you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it north to the park. You'll pass the pretty Sandymere before rounding the headland, where there are fine views over the beach and river estuary. The route then passes Appledore Bridge before following a minor road back into the village. You could extend the walk by continuing east to Appledore. The village is located at the mouth of the River Torridge and includes a ferry service over to Instow where you can pick up the Tarka Trail and visit the lovely Braunton Burrows Nature Reserve and Crow Point. Heading south along the coast path will take you to Buck's Mills woodland nature reserve and Clovelly.",

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "The village name comes from the title of Charles Kingsley's novel Westward Ho! (1855), which was set in nearby Bideford. The book was a bestseller, and entrepreneurs saw the opportunity to develop tourism in the area. Just to the west of the village you can visit Peppercombe Castle. Here you will find an Iron Age Hillfort and the small stream of Peppercombe Water which is a little over a kilometre long, but its valley is relatively deep. It ends in a waterfall consisting in a series of cascades, each between 0.5 and 1.5 metres high, that have formed due to the unequal hardness of the different beds of the underlying rock. The area is also geologically significant, with distinctive red cliffs that extend for about 2 km inland. Near here you will also find the little village of Bucks Mills where there's a woodland nature reserve. You can find out more on the Bucks Mills to Clovelly Walk. Just to the south of nearby Barnstaple you can enjoy a climb to the viewpoint on Codden Hill from the village of Bishop's Tawton. Here you'll find the monument to Caroline Thorpe, wife of local MP Jeremy Thorpe who became embroiled in the Thorpe scandal of the 1970s. There's also some splendid views over the area and waterside trails along the pretty Venn Stream to enjoy."
