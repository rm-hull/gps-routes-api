  "description": "Enjoy a coastal walk between these two attractive Kent towns. It's a nice easy, five mile walk, using a section of the Saxon Shore Way. You can return the same way or catch a train back to Whitstable. The route starts by Whitstable Harbour which is flanked by attractive shingle/sandy beaches. One notable feature of the town is 'The Street', a natural strip of shingle on clay bank which runs out to sea at right angles to the coast, for a distance of about 1\u20442 mile (800 m). Located to the east of the harbour, The Street is revealed only at low tide, when it is possible to walk out along it. From the harbour you head east past Tankerton Beach with its row of expensive beach huts. The route continues past Hampton Pier and beach, before finishing at Herne Bay Pier. The town includes an impressive 2 miles (3 km) shingle beach, which has been awarded a European Blue Flag and the yellow and blue Seaside Award for its safety and cleanliness. The seafront also features a Victorian bandstand and gardens, amusement arcades, children's play areas and the world's first freestanding purpose-built Clock Tower, built in 1837. To extend your walking in the area, you can continue east along the coast to Birchington and Margate. If you head south from Whitstable you can visit Clowes Wood. Here you will find lots of nice walking and cycling trails through mixed woodland, heathland and wet meadow.",
