  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this super coastal country park in the Wirral.  The park covers 400 acres making it the largest park in the Wirral. There is a super waterside cycling and walking path running along the lovely Wirral Peninsula - you could even continue along it to Wallasey and beyond if you have time. The park is excellent for birdwatching as the area attracts huge numbers of wading birds, including Oystercatcher, Common Redshank, Dunlin, Sanderling, Ruddy Turnstone, Northern Lapwing, Bar-tailed Godwit and Curlew. The route below also continues to the nearby Ditton Lane Nature Reserve - another great spot for birdwatching. The park is located very near to Leasowe rail station.",
