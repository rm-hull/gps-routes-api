  "description": "This circular walk makes use of the Haworth-Hebden Bridge Walk , the Calderdale Way and the Rochdale Canal to take you on a tour of the countryside, woodland, moors and hills surrounding this attractive Yorkshire town. The market town of Hebden Bridge sits on the River Calder and the Rochdale Canal in the Upper Calder Valley. It's a great base for walkers with a series of waymarked trails to follow through the surrounding area. There's waterside walking along rivers and canals and great views of the hills of the South Pennines. The town is characterised by traditional Yorkshire sandstone buildings, and interesting Victorian architecture. It's very pleasant to just stroll around the central area of the town which has lots of nice cafes and pubs where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. Hebden Bridge is accessible by rail from it's own railway station which is on the Calder Valley Line between Manchester Victoria and Leeds City. There are frequent train services from Blackpool, Manchester and Leeds so it's an easy place to get to and from on public transport. This walk starts in the centre of the town and follows part of the Haworth to Hebden Bridge Walk along Hebden Water to Midgehole and Pecket Well. Around Midgehole you have the option of taking a detour west and visiting Hebden Dale and the National Trust owned Hardcastle Crags . The beautiful wooded valley contains tumbling streams, beautiful waterfalls and the fascinating Gibson Mill. Around Pecket Well you pick up a section of the Calderdale Way which climbs to Wadsworth Moor and Midgley Moor. This is a challenging section, climbing to a height of over 1200ft. You'll pass Cock Hill and Crow Hill before descending towards the hill-top village of Midgley. There's some great moorland views from the elevated position of the moors. At Midgley you pick up the towpath of the Rochdale Canal to take you back to Hebden Bridge. It's a pretty section of the canal which passes the little village of Mytholmroyd on the way. There's lots of other great walks around the town to try if you have time. You could pick up the Pennine Bridleway and head south to Stoodley Pike where there are more fantastic views to enjoy. Just beyond that is the pretty Withens Clough Reservoir which has a nice circular footpath around the perimeter.",
