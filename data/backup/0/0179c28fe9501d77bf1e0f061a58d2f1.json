  "description": "This popular circular walk explores the Nantlle Ridge range of mountains in the Snowdonia National Park. You'll visit a series of imposing peaks with magnificent views over Snowdonia. The scenery is breathtaking as you make your way along one of the finest ridge walks in Britain. The walk starts from the village of Rhyd Ddu and heads to the first peak of Y Garn which is only about a mile away. At the 633 m (2,077 ft) Y Garn summit you will find a rocky plateau, steep cliffs and cairns. The route continues to the next peak on the ridge - Mynydd Drws-y-Coed. This exposed peak requires a degree of scrambling to reach the 695 m (2,280 ft) summit. From here you climb to the second highest peak on the ridge, Trum y Ddysgl. From the 709 m (2,326 ft) summit you can enjoy wonderful views of Mynydd Mawr, Yr Wyddfa and Moel Hebog. The route then descends to the next peak of Mynydd Tal-y-Mignedd,  a subsidiary summit of Trum y Ddysgl. Here you will find a large stone obelisk, put up to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Continuing south west you come to the highest point on the Nantlle Ridge, Craig Cwm Silyn. From the 734 m (2,408 ft) summit there are wonderful 360 panoramic views of the area. The other peaks on the ridge are Garnedd Goch Mynydd Graig Goch. They are a few miles west of Craig Cwm Silyn and not visited on this walk. From Craig Cwm Silyn you descend to Cwm Trwsgl, passing a small reservoir and a quarry. The final section then takes you through the attractive woodland of Beddgelert Forest before returning to Rhyd Ddu.",
