  "description": "These two neighbouring villages are located in a pleasant spot on the River Tyne in Northumberland. This circular walk visits the two villages and explores the Tyne Riverside Country Park and the pretty Whittle Dene Woodland. You can start the walk from the train station or the car park at the country park. Then cross Ovingham Bridge and head west along the river to Alder Wood and Ovington. You can then follow public footpaths east to visit Whittle Dene where you will find some pleasant woodland trails, streams and the ruins of the old corn mill. The woods are located just north of Ovingham and are a peaceful and scenic place for a local walk. The route then heads south to return to Ovingham. To extend the walk you could continue north through Whittle Dene Woods to visit Whittle Dene Reservoir where you can pick up the epic Hadrian's Wall Path. Head east and you could visit nearby Wylam and Stephenson's Cottage where you can learn about the great railway pioneer George Stephenson.",
