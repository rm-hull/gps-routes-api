  "description": "This East Sussex market town is in a good location for exploring the woods and countryside of the High Weald. The impressive country views of the local area inspired painter Joseph Mallord William Turner to paint The Vale of Heathfield which now hangs in the Tate Gallery. This circular walk from the town visits Old Heathfield, Heathfield Park and St Dunstan's Wood. The walk starts in the town centre and heads south east along country lanes towards Heathfield Park. It's a private estate but you can follow a country lane along the western side of the park before turning east to visit Old Heathfield. The Grade II listed country house dates back to 1677. From Old Heathfield you can follow footpaths south east to explore St Dunstan's Wood. Footpaths will take you through Fountain Wood and Becklington Wood before coming to Caller's Corner, where there are some small waterfalls. Here you turn north towards Cade Street before heading west to return to Old Heathfield. The route then heads west through Sandy Cross where you pick up the popular Cuckoo Trail. This shared cycling and walking route will take you north back into the town centre.",

A few miles to the west you can pick up the Wealdway and the Vanguard Way near Framfield. To the east you can visit the worthy village of Burwash. Our circular walk from the village visits on of the area's highlights at the National Trust's Bateman's. The fine 17th century Jacobean house was the home of author Rudyard Kipling during the early part of the 20th century. You can explore the house and the surrounding gardens with some great views of the surrounding High Weald countryside. To the north is the village of Mayfield where you'll find a 15th century church, views of the River Rother and a fine 16th century pub.
