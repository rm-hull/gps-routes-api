  "description": "This is a walk to the highest point in Dorset from the small town of Beaminster. It follows the Wessex Ridgeway for just over 3 miles, through some lovely countryside, to the 279 m (915 ft) summit of Lewesdon Hill. The hill is the site of an Iron Age hill fort and has woodland walking trails to explore. There are good views from the top but these are somewhat obscured by the woods. Nonetheless the views through the trees are extensive with Devon, Somerset and the south coast all visible on a clear day. If you would like to extend your walk in this lovely area then you could continue west to Pilsdon Pen where there is another hill fort and fabulous views over the area.",

You can find the traditional stone pub in the village at a postcode of DT8 3QD for your sat navs. It's also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you. Back in Beaminster there's The Ollerod to consider. The food is of a very high quality and there's a lovely terrace and garden to sit out in on warmer days. You can find them at 3 Prout Bridge DT8 3AY. The Greyhound is another option in the town centre. They serve good quality pub food and provide a decent selection of ales. You can find them on the Square at postcode DT8 3AW."

It uses part of the Wessex Ridgeway to visit some local historical highlights including Toller Whelme Manor House, Parnham House and Mapperton House with its beautiful gardens. Head a few miles south west and you could try the National Trust's Lamberts Castle to Coneys Castle Walk. The walk visits two more historic old hill forts with great views to enjoy For more walking ideas in the area see the Dorset Walks page."
