  "description": "This is a walk to the highest point in Dorset from the small town of Beaminster . It follows the Wessex Ridgeway for just over 3 miles, through some lovely countryside, to the 279\u00a0m (915\u00a0ft) summit of Lewesdon Hill. The hill is the site of an\u00a0Iron Age\u00a0hill fort and has woodland walking trails to explore. There are good views from the top but these are somewhat obscured by the woods. Nonetheless the views through the trees are extensive with Devon, Somerset and the south coast all visible on a clear day. If you would like to extend your walk in this lovely area then you could continue west to Pilsdon Pen where there is another hill fort and fabulous views over the area.",
