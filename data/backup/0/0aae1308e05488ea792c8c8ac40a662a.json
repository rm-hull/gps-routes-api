  "description": "The village of Severn Beach is located in a lovely spot on the\u00a0Severn Estuary. There is a popular walkway along the length of the sea defences where you can enjoy views across the estuary. It's also a fine spot for birdwatching with several species of wader to look out for on the way. This walk takes you north from the village on the Severn Way to the nearby Severn Bridge . The walk starts from the Severn Beach train station which is the terminus of the\u00a0Severn Beach Line\u00a0railway. You can catch trains here from\u00a0Bristol Temple Meads railway station with a journey time of about 40 minutes. From the little station it's a short stroll to the beach where you can pick up the sea wall path and the Severn Way. Follow the waymarked trail north and it will take you past Redwick and New Passge to Northwick Warth and Northwick Oaze. The trail continues to Aust where you can enjoy fine views of the Severn Bridge. The suspension bridge is one of the landmarks of the area, spanning the rivers Severn\u00a0and\u00a0Wye. It provides access from England into Wales for walkers and cars. The bridge was opened on 8 September 1966, by\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II and took over 3 years to construct. In Aust village there's an interesting old church dating from the 15th century and a local pub for refreshments. After exploring the village the route returns to Severn Beach on the same paths.",
