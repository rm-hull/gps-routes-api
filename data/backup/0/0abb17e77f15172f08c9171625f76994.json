  "description": "This small market town is located in County Durham on the River Wear. There's some nice riverside and countryside trails to try in the area. It's surrounded by the moorland of the North Pennines where there are lots of good opportunities for walkers too. The town is also notable as the current terminus of the Weardale Railway, a historic heritage railway. It runs from Bishop Auckland, with stations at Frosterley , Wolsingham and Witton-le-Wear. This walk takes you from the town to nearby Frosterley on the Weardale Way. The waymarked trail runs along the river and through the attractive countryside to the south east of the town. At the end of the walk you could return on the same paths or catch the splendid Weardale Railway back to Stanhope. You can extend the walk by continuing east to Wolsingham .",
