  "description": "The Barrow Way runs from Robertstown, County Kildare to St Mullin's, County Carlow. The long distance trail covers around 100 kilometres (62 miles), following the River Barrow and the Grand Canal . On the way you'll pass Rathangan, Monasterevin, Athy,  Carlow, Leighlinbridge, Muine Bheag, Goresbridge, Borris and Graiguenamanagh  Some of the sections are also suitable for cyclists. The section between Graiguenamanagh and St Mullins is particularly lovely with views of the Barrow Navigation canal and its pretty locks. See the Graiguenamanagh to St Mullins Walk page for more details on this section. Scroll down for a detailed map of the route and a gpx file.",
