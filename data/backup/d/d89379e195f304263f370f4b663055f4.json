  "description": "This circular walk explores Blakey Ridge in Rosedale. The ridge reaches a height of over 1,300 feet (400 m), commanding fine views over the North York Moors. After visiting the ridge the walk explores the surrounding moors. It's about a 12 mile hike with the majority of the route taking place on elevated paths over 1200ft above sea level. As such there's wonderful moorland views to enjoy for the majority of the walk. Start the walk from the parking area on Stepin Turn, just to the south of the ridge summit. Follow the road north past the Lion Inn and you will soon come to a footpath on your left leading up to the summit. The route then crosses High Blakely Moor, Farndale Moor and Middle Head before coming to Bloworth Crossing. Here you turn south, following a track past Bloworth Wood before turning east toward Church Houses. The final section follows country lanes back to the car park. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the splendid Lion Inn pub. At Church Houses you will pass the northern edge of the Farndale Daffodil Walk. The 'wild' daffodils of Farndale are very well known and attract large numbers of visitors in the spring. The River Dove also runs through the area with the pretty daffodils lining the riverbank.",
