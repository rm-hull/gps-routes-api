  "description": "This walk climbs to the crash site of the USAF Boeing RB-29A Superfortress at Higher Shelf Stones, Bleaklow. The aircraft crashed on the 3rd November 1948, whilst en route from Scampton to Burtonwood with all 13 crew members killed. Much of the wreckage and a memorial to those who lost their lives can be viewed on Shelf Moor, just to the east of Glossop. It's fairly challenging 5 mile walk from the town to the site, reaching a height of over 2000ft on the elevated moor. This walk starts from Glossop train station but you could also start from the parking area on the A57 Snake Pass road, just to the south of the moor. There's also the option of starting from the Birchin Clough car park in Lady Clough Woods as shown in the video below. From the train station you head north east through the town before turning east to follow the Doctor's Gate Roman Road to Crooked Clough. Here you turn left to follow footpaths up to Higher Shelf Stones where you can see the remains of the Superfortress, part of the 16th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron. You can continue along the path to Lower Shelf Stones where you will find more interesting rock formations and incredible views over the surrounding hills of the area. After exploring the site the route descends back into Glossop on the same paths. The site is located just to the south of Bleaklow which is a great place to extend your walk. You can reach the hill summit by using a section of the Pennine Way which runs just to the east of Higher Shelf Stones.",

The area is a bit of a hidden gem with walks along the River Etherow to some beautiful waterfalls and wonderful rock formations. The walk starts from the car park at the eastern end of Woodhead Reservoir. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
