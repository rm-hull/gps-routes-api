  "description": "Enjoy beautiful woodland walks and extensive open lands in this country park in Brighton. There's a number of footpaths to follow around the park which includes the village of Stanmer, Stanmer House and Stanmer Church. These would once have formed the estate of Stanmer House which is a Grade I listed 18th century Palladian building. You can sometimes pick up guided walks around the extensive woods where you can look out for bats and other wildlife. Located on the beautiful South Downs it's easy to extend your walk after you have explored the park. You could pick up the South Downs Way and enjoy a climb to the nearby Ditchling Beacon for great views over the area.",
