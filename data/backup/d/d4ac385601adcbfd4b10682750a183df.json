  "description": "A short circular walk through Trowbridge Park and along the River Biss. The walk starts in Trowbridge Park, just to the east of the train station. The park has some nice tree lined footpaths taking you to a war memorial and a delightful sensory garden. Head south through the park and you will soon meet with the River Biss. If you would like a longer walk you can continue south into Biss Meadows Country Park where there's nice waterside trails and lots of wildlife to look out for. This walk heads west along the river, passing the cinema and the library before leaving the river. You then head through the town centre to the Trowbridge Museum. Here you can hear the story of\u00a0woollen\u00a0cloth production in the town from its domestic beginnings through to the mechanisation of the process.\u00a0Shortly after the route returns you to the park and the finish point. To continue your walking in the area head south west to Southwick Country Park . The 100 acre park has a series of good walking trails to try. At the northern edge of the town you can also pick up the towpath of the Kennet and Avon Canal . Following it east will take you to the nearby town of Bradford on Avon where there are more nice riverside trails along the River Avon.",
