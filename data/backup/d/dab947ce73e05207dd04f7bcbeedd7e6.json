  "description": "Explore the extensive parkland surrounding this former Augustinian priory and home to Lord Byron. This circular walk starts at the village of Linby and takes you to Papplewick Hall where you join the Robin Hood Way. This takes you north passing the Lower Lake before a woodland stretch through Abbey Wood. You then turn west, passing Newstead Abbey and the Upper Lake. You continue through farmland to Freckland Wood where you turn south and return to Linby. The abbey grounds are truly beautiful with lakes, ponds, cascades and the River Leen all major highlights. There are also a number of beautifully laid out gardens including a Japanese Garden, a Rose Garden, a Sub-Tropical Garden and a French Garden. Look out for wildlife that includes peacocks, swans and geese. You can also tour the fascinating house which was originally founded as a monastery in the 12th century. You can find out all about the Abbey's early history by visiting the medieval cloisters, Chapter House (now the Chapel) and the collection of medieval stone carvings and manuscripts. Lord Byron lived in the house in the early 19th century. You can view the Byron collection of objects, furniture, letters and manuscripts to gain an understanding of his time at Newstead. If you would like to continue your walking in the Mansfield area you can head east along the Robin Hood Way to the nearby Burntstump Country Park where you will find miles of peaceful woodland walks. Just to the north you will find Kings Mill Reservoir which has a nice trail to follow around the water.",

      "content": "The Papplewick Walk starts from the interesting nearby village and also visits the abbey. The worthy village is a conservation area with an ancient church, 18th century cottages and the Grade I listed Papplewick Hall. The circular walk visits Blidworth where you can enjoy peaceful woodland trails around Blidworth Woods. Head a few miles west and you could visit another local historic highlight at Felley Priory. The 15th century house is surrounded by some beautiful gardens with herbaceous borders, splendid topiary and bluebell woodland. The waterside trails at Moorgreen Reservoir and Hucknall's Bestwood Country Park can also be found in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nottinghamshire Walks page."
