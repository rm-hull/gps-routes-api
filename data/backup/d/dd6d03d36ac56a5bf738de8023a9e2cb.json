  "description": "This walk and cycle track runs along Bure Valley Railway, and the River Bure from Aylsham to Wroxham. The route passes Brampton, Buxton and Coltishall with each having a station if you wish to rest your legs and take a trip on the railway. The Bure Valley Railway is Norfolk's longest fifteen inch gauge line. It opened on 10th July 1990, and the long distance footpath running parallel with it was opened a year later in 1991. It's a nice flat path which runs for about 9 miles. As such it makes for a leisurely stroll or an easy cycle ride. The long distance Rebellion Way passes along the route. The epic 232 mile circular ride visits some of the major highlights of Norfolk, using a series of quiet country lanes and traffic free paths.",
