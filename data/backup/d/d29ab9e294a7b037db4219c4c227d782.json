  "description": "Follow the walking trails around this beautiful nature reserve on the Suffolk Coast. The reserve is located on a remote shingle spit by the River Ore. It can be accessed by catching the National Trust ferry from Orford Quay (this is show on the google street view link below). You can then pick up the walking trails which take you to the WWI airfield, King's Marsh, Orford Ness lighthouse and Orford beach. There's three colour coded, waymarked trails to try with reserve features including shingle, salt-marsh, mud-flats and brackish lagoons. These areas are a haven for wildlife. Highlights include Orford's brown hares and the wonderful Chinese water deer who swam the river to reach the reserve.  Also look out for a wide variety of birds such as avocet and common tern. Marsh harrier's have a nest in King's Marsh and Barn Owls can also been seen nesting in the disused military buildings on the site. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the waterside footpath along the River Ore and River Alde and head north towards Aldeburgh Bay. The Suffolk Coast Path also runs near to the reserve. You can pick it up a couple of miles west of Orford where it runs along the Butley River to Boyton Marshes. Just to the north of the reserve you will find the village of Snape and the interesting Snape Maltings.  The area also includes an expansive arts complex on the banks of the River Alde. Rendlesham Forest is also nearby and has miles of nice woodland walking trails.",
