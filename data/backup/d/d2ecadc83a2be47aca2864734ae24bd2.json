  "description": "Visit these delightful woods in the Yorkshire Wolds on this short walk near Pocklington. The site consists of the best ancient ash woods in the Yorkshire Wolds. You can also enjoy carpets of bluebells, giant bellflowers and the scent of wild garlic. There's a nice surfaced walking trail running from the car park to a view point where you can admire a fine panoramic view across the treetops. The Minster Way and the Yorkshire Wolds Way both run past the woods so you could pick up these long distance footpaths to extend your walk. You could then explore the lovely Sylvan Dale and Millington Dale which are right next to the woods. You could actually reach the woods by following the Wolds Way from Pocklington. National Cycle Network Route 164 also runs to the woods from Pocklington so it's easy to cycle there too. There's also a car park just off Wood Gate Road at the southern end of the site.",
