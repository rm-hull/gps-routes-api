  "description": "This Cheshire based village is in a excellent position in the Goyt Valley on the edge of the Peak District. Several waymarked trails run through the village making it a popular choice for starting a walk. This circular walk from the village explores the expansive Lyme Park before heading to the Macclesfield Canal . The walk starts from Disley train station which you can reach from Manchester and Stockport. From here you can pick up the Gritstone Trail and follow it south east to Lyme Park, passing Bollinshurt Reservoir on the way. The route then heads south west across the park towards the house and the visitor centre. There's splendid views of the Peak District hills and the grand Lyme Hall as you make your way across the park. From the visitor centre you pick up trails heading west past the Knott to the canal. Follow the towpath north and it will meet with the Ladybrook Valley Interest Trail near Middlewood. You can follow this waymarked trail east to return to Disley village and the train station.",
