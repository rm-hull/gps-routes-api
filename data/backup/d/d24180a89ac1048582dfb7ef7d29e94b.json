  "description": "This attractive market town is located in the Vale of Glamorgan near to Cardiff and Bridgend. The town has a number of interesting independent shops and a pleasant riverside park to visit. In 2017, The Sunday Times crowned it the 'Best Place to Live in Wales'. This circular walk around the town visits the Physic Garden and the River Thaw. The walk starts at the Physic Garden in the town centre. Here you'll find a wonderful collection of medicinal plants and herbs, typical of physic gardens from centuries past. From here it is a short stroll down to the River Thaw which runs through the town. There's nice surfaced footpaths running along the picturesque tree lined river here. After exploring the park you can then turn around and follow alternative paths back through the town.",
