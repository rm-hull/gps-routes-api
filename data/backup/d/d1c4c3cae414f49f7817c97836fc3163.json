  "description": "This Cotswolds based village is located just south of Chipping Norton in the River Evenlode valley. Two popular waymarked walking trails run through the area and there's also a fine 17th century stone pub to relax in after your exercise. This circular walk uses sections of the Wychwood Way and the Oxfordshire Way to explore the surrounding countryside. The footpaths will first take you east towards Dean and Spelsbury before turning south to visit the River Evenlode. Here you can visit Catsham Bridge and enjoy some wonderful views of the Evenlode Valley. The route continues west along the river before returning to Chadlington via Greenend.",
