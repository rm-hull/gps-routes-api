This circular walk from the village takes you north along the River Wharfe on the Dales Way long distance footpath. At the stepping stones you can cross the river and then return along Burnsall Lane on the other side of the water. The walk could be extended by continuing north to the picturesque Linton Falls just outside neighbouring Grassington .",
