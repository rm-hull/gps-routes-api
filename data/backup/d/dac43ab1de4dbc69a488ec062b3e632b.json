The standing stone is located to the east of Barbury Castle, just below the ridge of Burderop Down, on the northern slopes below the wood. From here there are great views over the plains to the north of the downs. Closer inspection shows it to be concreted in place, and with two plaques mounted on it, as a memorial to Richard Jefferies and Alfred Williams, two local authors, and erected in 1939."
