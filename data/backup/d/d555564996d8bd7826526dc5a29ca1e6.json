  "description": "A nice little walk from the pretty Hampshire village of Chilbolton. The route takes you to the neighbouring village of Goodworth Clatford with nice views of the River Test and River Anton on the way. You can start the walk from the public car park in the village and pick up a footpath heading north west across Chilbolton Common where there are some pretty old thatch cottages. Here you cross the River Test near Wherwell before passing Wallis Bottom and coming to the River Anton. You then follow a footpath along the river taking you into Goodworth Clatford. There's a nice pub here where you could stop for refreshments before returning to Chilbolton.",
