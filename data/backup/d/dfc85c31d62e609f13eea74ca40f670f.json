  "description": "Follow the beautiful coastline of the Isle of Anglesey on the fabulous walk. The Isle of Anglesey Coastal Path falls within an  Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty covering 95% of the coast. It passes through landscape that includes a mixture of farmland, coastal heath, dunes, salt-marsh, foreshore, cliffs, woodland and a National Nature Reserve. Highlights on the route include the lovely Cemlyn Bay Nature Reserve with its shingle beach and pretty lagoon. It's a great place for wildlife spotting with various coastal birds to look out for. These include Ringed Plover, Arctic Terns, Oystercatcher and Shelduck. The colony of Sandwich terns is the third largest in the UK. The delightful Cemaes Bay is located close to the reserve and provides fine views over to the Isle of Man and the Lake District. Near the bay the path passes the Dinas Gynfor coastal hillfort, Llanlleiana Porcelain Works and the fascinating Porth Wen Brickworks . This scheduled ancient monument consists of a disused Victorian brickworks which produced fire bricks, made from quartzite (silica) used to line steel-making furnaces. The remains include a number of buildings and some of the machinery. It's a photgoenic spot with the coastal scenery making a wonderful backdrop to the old buildings. Also of note is the splendid Breakwater Country Park where you can climb Holyhead Mountain for wonderful views over the island. Also on Holyhead is the spectacularly positioned South Stack Lighthouse . You can descend the 400 steps to the island and enjoy fabulous views on the way. The area also includes the South Stack RSPB nature reserve where you can look out for puffins and porpoises. Trearddur Bay on Holy Island has two lovely beaches and is popular with divers and kayakers. Red Wharf Bay is  area of outstanding natural beauty located on the east coast of Anglesey. The coast path passes right along this expansive bay with its rock pools, beautiful beaches and pretty village. Just east of the bay the path takes you to Penmon Point where you can visit the Trwyn Du Lighthouse and enjoy wonderful views towards Puffin Island, Great Orme and Snowdon. Newborough Forest and Llanddwyn Island are located at the southern tip of the island near Malltraeth . The tidal island is a magical place with wonderful views across the Menai Strait, a 19th century lighthouse and an atmospheric ruined old chapel. Near here there's also the pretty village of Aberffraw and the adjacent Tywyn Aberffraw. This area of common land is one of the finest dune systems in the country.",
