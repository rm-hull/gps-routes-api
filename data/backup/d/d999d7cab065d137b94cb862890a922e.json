It has been preserved with this in mind in the style of the glory days of the monarchy before the First World War. It was opened in 1862 after Queen Victoria had purchased the site of Sandringham House as a Norfolk retreat. The station contained a set of elegant reception rooms, where several generations of the royal family and their visitors would wait for transportation to Sandringham House which lies a couple of miles to the east."

The station brought royal trains to the Sandringham Estate until it was closed in 1969 (the last royal train to call at the station was in 1966). It was reconstructed in 1898 at a cost of \u00a38,132 including the royal waiting rooms on the down platform. The company was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 until nationalisation on 1 January 1948 when split into the new British Railways' Eastern Region, North Eastern Region, and partially the Scottish Region. Wolferton was sold by British Rail to railwayman Eric Walker. He reopened the royal waiting room in 1970 as a museum until his death in 1985. In 2001, the station was sold to railway enthusiast Richard Brown who has undertaken significant restorations and returned much of Wolferton to its former glory and today (2017) visitors can still explore the platforms and other selected areas."

  "description": "This historic North Norfolk village includes a noteworthy old Royal rail station and a 13th century church. For walkers there's some nice trails in the adjacent woodland and bogland with the Royal residence of Sandringham House also nearby. This circular walk takes you to the nature reserve at Dersingham Bog and Wolferton Fen located to the east of the settlement. There's some nice nature trails here with woodland and lots of wildlife to see. The walk starts in the village where you can visit Wolferton Railway Station. The now disused station was well known during the 1800\u2019s through its association with the Royal Family who used the station because of its proximity to Sandringham House. Today there's a museum with lots of nostalgic memorabilia to admire. From the station you can head south east to pick up the trails exploring Sandringham Warren and the Dersingham Bogs. There's boardwalks here to follow over the bog which is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). You can extend the walk by heading east into the adjacent Sandringham Country Park where there are waymarked trails to follow around the expansive parkland.",
