  "description": "This walk visits the Wortham Ling Site of Special Scientific Interest\u00a0near the village of\u00a0Wortham\u00a0in Mid Suffolk . There's some pleasant countryside views and wildlife such as butterflies and rabbits to look out for here. Features at the site include grassland, heather, sandy knolls and gorse. This circular walk follows the waymarked 'Commons Walk' from the village to Wortham Ling. It runs for just under 6 miles through the area's historic commons, following a mixture of quiet country lanes and public footpaths. On the way look out for the noteworthy round tower church which dates back to the 12th century. It is located about a mile north of the village and worthy of investigation. The Angles Way long distance footpath also runs through the site so you could pick this up to extend your walk. The River Waveney flows just past the northern end of the site as well. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Wortham. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
