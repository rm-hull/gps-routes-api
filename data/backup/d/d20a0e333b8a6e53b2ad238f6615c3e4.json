The author Weston St. John Joyce, writing in\u00a0The Neighbourhood of Dublin\u00a0(1912), described the vista as \"a fine view is obtained of\u00a0Bray,\u00a0Howth,\u00a0Dalkey, and\u00a0Killiney, the vale of Shanganagh, and\u00a0Bray Head\u00a0and town. Between the observer and the sea will be seen\u00a0Loughlinstown, looking very closely built from this point, like the towns of medieval times, which were built within as small an area as possible, so as to reduce the circuit of the enclosing wall. To the westward will be seen the wooded hill of\u00a0Barnaslingan, forming the eastern side of\u00a0the Scalp, beyond that the\u00a0Two\u00a0and\u00a0Three Rock\u00a0Mountains, and south of these the higher Wicklow hills \u2013 War Hill,\u00a0Djouce, and\u00a0Duff Hill\""

  "description": "This circular walk visits Barnaslingan and Carrickgollogan Woods in the Dublin Mountains in\u00a0D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown. The two woods are located next to each other and include miles of walking and mountain bike trails. You can also enjoy a climb to Carrickgollogan Hill which stands at a height of 276 metres (906 feet). From here you can enjoy wonderful views over south Dublin and north\u00a0Wicklow. The area also includes some historic leadmines and a noteworthy ruined ancient church, with photos and more details below. Part of the route uses a section of the Dublin Mountains Way which you can use to further explore the area.",
