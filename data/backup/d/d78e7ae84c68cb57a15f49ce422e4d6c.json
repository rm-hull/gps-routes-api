It's a fine place for a walk with the long distance Cumbria Coastal Way, the wildlife rich Hodbarrow Lakes Nature Reserve and the neighbouring town of Millom to explore. This figure of eight loop walk first circles the Hodbarrow Lakes before heading along the coast path towards the sand dunes of Haverigg Bank. The route then heads inland to visit Kirkstanton before follow country lanes back to Haverigg. On the way there's scenic beaches and fine views towards the nearby mountains of the Lake District.",
