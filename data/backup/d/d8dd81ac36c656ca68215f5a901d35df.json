The heathland supports a diverse collection of heathers including the rare Cornish heath, a type unique to the area."

This view is towards Goonhilly 6, also known as \"Merlin\". It was built in 1985, for only 15 million pounds. It is the largest dish operating at the site (32 metres diameter) and for its size it is also the lightest. It is painted white to stop it heating up in the sun, with a paint that can resist the salty spray carried by the endless wind that blows across the Lizard peninsula. Its big claim to fame is that it carried the Live Aid Concert in 1985 to more than 2 billion people in about 100 countries, not long after it was installed."

  "description": "This walk explores a large area of heathland situated in the Lizard National Nature Reserve in Cornwall. The site is located next to the Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station, with its iconic satellite dishes\u00a0which can be seen for miles. The remains of RAF Drytree, a radar station built during WWII are also visible in the reserve. You can explore some interesting buildings including an air raid shelter and receiver block which you can climb to the top of for panoramic views on the surrounding countryside On the downs you will find areas of woodland, a large pond and interesting plants such as the Heath Spotted Orchid. Also look out for wildlife including ponies and deer as you make your way around the reserve. The walk starts from the car park on the B3293 at Traboe Cross. Start by following the paths west and then north to reach the Satellite Station, where you'll find a Bronze Age standing stone (menhir) next to the site. The impressive station is one of the largest communication stations in the world. The walk then crosses the downs to Croft Pascoe Forest where there are some nice woodland trails to try. You continue past the Croft Pascoe Pool before returning to the finish point back at the car park.",
