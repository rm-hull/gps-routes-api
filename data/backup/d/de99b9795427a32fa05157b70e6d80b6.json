  "description": "Enjoy a short circular walk around this National Trust owned estate near Cheltenham . The estate has nice footpaths taking you around the farmland and woodland of the estate, with great views across the surrounding Cotswolds countryside. In the park there is the 17th century Lodge Park Grandstand built by John Crump Dutton for entertaining his friends. There is also a lovely 19th-century fountain, a deer racing course, a Stone Age long barrow and nice views of the River Leach. You can virtually explore part of the estate using the google street view link below. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Sherborne Park where there are more nice walking trails to try.",
