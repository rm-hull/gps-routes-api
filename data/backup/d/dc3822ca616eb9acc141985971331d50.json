A group of 18th century merchants from Lancaster built Glasson Dock to import goods from the West Indies in 1746. Well-known cabinet makers Waring and Gillow started their business here by collecting mahogany dunnage used to protect cargoes arriving at Glasson, and using it to make furniture. The area includes businesses, residential settlements dating back to the early days of the Dock, with shops, seafaring public houses, and leisure craft marinas."

  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside stroll around the pretty Glasson Marina and Docks, on this easy circular walk. There's nice paths along the Glasson Branch of the Lancaster Canal and along the beautiful Lune Estuary. There's plenty of parking at the docks and a nice cafe where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. You can extend the walk by picking up the Lune Estuary Footpath which starts at the docks. Following it north takes you along the Lune into Lancaster. You can also pick up the Lancashire Coastal Way. Following it south will take you along Cockerham Sands to the historic Cockersand Abbey.",
