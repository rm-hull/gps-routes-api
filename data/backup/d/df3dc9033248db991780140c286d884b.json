  "description": "Climb to the highest point on Dartmoor on this splendid circular walk in the Dartmoor National Park. The walk starts at the car park at Meldon Reservoir and takes you to the 621\u00a0metres (2,039\u00a0ft)\u00a0summit via Longstone Hill and Black Tor. You start with a pleasant waterside section along the shores of the pretty Meldon Reservoir. It has a spectacular dam with wonderful views over the West Okement valley. You then leave the reservoir climbing Longstone Hill towards Black Tor with its strking Logan Stone and great views over Walkhampton Common. The route then heads to the summit of High Willhays where there are fabulous views over Dartmoor and Devon. From the summit you descend to the impressive Yes Tor. It is the second highest peak on Dartmoor just two metres below High Willlhays. The final section descends over Okehampton Common to the reservoir and the finish point. It's a challenging walk but on generally good paths and wonderful views as the reward. Also look out for Dartmoor Ponies as you go. If you'd like to continue your walk you could follow the footpath around Meldon Reservoir or try the climb to Yes Tor which starts from the same car park. There's also the Dartmoor Way and Granite Way which also run past the reservoir. You could start the walk from the nearby town of Okehampton by following the Granite Way to the reservoir.",
