  "description": "A circular walk from the Sussex village of Iford, visiting the River Great Ouse and the neighbouring villages of Southease and Rodmell. The village sits just a couple of miles south of Lewes on slopes of the South Downs in the valley of the River Ouse. The historic settlement includes 18 listed buildings, a 12th century church and a sundial marking the Greenwich meridian which runs through the village. This walk also makes use of a section of the South Downs Way National Trail which will take you up to Iford Hill to the west of the village. On this elevated section you can enjoy some splendid views over the surrounding area. In Rodmell you will pass the National Trust's Monk's House. The 16th-century weatherboarded cottage was once the home of author Virginia Woolfe and her husband, the political activist, journalist and editor Leonard Woolf. Here they received many visitors from the famous Bloomsbury Group, including T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, and Roger Fry.",

There's some fascinating ancient sites, pretty wildflowers, a variety of butterflies and tremendous views over the Weald from here. Falmer itself is also very attractive with its 17th century church, large pond and green which is ideal for picnics. Just to the west is the Castle Hill National Nature Reserve. The significant site includes chalk grassland with ancient settlements and lots of interesting flora and fauna to see."
