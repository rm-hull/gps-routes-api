  "description": "Keynsham is a Somerset market town located a few miles south east of Bristol. The town can be reached on foot from Bristol by following a riverside path from the city centre. There's also a train station if you prefer to come by public transport. It's about a 10 minute ride from Bristol Temple Meads. The attractive town is a nice place for a walk with lush countryside, river walks and a popular country park. This walk from the town visits the Avon Valley Country Park and the village of Upton Cheyney to the north east of the town. The walk starts at the train station at the northern edge of the town. From here you can pick up the River Avon Trail and follow the waymarked footpath east along the river to the associated country park. Cross to the other side on the footbridge and you can explore the park which includes country walks, a boating lake, play areas for children, a small petting zoo and a miniature railway. After exploring the park you return to the river and continue east to visit Upton Cheyney. From the village you can pick up the Monarch's Way and follow the waymarked trail west through the countryside, to the train station.",

      "content": "Another good option is to pick up the Two Rivers Way and follow the waymarked trail south from the town. It will take you along the River Chew to Chewton Keynsham and Compton Dando with lovely views of the Chew Valley countryside. The town is also near to Bath where you can try the Bath Canal Walk and the Bath Skyline Walk. The Community Forest Path also starts from the town. The circular Saltford Walk starts from the neighbouring village to the east of the town. You can enjoy waterside paths along the canalized section of the River Avon and pay a visit to the pretty Saltford Marina. The route also uses a section of the Bristol and Bath Railway Path, a shared cycling and walking trail which runs along a disused railway line. The village is also notable for its 12th century Manor House which claims to be the oldest continuously occupied dwelling in England.  A few miles north of the town there's a bit of a hidden gem at Wick Quarry. The quarry is now a popular place for walkers with the surrounding Golden Valley Nature Reserve great for wildlife and views of the River Boyd. Just to the north east there's Willsbridge Mill. The photogenic 18th century mill has an interesting history and nice trails along the Siston Brook. A couple of miles north west there's Hanham Woods and Conham River Park to explore. The two adjacent sites form part of the wider Avon Valley Woodlands Nature Reserve. For more walks in the county see the Somerset Walks page."
