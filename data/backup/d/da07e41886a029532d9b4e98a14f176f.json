  "description": "Keynsham is a Somerset market town located a few miles south east of Bristol. The town can be reached on foot from Bristol by following a riverside path from the city centre. There's also a train station if you prefer to come by public transport. It's about a 10 minute ride from Bristol Temple Meads. The attractive town is a nice place for a walk with lush countryside, river walks and a popular country park. This walk from the town visits the Avon Valley Country Park and the village of Upton Cheyney to the north east of the town. The walk starts at the train station at the northern edge of the town. From here you can pick up the River Avon Trail and follow the waymarked footpath east along the river to the associated country park. Cross to the other side on the footbridge and you can explore the park which includes country walks, a boating lake, play areas for children, a small petting zoo and a miniature railway. After exploring the park you return to the river and continue east to visit Upton Cheyney. From the village you can pick up the Monarch's Way and follow the waymarked trail west through the countryside, to the train station.",
