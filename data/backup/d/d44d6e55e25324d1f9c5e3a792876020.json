  "description": "Follow in the footsteps of Jonathan Dodgson Carr, Quaker visonary and founder of the Carr's breadmaker company in Cumbria. The walk runs from Kendal to Carlisle passing Shap Fells, Lowther Park and the River Lowther, Penrith, the Howgills, the Pennines and the Eden Valley. The walk includes long waterside sections along the River Lowther through Lowther Park to Penrith and then along the River Petteril from Penrith to Carlisle. Walk highlights include the 12th century Shap Abbey on the western bank of the River Lowther near the village of Shap. Also of interest is the splendid Lowther Castle and Gardens. Here you can explore the castle ruins and the beautiful grounds. The walk is waymarked with a green and white disc.",
