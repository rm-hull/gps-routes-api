Gallons of tea at a very fair price and delicious almond cake - well deserved whether you have climbed a Munro or not. Apart from a few scattered farms and cottages throughout the glen, the only real settlements are at Fortingall and here at Bridge of Balgie. Opposite the hamlet, on the south shore of the river Lyon, is the Meggernie Outdoor Centre which is run by the Scout Association. The glen contains several other small hamlets and has a primary school where Gaelic is taught weekly."

The post office inclues a nice tea room and garden area to relax in. From here you can pick up quiet country lanes heading south west through the glen. You'll enjoy great views of the river and surrounding mountains while also passing Stronuich Reservoir and several little waterfalls. Eventually you will come to Loch Lyon where there is an impressive dam and fine views over the water. You can continue your walking by ascending the munros of C\u00e0rn Gorm, Meall Garbh, C\u00e0rn Mairg and Creag Mh\u00f2r. See the video below for more details.",
