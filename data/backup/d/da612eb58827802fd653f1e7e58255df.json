  "description": "This walk follows the numerous trails on Highate Common - a designated country park and local nature reserve near Wolverhampton.  Here you will find 320 acres of lowland heath covered with heather, broom and gorse. There are also areas of woodland, with silver birch, pendunculate oak and coniferous plantation. Also look out for a variety of wildlife including lizards, Slow Worms, Grass Snakes, Rabbits, Bush-crickets, moths, beetles, flies, and Dragonflies. If you would like to continue your walk then the Staffordshire Way is a good option as it runs right through the park. The park is located a few miles south west of the city of Wolverhampton.",
