  "description": "This walk explores Rough Wood Country Park in Willenhall, Walsall. In the park you'll find a series of well maintained footpaths taking you around the attractive oak woodland with lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. The Wyrley and Essington Canal runs right past the southern portion of the park so it's easy to extend your walk if you have time. Heading west would take you toward Wolverhampton while heading east would take you to Pelsall Common Nature Reserve, Park Lime Pits in Walsall .",
