  "description": "This long distance circular route takes you through areas of the Yorkshire Dales associated with the vet and author James Herriot. The walk begins in the pretty village of Aysgarth in Wensleydale. Here you can admire the wonderful Aysgarth Falls before following the River Ure to Askrigg. The village was used as the fictional Darrowby in the BBC TV series All Creatures Great and Small, based on the books by James Herriot. Just above Askrigg you can visit the lovely Mill Gill and Whitfield Force Waterfalls. After leaving Askrigg you continue to the village of Hardraw where you will find the splendid Hardraw Force Waterfall. The waterfall is England's highest single drop waterfall, falling some 100ft. The route then heads to the market town of Hawes before climbing Great Shunner Fell. It is the highest point in Wensleydale and commands wonderful views over Ribblesdale to the south west and Swaledale to the north, as well as views into Cumbria and County Durham. You descend the mountain to Thwaite and then on to the village of Keld where you will find the beautiful Kisdon Force, East Gill and Catrake Force waterfalls. From Keld you continue across Gunnerside Moor, passing the beautiful valley of Gunnerside Gill. It's a lovely area with a fascinating lead mining history. You can still see several ruined buildings from the period including the remains of Blakethwaite Smelt Mill and the old mine offices. The walk continues east to Healaugh, passing along Mill Gill. You then follow the River Swale into Reeth. You continue to Castle Bolton passing through open moorland with lots of pretty heather. Here you'll find the fascinating 14th-century Bolton Castle and the pretty village of Redmire. The final section takes you back to Aysgarth, passing through more lovely Yorkshire Dales countryside.",
