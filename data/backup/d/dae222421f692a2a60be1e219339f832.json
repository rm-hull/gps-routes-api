Taken from the coastal path around High Holme, this shows Thornwick Nab, with its arch cut into the Chalk, jutting out to sea and stunning Great Thornwick Bay. Eventually the arch will collapse, leaving a pillar (stack) of chalk cut off from the rest of the headland. The beach shingle is predominantly of local flint and chalk, but there are numerous erratic rocks and pebbles released from the boulder clay (which overlies the Chalk) which has fallen/slipped on to the beach and been broken up by the sea. Large boulders of various types are also scattered over the beach."

  "description": "Follow the East Riding Heritage Way from the Humber Bridge to Filey on this trail through the East Yorkshire countryside. The walk starts with a section along the Humber Estaury from Hessle and heads to Beverley, with its wonderful minster. You continue to Driffield where there is a lovely waterside section along the Driffield Canal. The next stage then takes you to the coast and the seaside resort of Bridlington. The rest of the route then follows the spectacular East Yorkshire coastline, passing Bempton Cliffs with its huge seabird colonies, the lighthouse at Flamborough Head (video below) and the interesting cliff arch at Thornwick Bay before finishing at Filey.",
