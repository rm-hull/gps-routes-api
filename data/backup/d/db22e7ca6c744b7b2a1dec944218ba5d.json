The walk includes some challenging climbing through the Boleybrack Mountain range where you can enjoy some glorious views over the area. There's also some nice views of the Shannon River around Dowra. The route links up with the popular Shannon Blueway at Acres Lough. Here you can enjoy a stroll along Ireland\u2019s first floating walkway. For more details on the opening section of the route see the Drumshanbo to Leitrim Walk page.
