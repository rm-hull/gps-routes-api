  "description": "This short climb in the Yorkshire Dales visits Beamsley Beacon which is also known as Howber Hill. The local landmark is located close to the little village of Beamsley in the Craven district of North Yorkshire. You can start the walk from here and then follow a mixture of country lanes and public footpaths to the hill. The summit stands at a height of 326 metres (1,070 ft) and includes a number of  stone cairns, dating from the Bronze Age. From the peak there are splendid views over the surrounding hills and countryside including the nearby Chelker Reservoir. You can extend the walk by continuing on to Old Pike. Beamsley is located very close to the wonderful Bolton Abbey . You can extend your walk by following the nature trails along the River Wharfe and it's surrounding woodland. The Dales Way also passes through the area. You could visit the beacon from Ilkley by following the long distance trail along the river to Beamsley village. Our Beamsley Beacon Walk from Ilkley shows an alternative, more direct route to the sumit from the popular town. There are also public footpaths that will take you to Chelker Reservoir just to the west of the hill.",
