The trail follows much of the route of the dismantled Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line, which opened in 1855 and closed in 1967 as part of the railway cuts led by Richard Beeching, a local resident of East Grinstead and Chairman of the British Transport Commission. In 1977, West Sussex County Council purchased approximately four miles (6.4 km) of the disused line, mostly within the parish of Worth, and officially reopened it as a footpath and bridleway on 10 July 1979."

      "caption": "Path junction, Worth Way. The trail goes straight on in a deepening cutting to pass under the B2028, the turn left follows the edge of the cutting uphill to reach the B2028 on the level. The trail is managed by Crawley Borough Council for the section between Three Bridges and the M23, while West Sussex County Council oversees the remainder of the route. It is maintained through careful and sympathetic management aimed at preserving a balance of tree and shrub diversity. This involves coppicing, where trees and shrubs are cut back to their base on a rotating schedule, promoting regrowth that provides nesting habitats for birds. Open areas are regularly mown to prevent encroachment by scrub, creating ideal conditions for species that thrive in open environments, such as primroses and various insects. Additionally, the ditches along the route are important for both maintaining dry paths and supporting wildlife. The Crawley Down Pond is also a focal point for local environmental efforts. Originally started in 1999 by a small group of volunteers collecting litter, this environmental group has since grown, meeting monthly between September and May to carry out projects such as installing a new bank to prevent flooding. This management approach helps ensure the Worth Way remains a valuable habitat for wildlife while offering a well-maintained route for walkers and nature enthusiasts."

The road goes to Rowfant Business Centre, formerly a brickworks. The trail is now designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Over time, the former railway cuttings and embankments have transformed into rich woodland, with trees like silver birch, ash, hazel, and sallow establishing themselves. This habitat is especially beneficial for wildlife, supporting over 200 species of insects, butterflies such as the brimstone, white admiral, and meadow brown, and a variety of birds like the nuthatch and chiffchaff."

On the trail you can look out for reptiles including adders, grass snakes, and the common lizard. Roe deer and foxes thrive in the adjoining farmland. The kingfisher has even been spotted at Crawley Down Pond, and bats can be seen near dusk. The Worth Way's transformation into a thriving wildlife corridor highlights its ecological importance to the area."

However, due to cutting infill further east, including the blocking of the route by the M23 motorway, the cycle route leaves the old railway at this point for around a mile."

In the summer of 1999, the Worth Way trail underwent resurfacing to enable its integration into the Sustrans National Cycle Network. Contractors Edburtons laid a 2.5m wide path using a combination of natural materials to accommodate walkers, cyclists, and horse riders. This project, which lasted for eight weeks, cost \u00a3300,000 and was jointly funded by West Sussex County Council, Mid Sussex County Council, the National Lottery Millennium Fund, and Eurobell (now Virgin Media), the latter of which contributed funds in exchange for laying telecommunications cables under the path. The works were completed alongside the final section of the Worth Way at Station Hill near Three Bridges station, creating a new connection with the Forest Way trail at Herontye Drive in East Grinstead. This link extended Route 21 of the National Cycle Network, connecting London, Reigate, and Gatwick Airport with East Grinstead, Heathfield, and Eastbourne. This project improved the accessibility of the Worth Way for multiple users and reinforced its place as part of a wider cycling and walking infrastructure in the region."
