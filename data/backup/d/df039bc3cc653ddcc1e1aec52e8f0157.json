  "description": "This long distance trail follows the River Annan from the Devil's Beef Tub near Moffat to the point where there river empties into the Solway Firth. The route starts off in Moffat and begins with a circuit around the Devil's Beef Tub to the north of the town. Here you can visit the source of the River Annan and enjoy some fine views over the valley. The walk then heads south branching out to either Lochmaben or Lockerbie. The route below follows the section to Lochmaben but the walk is mapped on the OS maps so you can see the other section here. The final section includes a lovely riverside stretch into the town of Annan before finishing near Bankirk Point and Newbie on the coast. Here you can link up with the Powfoot Beach Walk and enjoy a stroll along the Solway Firth to the little village of Powfoot.",
