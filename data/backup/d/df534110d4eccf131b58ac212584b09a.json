  "description": "Follow the circular Conwy Falls Walk through this beautiful wooded gorge near Betws-y-Coed. The walk starts from the car park and cafe located just off the A5 where it meets the B4406. You then pick up the trail through the woodland to the River Conwy where you will find the lovely falls. Here the river drops 50 feet (15 m) into a deep pool. It's a short, easy walk with a number of good viewpoints. You can refresh yourself in the good sized cafe after your walk. To extend your walk you can pick up a footpath along the river to Fairy Glen. Here you will find little waterfalls, rapids and cascades chanelled into a narrow ravine on the River Conwy. It's a delightful place and is only about a mile up river from Conwy Falls. Also nearby are the wonderful Swallow Falls and the picturesque Miners Bridge. These can be reached from Betws-y-Coed by following the Afon Llugwy to the falls. It's a lovely riverside walk, with woodland trails and a series of waterfalls to enjoy.",
