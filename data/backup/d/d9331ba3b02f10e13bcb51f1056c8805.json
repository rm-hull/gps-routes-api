The peaty brown water of the River Rivelin flows into the River Loxley and then the River Don, or Dun as it was once called, named after the colour of the water."

  "description": "This walk takes you through the lovely Rivelin River valley in Sheffield. The nature trail runs along the side of the rushing river which is surrounded by attractive woodland. Along the way you'll pass a series of weirs, and little waterfalls with a variety of interesting flora and fauna. The walk starts at the car park off the Rivelin Valley Road and picks up the waterside trail to the pretty Rivelin Park. The park has a cafe, toilets and play area. You then follow the riverside path for about 2.5 miles with pretty ponds and stepping stones to look out for on the way. The area has a rich milling history with a series of dams and wheel pits dotted along the route. To extend your walking in the area you can head east to the pretty Rivelin Dams . Here you can pick up a delightful waterside trail through the Wyming Brook Nature Reserve. This will lead you to the Redmires Reservoirs . These three interestingly shaped reservoirs have a great circular walking trail with woodland paths, climbs across the Peak District Moors and a wide variety of wildfowl and waders to look out for on the water.",
