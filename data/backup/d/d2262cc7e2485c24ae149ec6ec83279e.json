  "description": "This walk visits the splendid Alport Heights viewpoint near Belper and Wirskworth in Derbyshire. The walk starts from the Alport Heights car park which you can find at postcode DE56 2DQ for your sat navs. It's located just a few miles south east of Wirksworth. From here you can pick up a circular trail taking you around the hill top. On the summit you will find a 20ft high pillar of gritstone known as the Alport Stone. There's excellent views towards the Peak District hills as well. It's a good spot for wildlife spotting too with Kestrels often seen hunting around the hill. The Ecclesbourne Way runs just to the west of the hill, providing an opportunity for extending your walk. This long distance walking trail follows the route of the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway from Duffield to Wirksworth. The route passes several of the stations on the route and offers fine views of the surrounding countryside as well.",

The site includes the Shottle Farm Brewery and a pub located on a 60 acre working farm in the little village of Shottle. The farmhouse here dates back to 1793 with lots of animals to see such as Aberdeen Angus X Shorthorn cows, goats, pigs and a herd of black cats. The associated pub includes several original features with exposed stone walls, a sloping concrete floor with cocks foot prints and massive steel beams holding up the grain floor. It's full of character and has a cosy fire for colder days. They do good home cooked food and have an excellent selection of ales from their own brewery. You can find them at a postcode of DE56 2DT for your sat navs."
