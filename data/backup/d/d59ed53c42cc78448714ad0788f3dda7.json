  "description": "A splendid walk from Howtown climbing to Hallin Fell on the southern side of Ullswater. From the fell summit there are fabulous views of the lake and surrounding fells of the Martindale Valley. Start the walk from Howtown pier where the ferry boats dock on the southern side of the lake. Head west along the lakeshore towards Waternook before turning south west. You can then follow paths north to the 388 m (1,273 ft) summit of Hallin Fell. Here you will find a grassy top with a number of small knolls, some outcropping rock and an obelisk. It's a splendid spot with tremendous views over Martindale Common, High Street, Helvellyn, Blencathra and Ullswater. After taking in the views the route then descends on other paths before returning to the pier. If you would like to turn it into a longer circular walk then you could head towards Sandwick Bay and head through Hallinhag Wood, before returning along the lakeshore. To extend your walking in the area try the Howtown to Glenridding Walk which is considered the finest lakeside walk in the Lake District. This follows a section of the Ullswater Way long distance trail. You could also follow the trail north to visit Pooley Bridge.",
