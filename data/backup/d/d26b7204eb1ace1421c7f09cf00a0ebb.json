  "description": "Enjoy a nice riverside walk from Shawford to Winchester on this easy route in Hampshire. It's about a 3 mile walk using a series of good surfaced paths along the River Itchen and the Itchen Navigation. You can return on the same paths or catch the train back from Winchester if you prefer. The walk starts from Shawford train station and follows the waymarked Itchen Way north along the River Itchen. You'll pass Hockley Golf Course and the noteworthy St Catherine's Hill. You could take a small detour from the route and enjoy fine views over Winchester from the summit. It's a very pretty area with the chalk downland covered in wild flowers including bird's-foot trefoil, salad burnet, dropwort and several types of orchid. Soon after passing the hill the route enters the outskirts of Winchester before finishing at the famous cathedral.",
