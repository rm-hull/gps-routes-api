  "description": "The Cumbrian town of Sedbergh is a good base for walkers with direct access to the Howgill Fells. It sits on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and has been officially recognised as Walkers are Welcome town. This circular walk takes you along the River Rawthey and into the countryside surrounding the town. There's wonderful views of the fells and of the River Rawthey and River Dee. The walk uses a section of the long distance Dales Way to take you west along the river for just over a mile. Just after Brigflatts you cross the river and turn east towards Abbot Holme where you cross the River Dee. At Millthrop you cross the Rawthey, passing a weir before returning to the town centre. Sedbergh is handily placed for exploring the Howgill Fells. You could extend your walking in the area by heading north along the Dales High Way and climbing The Calf, the highest point in the range. Around here you can also visit England's highest (cascade) waterfall above ground at Cautley Spout. These walks pass several of the Howgill Fells with wonderful views over the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The long distance Dales Way also passes through the town. You could pick up the trail and follow it south east along the River Dee to Dentdale.",

Near here there's the remote and pretty village of Barbon where you can try the Barbon Beck Barbondale Walk. The little village includes a noteworthy 17th century pub as well. A few miles to the north there's the nearby village of Tebay where you will find riverside trails along the River Lune. The village is also known for its 16th century pub and the Tebay Motorway Services."
