  "description": "Enjoy walks and mountain bike trails in these woods in the village of Esholt near Shipley. There's a car park at the western end of the woods, just north of the village. From here you can pick up the trails heading east through Jerrison Wood and Spring Wood. For mtb riders there's some nice short trails with jumps, berms and one or two technical features to try. Other highlights include pretty bluebells in the spring and a path along the Guiseley Beck in the eastern end of the woods. The River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal run just to south of the woods so you could pick up the walking and cycling trails along these waterways to extend your exercise. A few miles west of the woods you will find Baildon Moor which has miles of cycling and walking trails. It also commands great views of Bradford and Leeds from its elevated position.",

There's some pretty old cottages, a historic church, pleasant riverside walks and the Woolpack Pub to visit. The village is famous for being the original setting for Emmerdale with the Woolpack used as the local frequented by the characters. The charming interior includes photographs depicting characters from the soap and scenes of the village from days gone by. They serve good quality pub grub and also have a garden area for warmer weather. You can find them on the Main Street at postcode BD17 7QZ for your sat navs."
