  "description": "This delightful circular walk in the Cotswolds visits the pretty village of Miserden and explores Misarden Park with its pretty lake and woodland trails. The walk starts in Miserden with its lovely Cotswold stone cottages, St Andrews Church, Village Hall, Post Office, Shop and Pub. From the village it is a short stroll to Misarden Gardens where you will find a 17th century Manor House surrounded by attractive topiary, a walled garden, herbaceous borders, specimen trees and a parterre. There is a nice waymarked footpath leading through the woodland and along the pretty lake with views of the River Frome. You can extend your walk by following a bridleway east through the woods to Winstone or heading south east through the countryside to Duntisbourne Abbots. The village of Edgeworth lies just to the south and the Macmillan Way long distance trail can be picked up near here.",
