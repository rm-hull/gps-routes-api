The castle was then destroyed by William II but rebuilt. It then became embroiled in the civil wars of the thirteenth century when the de Clares rebelled against both King John and his successor, Henry III. The castle was slighted on the orders of Parliament in 1646. The site is also the start of a 6-mile cycle ride to Penshurst Place called The Tudor Trail."

  "description": "Travel through the beautiful Eden Valley and the High Weald on this 15 mile walk through Kent. The route starts at Edenbridge and heads towards Hever and the excellent Hever Castle with its double-moated castle and 125 acres of spectacular gardens. You continue east passing the delightful village of Chiddingstone. This National Trust owned village includes a number of quaint timber framed Tudor buildings, a picturesque village pond, an ancient pub and the 15th century Chiddingstone Castle with its beautiful grounds and gardens. A small detour north from the route at Hill Hoath will take you to the worthy settlement. The next stage takes you to Penshurst and the 14th century Penshurst Place. Again there is plenty to see here including the State Rooms, Gallery and wonderful gardens. The final section heads to Tonbridge passing through the Haysden Country Park and Barden Lake before finishing at the castle in Tonbridge. This is a lovely walk through the open fields, woodland and parks of the Eden Valley with the added bonus of some impressive historical architecture. It's waymarked with a yellow disc with the name of the walk and a castle logo.",
