  "description": "This pretty nature reserve is located on the River Yare near Cringleford and Norwich. The reserve includes pleasant riverside trails, 5 ponds, damp woodland and floodplain grazing marsh with cattle. It's great for wildlife watching with species such as water voles, otters, snipe and geese to look out for. There's a car park at the eastern end of the site where you can pick up a waymarked circular nature trail running for just under 2 miles. The Yare Valley Walk starts/finishes at the reserve. You could pick up this 6 mile trail and follow it north to the man made broad in the pleasant grounds of the University of East Anglia.",
