The reserve is great for wildlife with woodpeckers, goshawks, treecreepers and redstarts to look out for. The reserve includes good facilities with a Visitor centre, viewing hides, two waymarked trails, a picnic area, information boards and a large car park, just to the north west of the village of Parkend. On the northern side of the reserve you could pay a visit to Cannop Ponds. There's a nice waterside circular route here with lots more wildlife to look out for.",

There's an attractive interior and a lovely courtyard area outside for warmer days. You can find them just east of the reserve car park at postcode GL15 4JF. There's also The Fountain Inn. The inn was built over 200 years ago and then extended when the Severn and Wye Railway reached the village in 1875. There's some interesting local items on display in this historic pub."

There's also the 'Roll of Honour' sculpture and the Geomap - a map you can walk on showing the underlying geology of the forest. A car park and picnic area add to the attraction. In Parkend you could pick up the Dean Forest Railway and enjoy a ride on one of the splendid heritage steams trains. You can find the station and the informative railway centre about a mile east of the car park."
