  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Mercia Marina in Willington, Derbyshire. It's Europe's largest inland marina and a great place for strolls and wildlife watching. You can start the walk from Willington Station where it's just a short walk to the Trent and Mersey Canal which you can follow to the marina. The marina is very attractive with lots of barges and birds to look out for on the water. Keep your eyes peeled for swans, coot, moorhen, cormorant and gadwall. You can also see otters and variety of butterflies fluttering around in the summer months. The marina have devised 3 circular walks starting from the marina, with each one going around the neighbouring villages of Findern, Willington & Repton. See the link below for more details. After your walk there's a number of nice cafes where you can enjoy refreshments with views over the water. The marina is located close to the city of Derby so you could follow the canal from there to the site. Burton Upon Trent and the lovely Branston Water Park are also just a short walk away.",
