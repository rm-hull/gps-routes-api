  "description": "Visit Ponden Reservoir and Ponden Hall on this lovely walk in Bronte country. The hall is said to be the inspiration for Thrushcross Grange, the home of the Linton family in Wuthering Heights. You can follow footpaths from the nearby village of Stanbury to the reservoir. You can follow the Pennine Way along the southern side of the water before heading along a nice country lane on the northern side. It's a lovely spot with the reservoir surrounding by attractive moorland scenery and the Pennine Hills. To extend your walk you could head south and visit the Bronte Waterfall and Top Withens . The ruined farmhouse is said to have been the inspiration for\u00a0Wuthering Heights. You could also pick up the Bronte Way and follow it west towards Watersheddles Reservoir and Dove Stones Moor. Heading east will take you into Haworth via Lower Laithe Reservoir in Penistone Hill Country Park .",
