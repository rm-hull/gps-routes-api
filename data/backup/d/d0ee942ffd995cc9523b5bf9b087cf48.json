It enjoys a lovely setting in West End, a hamlet with little more than a few residential streets and a local farm shop, Garson\u2019s, where you can buy local produce and pick your own fruit and vegetables during the summer months. A large pretty green and duck pond are also just 30 metres away from the pub\u2019s front doors. You can find the pub at 48 West End Lane with a postcode of KT10 8LA for your sat navs."

One is at Blackhills just off the A307/Portsmouth road, less then half a mile beyond Claremont landscape gardens on your way to Cobham. There's space for about 20+ cars and it can be found at a postcode of KT10 9JL. There's another slighlty smaller one at Winterhouse Farm at postcode KT10 8LT. Garsons Farm Shop is located very close to the common. The award-winning Garden Centre and Farm Shop is a lovely place to stroll around for a couple of hours. There's also a nice restaurant which offers an alternative to the pub mentioned above. The Oxshott Walk visits the common from the train station in the nearby village. It also visits Oxshott Heath and Woods and Fairmile Common. Oxshott is also notable as being one of the most expensive places to live in the country. Residents include several premier league footballers and tennis player Andy Murray."
