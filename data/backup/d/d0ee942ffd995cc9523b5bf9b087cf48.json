  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this large open space in Surrey. There are miles of peaceful woodland footpaths and a nice off road cycle track. The route will take you to two large ponds and the nearby Fairmile common. The common is a local nature reserve so look out for a variety of wildlife. If you would like to continue your exercise why not visit the nearby Claremont Park with its beautiful landscaped gardens and the adjacent West End Common. To the south east there's also miles trails around Ashtead Common National Nature Reserve and Epsom Common .",
