The castle sits in an elevated position above the village with wonderful views over the surrounding Staffordshire countryside and the Cheshire Plain. The 18th century folly is a well know landmark positioned 355m above sea level and visible for miles around. The walk also visits the Old Man of Mow - an interesting 65ft rock formation just to the north of the castle. Near here is a triangulation pillar and more great views to enjoy. Mow Cop is on the Gritstone Trail so you can extend your walk by continuing along this long distance trail.",
