  "description": "Enjoy waterside footpaths along the New Bedford River on this easy circular walk at the Welney Wetland Centre. It's a unique place with freshwater grazing marshland and a huge variety of birdlife to look out for. The area is known as the Ouse Washes covering the area between two diversion channels of the River Great Ouse: the Old Bedford River and the New Bedford River. There's nice grassy paths and boardwalks making it a great place for walkers as well as wildlife enthusiasts. You can start your walk from the car park and visitor centre on Station Road. Then pick up the trails heading west along the New Bedford River. The walk then crosses the bridge to the village of Welney and picks up the trail along the Old Bedford River. You cross again before returning to the car park. The area is fantastic for bird watching so be sure to bring your binoculars. Birds you may see include Grey heron, Little egret, Black-tailed godwit, Lapwing, Avocet, Oystercatcher, Coot and Moorhen. The Hereward Way long distance trail crosses the reserve so you can pick up the trail to extend your walk. Heading south west will take you along the river towards Little Downham. Heading north west takes you towards March. Heading north east along the river will take you towards Downham Market where you can pick up the Fen Rivers Way and enjoy a walk along the River Great Ouse.",
