  "description": "Follow a mixture of well surfaced and unsurfaced cycling and walking trails around this large reservoir in Stutton, Ipswich . The reservoir is surrounded by lovely countryside and includes a butterfly garden, woodland, a wildflower meadow, ponds and a bird hide. It's a great place for wildlife watching. Look out for golden eye, wigeon, pochard, teal and shoveller. There is also a visitor centre at the start of the route where you can hire bikes. The lake is located close to Constable Country and the Dedham Vale AONB. You can extend your walking in the area by visiting Flatford Mill on the River Stour where Constable painted some of his most famous works. His birthplace at East Bergholt is also nearby and well worth visiting. The Suffolk Coast Path also passes the southern end of the reservoir so you can pick up this long distance trail to further explore the area.",
