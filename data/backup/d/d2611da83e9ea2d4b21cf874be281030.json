  "description": "Follow the Brighton to Newhaven clifftop path on this splendid coastal walk on the south coast. Much of this route follows a traffic free path along National Cycle Network route 2 so you can bring your bike too. Part of the route also passes the popular Undercliff Walk Brighton from the marina at Black Rock to Saltdean. This follows a nice surfaced path along the sea wall with great views of the white cliffs and the sea. Much of the rest of this walk is on an elevated clifftop trail with splendid coastal views. It's about a 9 mile walk but fairly flat throughout. The walk starts on the front in Brighton and heads east to the Brighton Marina where you pick up the sea wall path. This takes you to Saltdean where you will pass the impressive Saltdean Lido. You continue to Telscombe Cliffs where there's a fine cliff top path and pub. Near here are the outskirts of Peacehaven where the cycle route turns inland but you can continue along the cliff top if you are on foot. At Peacehaven you will pass the Greenwich Meridian monument marking the site where the Greenwich meridian crosses the English south coast. The final section takes you past Peacehaven Heights, Harbour Heights and the 19th century Newhaven Fort (video below) before finishing at Newhaven Harbour. At Newhaven the walk links with two long distance walking trails. You can pick up the Sussex Ouse Valley Way and follow it north along the River Ouse to Piddinghoe if you would like to extend your walk. You could also follow the Vanguard Way further along the coast to Seaford. You can virtually explore the part of the path around the Peacehaven Greenwich Meridian Monument using the google street view link below.",
