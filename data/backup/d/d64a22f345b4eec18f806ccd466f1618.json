  "description": "This walk explores the ruins of a former Cistercian monastery on the River Aire in Leeds. There's some nice paths to follow around the grounds of the 12th century abbey with views of the River Aire and woodland trails to enjoy on the way. There's also a visitor centre with interactive exhibits where you can find out about the lives of the monks who made the abbey their home. You'll also learn about the history of the site which was constructed in 1152 and is now a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. You can start your walk from the large free car park situated next to Abbey House Museum on Abbey Walk. Entrance to the ruins is also free. To continue your walking in the area you can pick up the Leeds Canal Walk which takes you along the Leeds & Liverpool Canal into the city centre. On the way you can visit the nearby Kirstall Valley Nature Reserve and the Rodley Nature Reserve where there are more nice trails and lots of wildlife to see.",

It features unique makers and producers from Leeds and the surrounding areas. If you pick up the canal towpath you could head west and visit Calverley Woods. The woods have a network of footpaths and mountain bike trails and include bluebell woodland, an old walled garden and hidden grottoes. Just west of the abbey you can visit the attractive Horsforth Hall Park where there is a lovely Japanese Garden to see.
