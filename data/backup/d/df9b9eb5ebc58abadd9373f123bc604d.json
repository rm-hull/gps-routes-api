There's also the 13th century priory church which includes a notable rood screen with medieval saints overpainted with Protestant texts. After exploring the extensive monastic ruins the circular walk vists Binham Ford and the Main Street in the village. You can start and finish the walk at the car park at the priory. On the way there are some nice views of the surrounding countryside to enjoy.",
