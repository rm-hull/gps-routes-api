      "content": "There's lots of great canalside pubs to relax in on your walk. On the canal near Kingswood you will find the the Navigation Inn which has a lovely canalside beer garden to relax in. You can find at postcode B94 6NA. Near here on the Stratford Canal, just to the east of the village of Lapworth you will find the Boot Inn which has another fine beer garden for the summer months. The village of Stoke Bruerne has some good options for canalside refreshments. The Boat Inn is located right next to the canal, opposite the interesting Canal Museum where you can enjoy an audio guide taking you on a journey through the stories and traditions of Britain's historic canals. The pub has been owned and operated by the Woodward family since 1877 when it formed part of the Duke of Grafton's 'Wakefield' estate. In those early days, the inn was run in conjunction with the family's other businesses - the local butchery, bakery, smallholding and working narrowboats. The Boat Inn is believed to be the longest running family pub, that has maintained the same family name throughout (140+ years), and is therefore claimed to be the longest lineage of licensee in the country. The Navigation is another delightful country pub in a gorgeous setting overlooking the Grand Union Canal in the village. Find a spot on the patio and watch the narrow boats negotiate the locks with a pint of real ale. Near Milton Keynes in Cosgrove there's the noteworthy Barley Mow. Housed in a lovely 17th Century building the pub boasts a large beer garden to relax in during the summer months. You'll also pass the notweworthy Cosgrove aqueduct here. The cast iron trough structure carries the Grand Union Canal over the River Great Ouse, just to the south east of the village. At Batchworth Lock in Rickmansworth you can enjoy some refreshments at the Cafe at Lock 81. They have a variety of sandwiches, hot food, hot and cold drinks, chocolate, crisps and sweets. There's also the adjacent Canal Centre with a wealth of information and the excellent Little Union Canal. This miniature working model canal shows how a lock and canal works. You can find the cafe at 99 Church Street with a postcode of WD3 1JJ for your sat navs. The cafe is also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."
