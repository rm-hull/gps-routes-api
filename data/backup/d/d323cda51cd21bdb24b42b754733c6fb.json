  "description": "This area of East London is a nice place to start a few walks with the train station the terminus of a line from Liverpool Street station. Epping Forest is right next to the town and there's also some nice walks along the River Lea to the west. This walk from Chingford uses part of the Epping Forest Centenary Walk to explore some of the walking highlights of the area. On the route you'll visit Connaught Water, Highhams Park and Wanstead Flats. The walk starts from Chingford train station and heads east past Queen Elizabeth's Hunting Lodge. This Grade II listed former hunting lodge, is now a museum, on the edge of Epping Forest. It was built in 1543 for King Henry VIII and now provides an insight into Tudor history in the area. From the lodge you head north west to visit Magpie Hill and Connaught Water. This pretty lake has a nice trail to follow around the perimeter where you can look out for a variety of wildlife on the water. After rounding the little lake you head south to Warren Pond with views of the River Ching on the way. It is notable as the river that gives Chingford its name. After a couple of miles you will come to The Highams Park where there is a boating lake surrounded by trees. It's another peaceful and pleasant spot on the trail. The trail continues south passing the Rodney Smith memorial and Hollow Pond before coming to Wanstead Flats. The Flats are a lovely place for a stroll with open grassland, wildflowers and a lovely pond to enjoy. After exploring the Flats you can return to Chingford on the same paths.",
