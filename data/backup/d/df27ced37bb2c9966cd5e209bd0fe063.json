  "description": "This is a short walk around the fascinating medieval Pembroke Castle. It's an attractive area with the castle surrounded by a large Mill Pond. This walk starts near the castle at a parking area in the town and explores the castle grounds before crossing the mill pond bridge for a great view across the water to the castle. You can return the same way or head through the town. Here you can explore Pembroke Dock and enjoy a walk along the River Pembroke to the Daugleddau estuary. To continue your walk you can pick up the Pembrokeshire Coast Path which runs past the castle. Following it north will take you to Neyland and then on to Milford Haven .",

      "content": "Just to the east of the town you can continue your historical walking with a visit to Carew Castle. The noteworthy site includes the only restored tidal Mill in Wales and one of just five in the UK. Near here you can pick up the Lawrenny Quay Walk and enjoy riverside walking along the Cresswell River and the Daugleddau River. The epic Landsker Borderlands Trail also passes through the area. Head south west and you can visit Freshwater West where there's a lovely beach with sand dunes and rock pools. There's also a fine circular walk around Angle Bay and the village of Angle starting from here."
