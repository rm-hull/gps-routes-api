From here you can see Hengistbury Head near Christchurch Harbour."

Water from Sturt Pond is channelled along the back of the pebble bank (from the right) and out into the marshes behind Hurst Spit (off to the right) where it is called Mount Lake. The many children and parents on the bridge are crabbing. Some bigger scale sea angling takes place on the seawards side of the spit, but it's not particularly safe for children due to the undertow."

Behind them are the Pennington Marshes, and a large herd of cattle gathered alongside the water, where the sea breeze across the water helps them to keep cool in the afternoon sun (and probably reduces the number of annoying flies). A gate further along the sea wall (towards Keyhaven) prevents the cattle from straying off the nature reserve and onto the public roads."

  "description": "This Hampshire based coastal village is a lovely place for a walk. There's a village green, a lovely beach, a good selection of shops and cafes, and fine views over the Solent to the Isle of Wight and The Needles. This walk from the village takes you to some of the local highlights including Hurst Castle Spit, Keyhaven Marshes and the neghbouring town of Lymington. The walk starts on the sea front in the town, where there are a number of public car parks. From here you can pick up the Solent Way and follow the waymarked footpath south east along the coast to Sturt Pond and Hurst Castle. The striking coastal structure is an artillery fort established by Henry VIII between 1541 and 1544. The route then returns to the coastal path where you continue east to the Keyhaven Marshes. There's a lovely walking and cycling trail here heading along the sea wall. On one side there's views of the Isle of Wight while on the other there's the marshes where you can see a wide variety of birdlife. The route continues north east through Pennington Marshes, Oxey Marsh, The Salterns, Normandy and Waterford where you will pass through the pretty marina. Soon after you arrive at Lymington where you can catch the ferry over to the Isle of Wight.",

The exquisite house was built for Alexander Siemens (who created the world\u2019s first public electricity supply at Godalming) as a summer house for his family. Outside there's a wonderful large garden area where you can enjoy splendid coastal views with your meal. You can find them on Park Lane at postcode SO41 0PT for your sat navs."
