  "description": "This super country park in Leyland is perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll. The park covers 150 acres and includes formal gardens overlooked by a wonderful conservatory with an accompanying maze. There are also woodlands, a duck pond, a folly, a water cascade, a mininiture railway, the 18th Century domed icehouse and waterside trails along the Shaw Brook which runs through the park. The park is located just half a mile south of Leyland town centre in Lancashire. There's a good sized car park at the site or you could walk from Leyland train station which is about a mile or so north of the site.",

It's located in a historic spot in the Old Town in front of the iconic Leyland Cross and behind the 1000-year-old Parish Church. They serve good quality food which you can enjoy in the garden area if the weather is good. You can find them on Worden Lane with postcode PR25 3EL for your sat navs."

There's also the Chorley Canal Walk and an alternative Chorley Walk to try here. Just to the east there's Cuerden Valley Park where there's a good cycling and walking trail to try. You can also visit the village of Whittle Le Woods at the southern end of the park. In Leyland you could visit the interesting South Ribble Museum and Exhibition Centre. Here you can learn all about the history of the area including the famous Leyland Motors which operated from the town. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lancashire Walks page."
