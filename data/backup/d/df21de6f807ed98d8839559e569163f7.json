  "description": "This super country park in Leyland is perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll. The park covers 150 acres and includes formal gardens overlooked by a wonderful conservatory with an accompanying maze. There are also woodlands, a duck pond, a folly, a water cascade, a mininiture railway, the 18th Century domed icehouse and waterside trails along the Shaw Brook which runs through the park. The park is located just half a mile south of Leyland town centre in Lancashire. There's a good sized car park at the site or you could walk from Leyland train station which is about a mile or so north of the site.",
