  "description": "Follow the Middlewood Way - a lovely off road cycle and walking path running from Macclesfield to Marple and passing by the Macclesfield Canal. The route runs along the track of the old Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple railway which closed in 1970. It covers a distance of about 11 miles on a flat resurfaced path suitable for most types of bike. As such its a nice easy ride suitable for most abilities and ideal for families looking for a safe ride in the area.",
