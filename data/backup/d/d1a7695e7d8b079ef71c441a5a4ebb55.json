  "description": "This former coal mining village is located north of the Mendip Hills in Somerset. There's some nice local woodland and country trails with waterside paths along the Cam Brook River which flows just to the north. This walk from the village takes you to the nearby Greyfield Woods. On the way there's nice country views of the Cam Brook valley to enjoy. You can reach the woods from the village by picking up the Limestone Link just to the north. Then follow it north west past Hallatrow to the site. The pretty woods have some nice walking trails, bluebells in the spring and a picturesque waterfall to admire. You could extend the walk by continuing on to Clutton.",
