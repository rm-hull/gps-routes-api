  "description": "Travel through the Essex countryside from Epping to Harwich on this 81 mile footpath. The path takes you through some interesting towns and delightful villages, including Chipping Ongar, Terling, Willingale, Pleshey, Coggeshall, Dedham and Mistley. The walk includes riverside sections along the River Blackwater, the River Colne and along the River Stour at the end of the route. This final section is particularly lovely passing Manningtree and the Wrabness Nature Reserve on the banks of the river Stour estuary. Here you can see owls, yellowhammers, whitethroats, turtle dove, song thrush, nightingales and bullfinches. The walk is waymarked with a white disc featuring poppies.",
