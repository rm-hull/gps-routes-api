  "description": "This wonderful riverside trail follows a disused railway line and the River Camel from Padstow to Poley's Bridge. You start by Padstow's lovely harbour near the delightful Prideaux Place with its deer park and gardens. You then follow the trail along the Camel estuary to the market town of Wadebridge which is an ideal place to stop for refreshments. The path continues towards Bodmin before a pleasant wooded section through Dunmere and Colquite Woods takes you to Hellanbridge. The trail finishes shortly after at Poley's Bridge. This is a nice easy walk that is also open to cyclists and horse riders.",
