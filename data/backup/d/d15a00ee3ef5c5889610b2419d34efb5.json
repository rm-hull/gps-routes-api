  "description": "Enjoy an easy coastal walk around the lovely Langstone Harbour on this easy route in Hampshire. The 2 mile circular walk runs on a flat footpath with fine views toward Hayling Island and Portsdown Hill . Habitats in the harbour include mudflats and salt water lagoons. Together with Chichester Harbour , which is at the other (eastern) side of Hayling Island, Langstone Harbour is designated as a Special Protection Area for wildlife. It's a very popular spot for birdwatchers with many wildfowl and waders to look out for on the walk. You may see redshank, dunlin, shelduck, curlew and possibly even some seals in the winter months. The village of Langstone is also nice for a stroll. It has a sailing club, interesting architecture, several historically significant buildings, including a converted (water) millhouse and a noteworthy 18th century windmill, which is a local landmark. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the Hayling Billy Trail and cross Langstone Bridge to visit Hayling Island . Here you can visit Sinah Common, Ferry Point, South Hayling, Eaststoke Beach and the Sandy Point Nature Reserve. You could also follow the Solent Way west to Farlington Marshes where you'll find a beautiful nature reserve with lots more wildlife to see.",
