  "description": "This circular walk visits Corbet Wood and the viewpoint at Grinshill, near Shrewsbury. It's a pretty area with peaceful woodland trails and great views over South Shropshire and the Welsh Borders from the dramatic cliff tops at Grinshill Hill. The site includes some rugged trails and an easier, family friendly route. Grinshill is a geologically interesting area with stone quarried in the area since at least the 12th century. It's great for wildlife too with many species of butterfly and birds including coal tits, goldcrests, warblers and woodpeckers. The route also visits the little village of Clive, birthplace of the English Restoration dramatist William Wycherley, author of 'The Country Wife'. It's nice to stroll around the village with its pretty cottages and Victorian church. You can start the walk from the car park at Corbet Wood, next to Grimshill Quarry. Then follow the woodland trails west toward Clive. Just before Clive you can turn left and follow paths up to the Grinshill viewpoint which stands at a height of 192 metres (630 ft). After taking in the views descend back to the path and head to the village of Clive. Here you'll find a lovely church made from the two different coloured sandstones quarried from Grinshill. The walk then returns to the car park along a section of the Marches Way. You can extend your walking in the area by picking up the Shropshire Way. Heading north will take you to nearby Wem, while heading south leads you through the countryside to Hadnall. The Marches Way long distance trail also passes the hill. You can pick it up and head west towards Myddle.",

      "content": "The circular Wem Walk uses part of the Shropshire Way to visit the village from the town's train station. It also visits the historic Moreton Corbet Castle, just a few miles east of Grinshill. Here you'll find the ruins of a 16th century house and 12th century medieval gatehouse. To the north east is the worthy village of Hodnet where you could pay a visit to the delightful Hodnet Hall Gardens. There's 60 acres to explore with lakes, bluebell woodland, a Water Garden and a Kitchen Garden the highlights. The historic village also includes a noteworthy Norman church and a fine pub dating to the 16th century. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Walks page."
