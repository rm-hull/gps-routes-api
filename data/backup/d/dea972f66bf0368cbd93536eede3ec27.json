  "description": "Enjoy nice woodland trails along the River Blyth in this country park in Bedlington, Northumberland. The walk starts from the main car park at Bedlington Bridge. From here you can follow a nice riverside footpath heading south to Humford Mill. There's attractive woodland and stepping stones over the Blyth to enjoy. The area is a designated nature reserve so look out for a variety of woodland birds and interesting flora. You can also follow trails north east from the car park and head along the river through Bebside Wood to Furnace Bridge. The park runs into the adjacent Plessey Woods Country Park. If you continue south west through Humford Woods you will soon come to the site. There's lots more trails to try here with a nice cafe and visitor centre.",
