  "description": "Climb one of Scotland's most popular munros on this challenging walk in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The mountains sits on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond rising to a height of 974 metres (3,196 ft). The climb takes place on a good path with a steady gradient, starting from the Rowardennan car park. The first section takes you through woodland towards Coire Corrach. You continue the ascent to Sron Aonaich and Sithean before reaching the summit where there are fabulous views across Loch Lomond & the Trossachs National Park. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you pick up the West Highland Way and enjoy a walk along Loch Lomond.",

      "content": "To the north west there's another hugely popular climb at The Cobbler. The mountain gets its name from the distinctive, large rocky summit which look like a cobbler bending over his last. The Rowardennan to Inversnaid Walk will take you along the West Highland Way to Inversnaid where you could visit another local highlight at Inversnaid Falls. For more walking ideas in the area see the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs Walks page."
