  "description": "Climb one of Scotland's most popular munros on this challenging walk in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The mountains sits on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond rising to a height of 974 metres (3,196 ft). The climb takes place on a good path with a steady gradient, starting from the Rowardennan car park. The first section takes you through woodland towards Coire Corrach. You continue the ascent to Sron Aonaich and Sithean before reaching the summit where there are fabulous views across Loch Lomond & the Trossachs National Park. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you pick up the West Highland Way and enjoy a walk along Loch Lomond.",
