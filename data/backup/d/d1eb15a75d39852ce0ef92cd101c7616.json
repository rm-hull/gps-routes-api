  "description": "This walk visits Kennick Reservoir and its surrounding woodlands, in the Dartmoor National Park. You can start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the water. Trails then head east along reservoir before heading into the Clampitt Plantation. Woodland trails then take you to the northern end of the water, where there are more nice waterside trails. It's a very pretty and peaceful area with the still waters of the reservoir surrounded by attractive pine woodland. Just to the south you will find Trenchford and Tottiford Reservoir . There's more nice trails to try here with a variety of birdlife on the reservoir and beautiful rhododendrons around the water in the summer months. You could also head to the nearby Canonteign Falls where you'll find lakes, a wooded valley and a spectacular waterfall.",
