  "description": "This walk visits Kennick Reservoir and its surrounding woodlands, in the Dartmoor National Park. You can start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the water. Trails then head east along reservoir before heading into the Clampitt Plantation. Woodland trails then take you to the northern end of the water, where there are more nice waterside trails. It's a very pretty and peaceful area with the still waters of the reservoir surrounded by attractive pine woodland. Just to the south you will find Trenchford and Tottiford Reservoir. There's more nice trails to try here with a variety of birdlife on the reservoir and beautiful rhododendrons around the water in the summer months. You could also head to the nearby Canonteign Falls where you'll find lakes, a wooded valley and a spectacular waterfall.",

The historic pub dates all the way back to the 17th century and includes a charming old interior with stone walls, beamed ceilings and inglenook fireplace. Outside there's a lovely garden area with excellent views over the surrounding hills. The Bidford frequently appears in the GBG and was South Devon Pub of the Year in 2015 and 2018. They serve a great Sunday lunch and can be found in the little village of Bidford at postcode EX6 7HT for your sat navs. There's also a village shop where you can stock up on supplies."

The site includes the popular Mamhead Sensory Trail where you can enjoy some fine views over the Exe Estuary. At the northern end of the forest you will find Haldon Belvedere (Lawrence Castle). The site is used as wedding venue but is also open to the public on certain days. The fine looking castle dates from 1788 and is surrounded by some the lovely grounds and gardens. See the Doddiscombsleigh Walk for more details. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dartmoor Walks and Devon Walks pages."
