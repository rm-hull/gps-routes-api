  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the 210m (690 ft) high Burrough Hill. Here you'll find a well-preserved Iron Age hill fort and fabulous views of the Leicestershire countryside. Plantlife in the park includes wild thyme, harebell, lady's bedstraw, salad burnet and musk thistle. Also look out for skylarks, linnets, yellowhammers, willow warblers, woodpeckers, and kestrels. Burrough Hill is located a few miles south of Melton Mowbray near the villages of Burrough on the Hill and Somerby. You can extend your walking in the area by visiting the lovely Melton Country Park where there are a number of nice footpaths to follow around the pretty lakes. The Leicestershire Round walking route also runs through the park so you could continue your walk along this waymarked trail. Following it west will take you through the countryside to Thorpe Satchville and Ashby Folville. Just to the south east is the village of Somerby.",
