  "description": "This South Gwynedd village is located in the southern section of the Snowdonia National Park. Abergynolwyn sits next to the Nant Gwernol railway station on the Talyllyn Railway , a narrow gauge preserved railway with heritage steam trains. This walk from the village take you along the Nant Gwernol to visit the nearby Bryn Eglwys where there is a fine walk around the old quarry. You can start the walk in the village and then follow footpaths east through the wooded gorge of the small river. On the way you will pass pretty waterfalls before coming to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The quarry once employed over 300 men before closing in 1948. You can explore the site and see the evidence of the area's industrial past while enjoying some fine views over the surrounding mountains. To continue your walking around Abergynolwyn head north to visit the lovely Tal-y-llyn Lake where there are some fine waterside paths with views over the crystal clear lake to the surrounding mountains. The lake is also a popular starting point for the climb to Cadair Idris .",
