  "description": "This Somerset based town is in a great location for exploring the wonderful Cheddar Gorge and Cheddar Reservoir. The town itself is also a lovely place for a stroll with a medieval town square and many old black and white timber framed buildings to admire. This circular walk from the town takes you up into the Mendip Hills, climbing to Shute Shelve Hill, Axbridge Hill, Wavering Down and the wonderful viewpoint at Crook Peak. There's also some nice waterside trails along the Cheddar Yeo River and along Cheddar Reservoir on this varied walk. The walk starts in the town centre and follows footpaths north up to Axbridge Hill and Shute Shelve Hill. You continue to Callow Drove, turning west to King's Wood where you can pick up the West Mendip Way. Follow the waymarked footpath west and it will take you to the trig point on Wavering Down. The route continues west to Compton Hill, Barton Hill and Crook Peak where there are far reaching views to the coast. You descend to the south east to Compton Bishop village and Cross where you can pick up a footpath along the Cheddar Yeo River. Continue to Stubbington Grove and the turn east to visit Cheddar Reservoir where you pass along the western side of the water before returning to the town centre.",
