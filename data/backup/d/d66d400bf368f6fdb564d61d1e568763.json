  "description": "This circular walk in Devon takes you from the village of Otterton takes you to the beautiful Ladram Bay. The varied 9 mile walk includes countryside trails, coastal paths with fine sea views and an easy riverside footpath to finish. You can start the walk in Otterton and then follow a country lane south east to reach the bay. It's a photogenic spot with striking sandstone sea stacks in a lovely bay with a pretty beach. At the bay you can pick up a section of the South West Coast Path and follow it south to visit the Otter Estuary Nature Reserve. At the reserve you can look out for a wide variety of birdlife and enjoy views to nearby Budleigh Salterton on the opposite side of the river. From the reserve you then pick up a riverside footpath along the River Otter to take you back to the village.",

The 15th century house is not open to the public but it can be viewed from the nearby road (Hayes Lane). Sir Walter Raleigh's father was tenant here and a Church Warden at East Budleigh where the family crest on the bench end and his step-mother's tomb can be seen today. Postcode is EX9 7BS."
