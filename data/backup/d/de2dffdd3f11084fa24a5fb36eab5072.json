  "description": "This lovely circular walk takes you to some of the highlights of the Oxfordshire town of Witney. There's nice riverside paths along the River Windrush and a visit to Witney Lake to enjoy. The walk starts in the town centre, next to the tourist information centre where there is parking and toilet facilities. Then head east along Crown Lane to Langle Common, crossing the river on the way. The route then turns south, following a footpath along the river to Witney Lake. There's a nice path around the lake and through the surrounding meadows. You then return to the town centre passing the Leys Recreation Ground on the way. After your walk you can enjoy a stroll around the attractive town. Highlights include the pretty Church Green and the Parish Church. The Witney and District Museum is also worth a visit with many artefacts and documents representing the history of the town. To continue your walking in the area head to the nearby village of Minster Lovell . You can follow paths west along the river and visit the fascinating ruins of Minster Lovell Hall. Also nearby is the medieval  town of Burford where you can try the Burford Circular Walk .",
