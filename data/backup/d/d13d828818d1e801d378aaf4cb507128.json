  "description": "Climb to the highest point in the South Downs on this challenging route in Sussex. The area is run by the National Trust and includes a series of well defined paths taking you to flower-rich meadows, ancient woodland and copses. There are fabulous views over the Weald from the Temple of the Winds, at the southern end of Black down. The English Channel can also be seen through the River Arun gap on a clear day.\u00a0The circular route below starts at the car park near the Temple of the Winds and takes you north across Black Down to Boarden Door Bottom. Cyclists can also enjoy a number of easy bridleways or more challenging mountain bike trails which run across the area. The Sussex Border Path walking trail runs through Black Down so you could pick up this trail and head west to the nearby Marley Common to continue your walk. Black Down is located just a few miles south of Haslemere town centre. You can reach it from the train station on our Haslemere Circular Walk which also visits Marley Common.",
