  "description": "Climb to the highest point in the South Downs on this challenging route in Sussex. The area is run by the National Trust and includes a series of well defined paths taking you to flower-rich meadows, ancient woodland and copses. There are fabulous views over the Weald from the Temple of the Winds, at the southern end of Black down. The English Channel can also be seen through the River Arun gap on a clear day. The circular route below starts at the car park near the Temple of the Winds and takes you north across Black Down to Boarden Door Bottom. Cyclists can also enjoy a number of easy bridleways or more challenging mountain bike trails which run across the area. The Sussex Border Path walking trail runs through Black Down so you could pick up this trail and head west to the nearby Marley Common to continue your walk. Black Down is located just a few miles south of Haslemere town centre. You can reach it from the train station on our Haslemere Circular Walk which also visits Marley Common.",

The country pub has a fine interior with beams and an inglenook fire. Outside there's a nice garden area with a stretch tent and views of the cricket on the Green in the summer. You can find them on the Green at postcode GU28 9ET for your sat navs. The village is also well worth exploring with a pretty village green, a millpond and a number of historic timber framed properties to admire. There's also the noteworthy St Laurence church which still has evidence of the original Saxon structure."
