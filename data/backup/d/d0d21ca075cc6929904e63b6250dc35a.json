  "description": "This pretty Local Nature Reserve in Bromley has some nice footpaths to try. There's 300 acres of ancient woodland, grassland and ponds to explore. Also of interest is the working farm and the ruins of Scadbury Manor. The playwright Christopher Marlowe is known to have stayed at Scadbury Manor just before his death in 1593. It was then owned by Marlowe's patron Sir Thomas Walsingham, a courtier to\u00a0Queen Elizabeth I. This circular walk runs\u00a0around the edge of the park for just over 2 miles but there are other footpaths to try as well. The Acorn Nature Trail is a waymarked walk taking you around the site. Look out for green ring-necked parakeets and a variety of butterflies\u00a0near the fruit trees. Interesting vegetation includes bluebells, yellow archangel and wood anemones. The London Loop runs through Scadbury Park so you can pick this up to extend your walk. Heading south will take you through Petts Wood and Jubilee Country Park. Here you'll find more woodland trails and wildlife including amphibians, birds, butterflies, insects, mammals and reptiles. If you head north east along the London Loop you will soon come to Foots Cray Meadows where you will find 250 acres of parkland and woodland. You can also pick up the Cray Riverway here. This pleasant waterside walk will take you south along the River Cray to the source at Orpington or north to Erith where it meets the River Darent and the Thames.",
