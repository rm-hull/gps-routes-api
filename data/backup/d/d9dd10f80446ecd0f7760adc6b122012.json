Claerwen is a gravity dam built of concrete onto bedrock, its strength coming from being able to match the weight of the water behind it, hence a 'gravity' dam. The stonework was incorporated into the design, at considerable expense, to help the dam blend into the landscape and harmonise with the Elan Valley reservoirs."

The exhaust water exits at this point."

  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk along this large reservoir in the Cambrian Mountains. There is a good track running along the northern shore of the lake which makes for a nice traffic free cycle or walk. It runs for about 6 miles starting at the Claerwen Dam car park. There are lovely views across the water to the surrounding hills and countryside. If you would like to extend your exercise in the area then you could visit the other reservoirs in the Elan Valley by heading south along the River Claerwen to Caban Coch Reservoir where you can pick up the cycling and walking trails. You could also try the Teifi Pools Walk which starts from the nearby Strata Florida Abbey near Pontrhydfendigaid.",
