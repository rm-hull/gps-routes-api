The stonework was incorporated into the design, at considerable expense, to help the dam blend into the landscape and harmonise with the Elan Valley reservoirs."

The exhaust water exits at this point."

  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk along this large reservoir in the Cambrian Mountains. There is a good track running along the northern shore of the lake which makes for a nice traffic free cycle or walk. It runs for about 6 miles starting at the Claerwen Dam car park. There are lovely views across the water to the surrounding hills and countryside. If you would like to extend your exercise in the area then you could visit the other reservoirs in the Elan Valley by heading south along the River Claerwen to Caban Coch Reservoir where you can pick up the cycling and walking trails. You could also try the Teifi Pools Walk which starts from the nearby Strata Florida Abbey near Pontrhydfendigaid.",

It's a dog friendly pub with a good menu and garden to sit outside in. After your meal you could explore the little village and enjoy a stroll along the River Teifi which runs through the centre of Pontrhydfendigaid. You can find the pub close to the river on Bridge Street with a postcode of SY256BH for your sat navs. Just to the east you will find the Elan Valley Visitor Centre next to Caban Coch Reservoir. Here you will find a nice cafe with a spacious seating area and windows all around to enjoy the wonderful view of the River Elan and Caban Coch Dam. There is also a patio area with picnic tables for people wishing to sit outside in fine weather. You can find it at postcode LD65HP."
