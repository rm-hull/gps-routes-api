  "description": "This is a popular walk taking you from Skipton to Gargrave along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The route follows a flat towpath for about 5 miles to Gargrave. Along the way you'll pass aqueducts, barges, bridges and locks. With train stations at both ends of the walk you can get easily get the train back if you wish. The walk starts in Skipton, very close to the train station and heads west past Airville Park. You continue past Thorlby Bridge and Highgate Bridge before coming into Gargrave. Head south from the canal and you will cross the River Aire before coming to the train station. You can turn it into a longer circular walk by heading north east to Flasby where you can pick up the Dales High Way. The long distance trail can then be followed past Flasby Fell to Skipton. At the end of the route you can extend your walk by trying our Gargrave Circular Walk. This explores the countryside surrounding the attractive village using the canal and the Pennine Way long distance trail. Here you can also try the Barnoldswick Canal Walk which will take you to the Lancashire village. At the other end of the route you can explore Skipton Castle which includes some nice woodland trails and a hill climb. The Skipton Circular Walk also runs along the canal but then heads north just before Gargrave to climb Flasby Fell and Sharp Haw Fell. From the elevated position there are wonderful views back down to the canal.",
