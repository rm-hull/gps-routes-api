  "description": "This long distance circular walk takes you around the coastline of the Isle of Arran off the west coast of Scotland. The fully waymarked walk starts and ends from near Brodick ferry terminal. It is classified as one of Scotland's Great Trails and runs for a distance of about 66 miles (107km). There's wonderful coastal scenery including cliff top views, beaches and rugged sections with interesting rock formations. On the route you will enjoy fine views of Goatfell the highest point on the island. There's also the lovely Glenashdale Falls and the historic Brodick Castle where there's some beautiful landscaped gardens to see. For cyclists there's the Five Ferries and the Isle of Arran Explorer cycle routes to try. Much of these routes are also suitable for walkers.",
