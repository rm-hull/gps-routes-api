  "description": "Set in the beautiful Afan Valley in Neath Port Talbot, this 48-square-mile forest park has miles of cycling trails, walking trails and several fantastic mountain bike trails. For a nice easy cycle the Rheilffordd Trail is a great option. It takes you along the River Afan on a disused railway path. For mountain bikers there are several well laid out trails. The Penhydd Trail is a 22km loop voted as the trail to ride before you die by What Mountain Bike Magazine in 2004. The 46km Skyline Trail has stunning skyline views of the Brecon Beacons, the Preselis, the Black Mountains and the South Wales coast. Walkers will find 14 waymarked circular trails taking you along the River Afan, through the peaceful woodland and up to the Ridgetops where there are fabulous views to enjoy. If you have time you could continue your outing by heading a couple of miles north east to the nearby Glyncorrwg Ponds where you will find lovely waterside walking and cycling trails.",

      "content": "The St Illtyd's Walk and the Coed Morgannwg Way both run through the park. These waymarked long distance trails provide an opportunity for exploring the surrounding area on foot. One nice idea is to follow the trails south and visit the lovely Margam Country Park. The park is great for walkers with features including the historic Margam Castle, an 18th Century Orangery with ornamental gardens and a Deer Park, all set within 1000 acres of beautiful countryside. For cyclists there are lots of trails too with a section of the National Cycle Network known as the Celtic Trail Route 4 running through the park. Just north of the parh there's the unusual Brombil Reservoir. The picturesque turquiose coloured lake is a lovely place for a peaceful stroll. From the hills surrounding the lake there are fine views to the coast too. Head north from the park and you can find more walking trails in the wonderful Brecon Beacons and the Black Mountains."
