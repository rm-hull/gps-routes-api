  "description": "Set in the beautiful Afan Valley in Neath Port Talbot , this 48-square-mile forest park has miles of cycling trails, walking trails and several fantastic mountain bike trails. For a nice easy cycle the Rheilffordd Trail is a great option. It takes you along the River Afan on a disused railway path. For mountain bikers there are several well laid out trails. The Penhydd Trail is a 22km loop voted as the trail to ride before you die by What Mountain Bike Magazine in 2004.  The 46km Skyline Trail has stunning skyline views of the Brecon Beacons, the Preselis, the Black Mountains and the South Wales coast. Walkers will find 14 waymarked circular trails taking you along the River Afan, through the peaceful woodland and up to the Ridgetops where there are fabulous views to enjoy. If you have time you could continue your outing by heading a couple of miles north east to the nearby Glyncorrwg Ponds where you will find lovely waterside walking and cycling trails.",
