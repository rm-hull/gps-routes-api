  "description": "This Worcestershire based village has some nice canalside and riverside trails to try. It's located in a fine spot in the valley of the River Arrow and has easy access to two local reservoirs and the popular Lickey Hills. There's also some interesting history with a 13th century church and several medieval half-timbered buildings to see in the village. This walk from the village takes you along the Worcester and Birmingham Canal to Barnt Green Reservoir and the Bittell Reservoirs before picking up the North Worcestershire Path and heading to Lickey Hills Country Park. It's a nice varied walk with waterside sections, hill climbs and woodland trails to enjoy. The walk starts at the canal marina in the village, just to the west of the train station. You then head north along the towpath to the Bittell Reservoirs, with views of the River Arrow on the way. At the upper reservoir you pick up the North Worcestershire Path and follow it west to visit the Lickey Hills where there's a visitor centre, cafe, woodland trails and fine views over Birmingham from the high points.",
