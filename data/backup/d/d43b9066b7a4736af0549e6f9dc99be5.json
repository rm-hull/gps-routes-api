  "description": "Aylsham is an attractive market town located in North Norfolk. There are a number of waymarked walking trails to follow through the surrounding area, including two popular rail trails. There's also some nice footpaths along the River Bure and through the nearby Blickling Estate. This circular walk from the town visits Blickling Hall and the Marriot's Way with some lovely countryside scenery to enjoy. The walk starts in the town and follows country lanes north west to pick up the Weavers' Way. You can follow the trail north up to Blickling Hall and the lake. The historic Jacobean Hall is surrounded by woodland, farmland, parkland and gardens. It includes three colour coded, way-marked walks and a lovely family cycle route around the 1 mile long lake. The route then backtracks before heading south west to link up with the Marriot's Way. This trail runs all the way to Norwich along dismantled railway lines with views of the River Wensum Valley. You can follow this trail east back into the town, passing the heritage Bure Valley Railway. There's also some 18th century houses, the old market place and a number of historical buildings to see as you make your way through the town.",
