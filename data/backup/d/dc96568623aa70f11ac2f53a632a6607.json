  "description": "This attractive Derbyshire village is located just to the south of Chesterfield. This walk in the village visits two pretty bodies of water in the area. You start off at the Wingerworth Lido where there's a short circular footpath around the water. The route then heads north west following Birkin Lane and Pearce Lane to The Great Pond of Stubbing. There's footpaths running around the large pond with woodland trails and lots of wildlife to see. On the way you'll also pass the village's Garden centre which is worth popping into. After exploring the pond the route then heads east back to the Lido. Just to the south of the village there's some walking trails around Bole Hill and the Press Reservoirs.",

You can also pick up the Five Pits Trail here and follow it east to the Williamsthorpe Ponds Nature Reserve.  Head north into Chesterfield and you can enjoy more waterside walking along the Chesterfield Canal and the Cuckoo Way. To the west there's the noteworthy Pleasley Pit Country Park. Here you will find a number of walking trails taking you to ponds, reed beds, grassland and woodland. The area also includes the picturesque Pleasley Vale where there's a nature trail running along the River Meden to the old mill buildings.
