  "description": "This attractive Derbyshire village is located just to the south of Chesterfield. This walk in the village visits two pretty bodies of water in the area. You start off at the Wingerworth Lido where there's a short circular footpath around the water. The route then heads north west following Birkin Lane and Pearce Lane to The Great Pond of Stubbing. There's footpaths running around the large pond with woodland trails and lots of wildlife to see. On the way you'll also pass the village's Garden centre which is worth popping into. After exploring the pond the route then heads east back to the Lido. Just to the south of the village there's some walking trails around Bole Hill and the Press Reservoirs.",
