  "description": "This walk visits the National Trust's lovely Hare Hill Gardens before heading to the nearby Alderley Edge for fine views over the Cheshire Plain. The walk starts from the Hare Hill car park which is located between Macclesfield and Alderley Edge. The National Trust owned site has some lovely gardens with flower beds, woodland and a pretty pond with a wooden footbridge. In the park you can see 70 varieties of rhododendron, azaleas, hollies, and hostas. The centrepiece is a walled garden containing a pergola and wire sculptures. After exploring the gardens you can then follow a permissive footpath north to Alderley Edge where there are some nice woodland trails, interesting old mines and nice viewpoints from the elevated position of the edge. It's about a 1.5 mile walk from the gardens to the edge where you can try the Miners Ramble and the Wizard Trail to further explore the area.",
