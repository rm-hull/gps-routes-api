The tower is typical of the 14th century, as dated by Pevsner, but it may have older parts possibly dating back to the 12th century. To the east of the church stands a four-metre structure of flint and rubble, almost certainly part of a circular tower and perhaps an earlier church. The area was once home to the Priory of the Holy Cross, a monastic priory dedicated to Thomas Becket, founded in 1274 and dissolved in 1538. There is some uncertainty about whether it was located in Little Whelnetham or Great Whelnetham. A Tudor house in Little Whelnetham, known as The Crutched Friars, is believed to have been part of the priory and is now a private residence."

The parish includes the hamlet of Cocks Green and the village of Sicklesmere, with which it is contiguous.  In 2019, an excavation of a 4th-century Roman cemetery in Great Whelnetham revealed unusual burial practices. Among the 52 skeletons found, up to 40% had been decapitated, providing new insights into Roman traditions. The burial ground contained remains of men, women, and children, likely from a nearby settlement. These decapitated skeletons represent a rare archaeological find."

  "description": "An easy waymarked walk along the old railway line in the village of Little Whelnetham in West Suffolk. From the pleasant, grassy path there are some nice views of the surrounding countryside. The route runs along the old Long Melford\u2013Bury St Edmunds branch line. The railway ran between Long Melford on the Stour Valley Railway and Bury St Edmunds on the Ipswich to Ely Line. The line opened on 9 August 1865 and closed to passengers on 10 April 1961 and freight on 19 April 1965. To extend your walking head north west to visit the lovely Nowton Park .",
