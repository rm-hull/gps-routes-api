It is composed of a polygonal shell keep, enclosed with a curtain wall, with corner and gate towers. The 12th-century shell keep is the earliest part of the structure, with this form of keep being common in England, but rare in Ireland. There is a two-storey military barracks within the walls dating from the early 18th-century. These barracks are restored and holds the exhibition space displaying the history of the castle. The castle has been described as Anglo-Norman, and was founded in 1185 by Prince John, on the mouth of the Colligan River. It was amongst a number of castles built around this time in the south east of Ireland."

The bay's mouth is approximately two miles wide, with Dungarvan situated about four miles inland. A meandering navigation channel, marked by red and green buoys, guides vessels from the ocean into Dungarvan. This channel is not navigable for most vessels (except small dinghies) at low tide. Even at high tide, cruising yachts and larger vessels must stay within the buoyed channel to avoid grounding. Dungarvan town features a well-maintained concrete slipway suitable for launching vessels up to eight metres in length. However, larger vessels should only use the slipway up to three hours either side of high tide. Visiting yachts can often find moorings made available by the Dungarvan Harbour Sailing Club, frequently free of charge."
