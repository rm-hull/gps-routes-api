  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the Cleadon Hills viewpoint above South Shields in Tyne and Wear. The walk starts from the car park at the Souter Lighthouse and Whitburn Coastal Park. From here you can pick up the Great North Forest Heritage Trail and follow the waymarked trail west up to the hills. Here you can see the old water tower and the photogenic ruined windmill which dates from the 1820s. There's also wonderful views across the surrounding coast and countryside from this elevated spot. The route then picks up the Bede's Way and follows it south east towards the coast at Whitburn. You can then follow the coast path north to return to the car park. The hills are also located close to Sunderland where you can enjoy a walk along Roker Beach.",

      "content": "From the hills there's fine views towards the Penshaw Monument. The iconic local landmark is another place where you can enjoy views over Sunderland and the coast. To continue your walking around South Shields catch the ferry over the water and try the Whitley Bay to Tynemouth Walk. Just north of Whitley Bay you can also visit Seaton Sluice. Here you can visit the wildlife rich St Mary's Head Nature Reserve where there's a lighthouse and fine views back to Whitley Bay. There's also the National Trust's Seaton Delaval Hall, a historic Georgian property with some lovely grounds and gardens. For more walking ideas in the area see the Tyne and Wear Walks page."
