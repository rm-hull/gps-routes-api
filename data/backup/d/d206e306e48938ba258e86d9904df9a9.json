  "description": "Explore 335 acres of mixed woodland, grassland, wildflower meadows and farmland on this country park walk or cycle near Loughborough. At 248m (814 feet), Beacon Hill is the second highest point in Leicestershire and the site of a Bronze Age hill fort. As such there are fabulous views of the Leicestershire countryside. There's a handy toposcope at the hill summit where you can see all the landmarks visible from the viewpoint. The park also has a wooden boardwalk sculpture trail, a maze and a 4.8km cycle track circling the park so you can bring your bike too. Beacon Hill is located a few miles south of Loughborough town centre and very close to the Leicestershire Round walking route.  You could pick up the trail and head to Bradgate Country Park if you wished to extend your walk.",
