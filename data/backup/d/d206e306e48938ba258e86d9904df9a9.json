  "description": "Explore 335 acres of mixed woodland, grassland, wildflower meadows and farmland on this country park walk or cycle near Loughborough. At 248m (814 feet), Beacon Hill is the second highest point in Leicestershire and the site of a Bronze Age hill fort. As such there are fabulous views of the Leicestershire countryside. There's a handy toposcope at the hill summit where you can see all the landmarks visible from the viewpoint. The park also has a wooden boardwalk sculpture trail, a maze and a 4.8km cycle track circling the park so you can bring your bike too. Beacon Hill is located a few miles south of Loughborough town centre and very close to the Leicestershire Round walking route. You could pick up the trail and head to Bradgate Country Park if you wished to extend your walk.",

There's some more nice trails here with dry stone walls, hedgerows, fences and woodlands to explore. A few miles to the east there's the pretty village of Barrow upon Soar. There's some nice walks along the Grand Union Canal and a fine waterside pub to visit here. Just to the south of Bradgate Park you'll find the secluded Groby Pool. The small lake is a good place for wildlife watching and also includes some adjacent bluebell woods. The woodland trust's Martinshaw Wood is located about half a mile south west from here too. It's another peaceful local place for bird watching and easy trails. The National Forest Way passes the park. The long distance trail takes you to several of the highlights of the National Forest area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks page."
