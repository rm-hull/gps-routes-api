  "description": "This is a delightful waterside walk around Thruscross Reservoir in the Yorkshire Dales. It's a beautiful area with the tranquil waters of the reservoir surrounded by peaceful woodland and beautiful countryside. The circular route runs for a distance of about 5 miles with small hill climbs long the way. As such it should take just under 2 hours to walk all the way around. The walk begins at the car park at the southern end of the reservoir and takes you along a good footpath to Whit Moor, Far Comb Hill and past the hugely impressive dam. It is a fairly easy walk with woodland sections, waterside sections and some moderate climbs. Highlights include the impressive Washburn Dam near the start. This historical landmark makes for a great photo. Thruscross is located near to Leeds and Harrogate. You can easily extend your walk by heading to the adjacent Fewston Reservoir. A riverside footpath along the River Washburn will take you there. Swinsty Reservoir is also just a little further south and offers a shorter walk.",
