  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Folly Dolly Falls in Meltham in Yorkshire. You can reach the falls by picking up the Meltham Greenway on the eastern side of the town, parking at the Morrisons supermarket nearby. Follow the woodland trail east for just over half a mile and you will come to the waterfall on your left, through a gap in the fence. You can then follow some steps down to the falls. The falls are a bit of a local hidden gem and thought to take their name from a lady who lived in a nearby ruined cottage. The cascade is particularly impressive after heavy rainfall.",
