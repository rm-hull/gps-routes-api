On the night that he left, the\u00a0Esk\u00a0was swollen with rainfall and he was unable to make a last visit to his intended. He eventually returned from his travels a rich man and, after marrying the squire's daughter, built Beggar's Bridge so that no other lovers would be separated as they were."

  "description": "This attractive village is located in a lovely spot in the North York Moors. The historic village includes a number of old miners houses with slate roofs. There's also a noteworthy packhorse bridge dating back to the early 17th century. This circular walk from the village visits the train station, East Arncliffe Wood and the Glaisdale Beck. The walk starts in the village and follows country lanes east to the train station on the Esk Valley Railway . You can pick up the Esk Valley Walk here and follow it along the Glaisdale Beck and the River Esk through East Arncliffe Wood towards Delves, where there are some picturesque old cottages to see. The route then follows other tracks west and then north to return to the train station. To continue your walking from the village head west to climb up to Glaisdale Moor on the Glaisdale Rigg bridleway. There's some splendid views over the North York Moors from here.",
