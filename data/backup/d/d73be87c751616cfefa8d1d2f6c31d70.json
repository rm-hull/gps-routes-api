  "description": "Visit England's smallest church on this lovely circular walk in the Exmoor National Park. The route includes coastal views, woodland sections and nice countryside views. The walk starts from the car park in Porlock Weir and heads west along the pretty quay to Worthy Wood. Here you pick up the Worthy Toll Road and follow it up to Yearner Mill Bridge where you turn north west towards the 17th century Parsonage Farm. You descend into the woodland of Withy Combe before coming to Culbone Church. The Grade I\u00a0listed building is thought to be pre-Norman in origin, with a 13th-century\u00a0porch, and late-15th-century nave.\u00a0It seats around 30 people and services are still held there. The walk proceeds through Culbone Combe with pretty streams and attractive\u00a0walnut and oak woodland. The final section runs through Yearnor Wood, passing the picturesque Worthy Toll Gate before returning to the car park. You can extend your exercise on our Porlock and Porlock Weir Walk which explores the village with its lovely harbour and delightful 17th century cottages. If you follow the South West Coast Path west you can explore the beautiful Doone Valley. Here you can try our lovely Lorna Doone Walk which visits some of the sites connected to Richard Dodderidge Blackmore's 1869 novel 'Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor'. In a television version of\u00a0Lorna Doone, St Beuno's was used as the location for the marriage of John Ridd at\u00a0Oare Church.",
