  "description": "A walk across the South Downs from Brighton to Lewes using a mixture of roads and footpaths. There's splendid views across the Downs and a visit to the Castle Hill Nature Reserve to enjoy. Starting from Brighton train station head north east towards the racecourse. After passing along the northern side of the course you come to the Drove Road, a track which you can follow up onto the South Downs. You'll pass Newmarket Hill and the Castle Hill National Nature Reserve where you will find chalk grassland, wildflowers and wonderful views to the coast. Look out for flora and fauna including carpets of yellow Birds-foot-trefoil, pink Thrift to bloom, various butterflies and the Lesser Whitethroat bird. The route then heads past Kingston near Lewes village. The pretty village includes a pond, a number of picturesque cottages and a local pub The Juggs, which is housed in a 14th-century cottage. Continue along Jugg's Road and you will soon come into Lewes, passing the 15th-century timber-framed Anne of Cleves House, before finishing near the castle. Lewes Castle stands at the highest point of the town and can be visited by purchasing tickets from Barbican House opposite the entrance gate. In Lewes you can extend your walk by visiting the delightful Mount Caburn Nature Reserve. The South Downs Way National Trail crosses the area, so you could pick up the trail to extend your walk.",

      "content": "Just a couple of miles to the south of Lewes you'll find the interesting village of Iford. The historic settlement includes 18 listed buildings, a 12th century church and a sundial marking the Greenwich meridian which runs through the village. From here you can enjoy a walk up to the viewpoint at Iford Hill on a particularly lovely section of the South Downs. On the Iford walk there's also Rodmell where you can visit the National Trust's Monk's House. The 16th-century weatherboarded cottage was once the home of author Virginia Woolfe and her husband."
