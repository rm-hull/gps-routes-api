In the foreground are plastic rafts and concrete sets tied together with steel cables, used to replace sections of the road to Spurn Point whenever it gets washed away by the sea. This bird observatory is used for monitoring migrating birds and providing accommodation to visiting birdwatchers. The migration of the birds is assisted by east winds in autumn sometimes leading to a spectacular \"fall\" of thousands of birds. You can often see wheatears, whinchats, common redstarts and flycatchers in the area. Rarer bird sightings include a cliff swallow from North America, a lanceolated warbler from Siberia and a black-browed albatross from the Southern Ocean."

  "description": "This walk explores the splendid Spurn Point National Nature Reserve on the tip of the coast of the East Riding of Yorkshire. The narrow sand spit stretches for over 3 miles into the the Humber estuary. It's a special place, perfect for a coastal walk or cycle with dramatic scenery and huge variety of wildlife. There's much to enjoy with pretty beaches, sand-dunes, marshland and the striking effects of the changing tides. You can park at the car park at Kilnsea to start your walk/ride. Then head south passing the Spurn Bird Observatory and Kilnsea Warren, with fine views across Kilnsea Clays. You continue along the peninsula to Spurn Head at the tip of the reserve. Here you will find the RNLI lifeboat station and two disused lighthouses. As you make your way through the reserve look out for a large variety of birdlife. This includes rare birds such as the cliff swallow from North America, a lanceolated warbler from Siberia and a black-browed albatross from the Southern Ocean.  More common birds include wheatears, whinchats, common redstarts and flycatchers. Several thousand birds can be seen in and around the reserve on a good day. You may also spot common seals and grey seals feeding and interacting in the month of September. It's a wonderful sight as the seals come right up to the coast so you can spot them without the need for binoculars. NB please check tide times before visiting the reserve as it is dangerous to walk to the end of the spit at high tide. To continue your exercise in the Hull area you could visit Humber Bridge Country Park and enjoy great views over the River Humber to Barton Upon Humber. The Trans Pennine Trail also runs through Hull so you could pick up the trail and enjoy a waterside walk along the Humber to Hessle. If you head up the coast to Hornsea you can enjoy a walk along the pretty Hornsea Mere which is another great place for birdwatching.",
