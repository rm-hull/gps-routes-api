  "description": "This long walk makes use of the Cumbria Coastal Way and the Hadrian's Wall Path to explore the Solway Coast AONB. The route runs from Silloth to Bowness-on-Solway taking you through some beautiful scenery using a series of waymarked paths. In Silloth you can visit the Solway Coast Discovery Centre to learn all about the area before you begin your exercise. The walk starts in Silloth next to the docks and heads north along the coast path to Skinburness and Grune Point. It's a lovely stretch of coast with the long spit of land sticking out into the beautiful Moricambe estuary. The extensive saltmarsh and mudflats attract a huge variety of wading birds so bring your binoculars! After rounding Grune Point the path heads east across Skinburness Marsh and Calvo Marsh to Abbery Town. Here you turn north towards Newton Arlosh and Kirkbride, where you cross the River Wampool on Whitrigg Bridge. The route then passes through the pretty Drumburgh Moss Nature Reserve, a site of international importance, dominated by an expanse of lowland raised mire. Look out for Curlew and red deer on this section of the walk. The final section of the walk is particularly lovely, taking you along the coast from Glasson to Port Carlise and Bowness-on-Solway. There's wonderful views across the Channel of the River Eden towards Annan in Scotland. To continue your walking in the AONB you can follow the Cumbria Coastal way east from Drumburgh. It will take you to Burgh By Sands before finishing near Gretna, on the Scottish Border. You could also follow it all the way into Carlise along the River Eden.",
