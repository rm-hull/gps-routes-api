  "description": "Enjoy miles of walking and cycling trails in this 2,400 acre forest on the Cheshire Plain, near Frodsham. For walkers there's several easy waymarked trails to try. Cyclists can enjoy challenging mountain bike trails or easy family trails. The trails are well marked and cycle hire is available from TRACS (UK) situated just the left-handside of the forest centre car park. You can see details of all the trails on the open street map link below. This circular walk starts from the Linmere car park and takes you around Blakemere Moss Lake. Look out for wildlife including greater spotted woodpecker, black headed gulls, dragonfly and various butterflies. Several long distance trails pass the forest so it's easy to extend your exercise. You can explore the Mid Cheshire Ridge on the Sandstone Trail or head towards Warrington on the Delamere Way. The Baker Way also starts at the forest and will take you to Chester via Tarvin and the Shropshire Union Canal. Just to the south of the forest you can climb to Eddisbury Hill where you will find an Iron Age hill fort. Eddisbury is the largest and most complex of the seven hill forts in the county of Cheshire. It's a short climb from the car park and affords great views over the forest and the surrounding countryside. Near here there's also Old Pale Hill which marks the high point of the northern mass of the Mid Cheshire Ridge. There's views over seven counties from this popular spot.",
