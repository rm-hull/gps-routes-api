  "description": "This peaceful circular walk takes you around the pretty North Third Reservoir near Stirling . There's a nice trail to follow around the peaceful lake with a climb to Lewis Hill on the eastern side. From here there are excellent views over the reservoir to the surrounding hills. The reservoir is very beautiful with some rugged scenery and woodland trails in the adjacent Middlethird Wood.",
