There's a nice trail to follow around the peaceful lake with a climb to Lewis Hill on the eastern side. From here there are excellent views over the reservoir to the surrounding hills. The reservoir is very beautiful with some rugged scenery and woodland trails in the adjacent Middlethird Wood.",

To continue your walking around Stirling head up to the Wallace Monument or Dumyat for more great views. There's also nice trails around Plean Country Park, Torwood Castle and Tappoch Broch and Carron Valley Reservoir. Just to the north west of the water there's the Loup of Fintry where you'll find beautiful 94ft high waterfalls. The Stirling Walk explores the wonderful medieval castle with its fascinating history, beautiful gardens and excellent views. Head south west and you could visit Banton Loch on the lovely Colzium Estate near Kilsyth. The estate includes some peaceful waterside trails and the historic Colzium House. In the grounds there's a ruined 16th century castle and some beautiful gardens to admire."
