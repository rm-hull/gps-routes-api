  "description": "This circular walk takes you from the popular Hampshire Bowman pub to Droxford using a mixture of public country footpaths in the area. The area is very attractive with views of the South Downs National Park on the way. This route runs for about 5 miles with small hill climbs on the way. The route starts from the car park of the Hampshire Bowman Pub on Dundridge Lane in the village of Dundridge. It's located just over a mile east of the medieval town of Bishop's Waltham. From here you can follow footpaths up to Shepherds Down and Peak Down before picking up the Wayfarer's Walk to take you into Droxford. The pretty village includes quaint cottages, a mill pond and some nice footpaths along the River Meon which flows just to the east. After exploring the village you then pick up country lanes to take you west to Upper Swanmore. The route then turns north to take you back to the pub where you can enjoy some well earned refreshments. The 19th century historic pub has a nice garden outdoors and a real fire indoors for colder days. The pub is dog friendly too if you have your canine friend with you.",
