  "description": "Explore the beautiful area around the town of Llangollen, in Denbighshire, on this circular walk, devised to raise funds for the Cancer Research UK charity. This is a challenging walk visiting every summit around the Vale of Llangollen with views of Snowdonia, the mid-Wales mountains, the River Dee Valley and the Shropshire Hills. Highlights on the walk include the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct (video below) - the longest and highest aqueduct in Britain. You will also pass several old slate quarries and visit Moel y Gaer (Welsh for 'bald hill of the fortress') an Iron Age hill fort on the summit of Llantysilio Mountain. To extend your walking in the area you could enjoy a waterside stroll along the Llangollen Canal and visit the beautiful Horseshoe Falls. The route passes close to the wonderful Castell Dinas Bran. There are fabulous views over the Dee Valley from the elevated position of the medieval castle ruins.",
