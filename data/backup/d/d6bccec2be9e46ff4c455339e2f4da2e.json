  "description": "A splendid coastal walk from Filey to Bridlington on the East Yorkshire coast. There's wonderful cliff top views, miles of beaches, interesting rock formations and beautiful bays. The route also passes the wonderful Bempton Cliffs and Flamborough Head, two of the best places in the country for coastal wildlife. Starting on the sea front head south along Filey Bay and the Filey beaches towards Primrose Valley. You'll pass the lovely Hunmanby Sands before coming to the villages of Reighton and Speeton. The next stage through Bempton Cliffs is a real highlight of the walk. The RSPB Nature Reserve is considered the best place in England to watch seabirds. Look out for Puffins, Gannets, Kittiwakes, Guillemots and Razorbills as you make your way along the spectacular cliffs. After leaving Bempton Cliffs the trail continues south east towards Flamborough Head. Here you will find towering white chalk cliffs, coves, caves, pretty bays and the oldest surviving lighthouse in Britain. The route then turns west heading towards the village of Sewerby where you will find the Grade I listed Georgian country house of Sewerby Hall. You can visit the hall and enjoy the splendid 50 acre landscaped gardens if you have time. The final section takes you from Sewerby to Bridlington, passing along the beach before finishing at the pier. After exploring the popular seaside town you can get the train directly back to Filey. Here you can pay a visit to the splendid Filey Brigg Country Park where you'll find some fascinating geology, an on site cafe and more fine views.",
