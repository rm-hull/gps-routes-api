  "description": "Rollesby Broad is located just to the east of the Norfolk village of Rollesby. There's a parking area on the A road in between the broad and the adjacent Ormesby Broad. You can enjoy a short walk along a footpath with information boards, benches and a fine view across the water. If you cross the road there's a pavement running along Ormesby Broad, so you can turn it into a pleasant little circular stroll. Just to the south there's Fleggburgh and Filby Broad where you can enjoy a longer circular walk around the neighbouring village.",
