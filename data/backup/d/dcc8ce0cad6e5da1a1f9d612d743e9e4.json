  "description": "This is a popular walk from Southwold to Walberswick, passing along the coast and the River Blyth. It's an easy stroll, running for about 3 miles on a flat section of the Suffolk Coast Path , passing some of the marshland surrounding the two settlements. Start the walk on the sea front in Southwold and then head south along Havenbeach Marshes to the river. Here you turn right to follow a path along Southwold Harbour to Woodsend Marshes. A footbridge then takes you to the other side of the river where you turn south to follow the path to the coast at Walberswick. The route passes along the beach before turning into the village centre where you can enjoy refreshments at one of the cafes. As an alternative route you could continue along the Blyth to Reydon Marshes and Tinker's Marshes before crossing Walberswick Common to reach the village. You can extend your walking by heading to the Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve which is located just to the west of the village. It's a great place for walks and wildlife watching with a wide variety of habitats including heathland, reed beds, grassland, woodlands, shingle, lagoons, mudflats and the salt marshes of the Blyth estuary.",
