  "description": "This riverside village is located just a few miles south of Darlington in County Durham. The village is a good place to start a walk with a number of footpaths and a noteworthy pub dating back to the 1400s. This circular walk from the village explores the surrounding countryside, visiting the neighbouring villages of Dalton-on-Tess and Croft-on-Tees. The route uses a section of the Teesdale Way which runs through the area. The route starts in the village and heads east along the river to Low Hail Bridge. Cross the river here and then head south along a bridle track to Eryholme Lane, passing Low Hail Farm on the way. Follow footpaths west and they will take you through Dalton Wood to Dalton-on-Tees. The next stage takes you north to Croft-on-Tees on the pavement next to the Northallerton Road. Cross the river here and head east through the farmland to return to Hurworth on Tees.",
