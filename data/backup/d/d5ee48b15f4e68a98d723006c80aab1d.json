  "description": "Enjoy a nice easy stroll around the pretty Arlington Reservoir on this short circular walk near Hailsham. There's parking on the western side of the reservoir and a good path running around the perimeter. The walk includes a woodland  section at the start before reaching the dam where there are fabulous views across the Downs and the Long Man of Wilmington, The area is also a nature reserve and excellent for bird watching with 173 recorded bird species and a wintering population of up to 10,000 wildfowl. Look out for great crested grebe, swallow, mallard, pied wagtail and cormorants.These can best be observed from the bird hide. The reservoir can also be easily accessed by train - get off at Berwick station and a short walk north takes you to the start of the walk. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up either the Vanguard Way or the Wealdway which both run past Arlington. About a mile to the east you will find the pretty Abbot's Wood. There's two nice waymarked walking trails to try in the bluebell woods.",
