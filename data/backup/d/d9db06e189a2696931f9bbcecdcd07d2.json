  "description": "This Burgh in Aberdeenshire is located in a fine spot on the River Dee. It's proximity to the Cairngorms National Park makes it a fine base for walkers. One way to explore the area is to try the 7 Bridges Walk . This circular walk explores the countryside around the town visiting several bridges on the River Dee and River Muick which run through the area. There's also Monaltrie Park on the eastern side of town and the climb to Craigendarroch Hill to the north. There's excellent views over the town and surrounding area from this viewpoint. See the map links below for details of the footpaths in the area. Scroll down for a list of walks near and around the town. For more information on the history, climate, local attractions, transport links and the royal connection to Balmoral Castle see the informative wikipedia page.",
