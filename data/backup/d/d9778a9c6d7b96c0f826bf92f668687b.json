  "description": "This is an atmospheric circular walk around the fascinating Holy Island in Northumberland. You will visit the dramatic 16th century castle, the beautiful walled castle garden and the nearby lime kilns. The route also passes the ruins of the ancient Lindisfarne Priory. The coastal scenery is beautiful with views of the Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve where you can see a variety of wildlife. Look out for Pinkfooted and greylag geese, wigeons, grey plovers, bar-tailed godwits and the rare pale-bellied brent geese as you make your way around the island. Grey seals and common seals can also be seen around the island's rocks. Habitats in the reserve include include intertidal mudflats, rocky shore, sand dunes, salt marshes and lovely beaches around Coves Haven. You can also see wilflowers such as purple northern marsh orchid and early marsh orchid in the summer months. You can start the walk from the car park on the eastern side of the island. Then pick up the trails to take you to the castle and around the coastal path. If you prefer you can start the walk in Beal on the western side of the causeway where there's another car park. The Holy Island Causeway Walk will then take you offer the wonderful causeway to the island. It's essential to check the tide times before attempting this as you can cut off by the incoming tide very quickly. The St Cuthbert's Way long distance trail starts/finishes on the island. You can pick up the trail and head east to cross the Lindisfarne Causeway and head to the noteworthy St Cuthberts Cave. The monks of Lindisfarne reputedly brought St. Cuthbert's body to the site in AD875 following Viking raids on the Island. They sheltered in the caves before travelling the old kingdom of Northumberland for a number of years before finally settling at Durham. The bones are now enshrined in Durham Cathedral behind the main altar. Near the cave there's also the peaceful woodland trails and steep rock climbing cliffs in the adjacent Kyloe Woods. You can virtually explore the island using the google street view link below!",
