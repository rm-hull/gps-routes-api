  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Labrador Bay nature reserve and coastal viewpoint near Shaldon in Devon. You can start the walk from the Labrador Bay car park on Teignmouth Road, just south of Shaldon. There's some great views over the bay from here and a RSPB nature reserve where you can look out for wildlife including cirl buntings. Dolphins can also sometimes be spotted in the waters below. During the warmer months there's a van selling delicious ice cream and other refreshments. Near here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it north to Bundle Bay and Ness Beach. There's nice views here over the Teign River to Teignmouth.",

There's a Wildlife Discovery Centre, Nature Reserve and a watersports centre next to a pretty lake to enjoy here. The circular Shaldon Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the bay. It also passes the splendid Shaldon Botanical Gardens which are well worth a visit. Head south towards Torquay and you'll find the peaceful Brunel Woods on the northern outskirts of the town. The site is named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel who loved the area and intended to set up home at Watcombe Park before he died. The John Musgrave Heritage Trail can be picked up in this area too. The waymarked trail runs from Maidencombe to Brixham, visiting several of South Devon's interesting historical sites on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
