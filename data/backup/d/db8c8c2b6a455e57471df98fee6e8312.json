  "description": "Climb to this gritstone escarpment in the Pennine Hills and enjoy wonderful views over Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The high point stands at 1,549 feet (472 m) with Manchester city centre, Winter Hill and the mountains of north Wales visible on a clear day. You can start your walk from the car park near Blackstone Edge Reservoir. From here you can pick up the Pennine Way and follow it to the summit. If you continue south along the path it will take you to Rock Stones Hill and Green Hole Hill. Heading north will take you to White Holme Reservoir, Warland Reservoir, Langfield Common and Withens Clough Reservoir. If you prefer you could start the walk from Hollingworth Lake in Littleborough. There are footpaths across the moors to Blackstone Edge from the town. At the lake you can also pick up the South Pennine Water Trail which is a great way of exploring this area of the South Pennines.",
