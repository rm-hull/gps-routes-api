  "description": "Enjoy fabulous views over Cheshire on this climb to Shutlingsloe Hill in the Peak District. The distinctive hill is also known as the Cheshire Matterhorn due to its shape from certain directions. The walk starts from the Trentabank Reservoir car park and follows a footpath through Macclesfield Forest to Shutlingsloe, passing Nessit Hill on the way. There is quite a steep path to the 506 m (1,660 ft) summit but you will be rewarded with splendid views of the surrounding Peak District scenery. At the summit you will find a toposcope detailing all the landmarks visible from the viewpoint. This includes Shining Tor and the famous large dish of the radio telescope at Joddrell Bank. You can return on the same path or descend to Wildboarclough and return on country lanes to make it a circular walk. Highlights on the walk include nice woodland trails through the conifer forest and views over Trentabank Reservoir with its heronry and interesting plantlife. It's easy to extend your walking in this lovely area. You could head west from the car park to Ridegate Reservoir and pick up the Gritstone Trail and follow it to the excellent Tegg's Nose Country Park .",

      "content": "To the south of the hill there's the small village of Wildboarclough where you will find The Crag Inn for some post walk rest and refreshment. The historic inn was originally a farm built in 1629 and then later converted to a beer house 1825. There's two cosy real fires indoors and a nice garden area for warmer days. They have a car park and are also dog friendly. You can find them at postcode SK11 0BD for your sat navs. You can also start the walk from here and follow a track north west to the summit. The Wildboarclough valley is very attractive with its streams, Georgian mill and beautiful countryside."
