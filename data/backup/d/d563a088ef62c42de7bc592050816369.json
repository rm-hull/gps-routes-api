  "description": "A nice circular walk around Swindon, visiting the Wilts and Berks Canal, the Old Town Railway Path, Lawns Park and Queen's Park. It's about a 5 mile walk with waterside trails, nature reserves and nice views of the surrounding countryside. You can pick up the canal towpath in the Kingshill area of Swindon, just a short distance from the tourist information centre and the train station. Follow the canal south west until you come to the Rushy Platt Nature Reserve on the River Ray. Here you can pick up the Old Town Railway Path and follow the shared cycling and walking trail east to Lawns Park. The pretty park has some nice footpaths through woodland and around a lake. See the video below for an aerial view of the park. After exploring Lawns Park you head past Queen's Park which also has a nice lake and a diverse range of ornamental trees and shrubs. Shortly after you pass the tourist information centre and return to the canal. You can extend your walking in the Swindon area by heading to Stanton Country Park or Mouldon Hill Country Park where there are some nice cycling and walking trails to try. You could also enjoy a climb to Liddington Hill for great views over the surrounding area.",

The pub is situated in a lovely spot next to the canal and includes a fine interior with canal memorabilia decorating the pub. It even includes a canal boat cleverly nestled into the design of this modern pub. They serve good quality food and have a nice garden area next to the canal. You can find them at the southern end of the canal at Peglars Way with a postcode of SN1 7DA for your sat navs. There is a parking area and they are also dog friendly."

      "content": "On the southern outskirts of the town you'll find Coate Water Country Park where there are some fine waterside trails and lots of wildlife to see. On the edge of the park you could also pay a visit to the fascinating Richard Jeffries Museum. Jeffries was a Victorian nature writer with a passion for the English countryside. He even gave us a name for it all: wild life. He was born in Swindon at Coate in the delightful 17th century thatched house which is now a museum to his life and work. The house is also surrounded by lush gardens making it a lovely place for a stroll near the town. You can find the museum at postcode SN3 6AA, just to the north east of Coate Water. Just to the north east you could pick up the Highworth Walk where you can visit the 17th century Hannington Hall and enjoy the Georgian architecture in the pleasant market town of Highworth. To the west there's neighbouring Wootton Bassett where you could visit the Jubilee Lake Nature Reserve on the northern side of the town. There's some pleasant waterside footpaths with lots of wildlife to see here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Wiltshire Walks page."
