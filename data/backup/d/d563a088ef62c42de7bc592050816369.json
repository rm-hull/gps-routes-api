  "description": "A nice circular walk around Swindon, visiting the Wilts and Berks Canal , the Old Town Railway Path, Lawns Park and Queen's Park. It's about a 5 mile walk with waterside trails, nature reserves and nice views of the surrounding countryside. You can pick up the canal towpath in the Kingshill area of Swindon, just a short distance from the tourist information centre and the train station. Follow the canal south west until you come to the Rushy Platt Nature Reserve on the River Ray. Here you can pick up the Old Town Railway Path and follow the shared cycling and walking trail east to Lawns Park. The pretty park has some nice footpaths through woodland and around a lake. See the video below for an aerial view of the park. After exploring Lawns Park you head past Queen's Park which also has a nice lake and a diverse range of ornamental trees and shrubs. Shortly after you pass the tourist information centre and return to the canal. You can extend your walking in the Swindon area by heading to Stanton Country Park or Mouldon Hill Country Park where there are some nice cycling and walking trails to try. You could also enjoy a climb to Liddington Hill for great views over the surrounding area.",
