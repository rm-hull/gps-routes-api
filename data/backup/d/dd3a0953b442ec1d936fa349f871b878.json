  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll through Dogmersfield park on this circular walk in Hampshire. The walk starts at the Basingstoke Canal car park in Odiham and follows the canal towpath past Odiham Common to the pretty Tundry Pond. You then follow footpaths around Dogmersfield Lake before picking up the canal to take you back to the car park. The park is located just to the west of Fleet and Farnborough. The Odiham Castle and Canal Walk starts from the same car park. You can follow the canal a couple of miles to the west to visit the historic ruins of the 13th century castle. There are also views of the River Whitewater at Warnborough Green to enjoy here.",
