  "description": "This pretty village in Derbyshire is known as the location for the setting for the\u00a0ITV\u00a0series\u00a0Peak Practice and the Crich Tramway Village. This circular walk from Crich visits some of the highlights of the area including the Cromford Canal , the River Derwent, the viewpoint at Crich Stand and the splendid Crich Tramway Village . The walk starts in the centre of the village and heads west past Chasecliff Farm to the Cromford Canal. You head north along the canal which runs along the River Derwent and the Derwent Valley Heritage Way . This part of the walk passes Whatstandwell where there is a train station which provides access to the route. Near Gregory Dam you leave the canal and head east through Leashaw Wood toward Wakebridge. The path then heads around Cliff Quarry before coming to Crich Stand where there is a noteworthy memorial to the Sherwood Foresters\u00a0regiment who died in battle, particularly in\u00a0World War I. You can climb to the top of the memorial tower which stands at a height of 1,000 feet (300\u00a0m). From here there are wonderful views over the surrounding countryside to the\u00a0Humber Bridge\u00a0and\u00a0Lincoln Cathedral. Just to the south of the viewpoint is the popular Tramway Village. \u00a0The museum contains over 60 trams built between 1873 and 1982 and is set within a recreated period village containing a working pub, cafe, old-style sweetshop and tram depots.\u00a0 You can take a ride on a tram which takes you into the local countryside. After leaving the museum the route heads south along a footpath into Crich.",
