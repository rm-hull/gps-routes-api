It's a very scenic area with the fine views towards the surrounding hills and countryside. The windfarm is notable as only third ever to be installed in their country. You can extend the walk by picking up the Dales Way just to the east of the reservoir. This can be followed along the River Wharfe to the nearby Bolton Abbey .",

Just to the west there's another waterside path to try along the smaller Embsay Reservoir. Barden Reservoir lies just a few miles north west. The reservoir is located just north of Addingham where you can pick up the Ilkley Riverside Walk and the Ilkley to Addingham Walk. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nidderdale Walks page."
