The old common rights custom of 'pannage', bringing livestock into the forest to graze, meant that pigs grubbed out the root stock whilst foraging; fire was the probable cause of the tree loss and as it is low lying Gleadthorpe Open is susceptible to late frosts. Queen Oak Plantation is straight ahead. This probably originates from the 19th Century when a common name for the Major Oak was The Queen Oak."

The oaks in Sherwood are both the Pedunculate or English Oak (Quercus robur) and the Sessile Oak (Quercus petraea). One of the features which differentiates the two species is the leaf stalk or petiole. On the Pedunculate oak this is very short, typically less than 0.5 cm. long, whereas on the Sessile oak the petiole is 1-2 cm. in length. As Sessile and Pedunculate oak hybridise naturally with each other, producing trees of intermediate characteristics, this can make it difficult to accurately identify the tree to the species level. This is a common factor in Sherwood and many intermediate trees can be found."

Note the bracket fungus, Fomes fomentarius commonly known as Tinder Fungus or Hoof Fungus, growing on this trunk."

A short time later the tree was renamed the Major's Oak which was quickly modified to the Major Oak. Apart from a short period in the 19th Century when it acquired the additional name of the Queen Oak, it retains this name to this day."

  "description": "Explore 450 acres of peaceful woodland in this famous park and Nature Reserve in Nottinghamshire. In Sherwood Forest you'll pass the 800 year old Major Oak which is rumoured to be the base of Robin Hood. There are also excellent facilites with a Visitor Centre and cafe. This circular trail runs for about 6 miles using the waymarked paths around the visitor centre which is located just north of Edwinstowe. There's a good sized car park located here too. There are numerous cycling and walking tracks running through the park with National Cycle Route 6 passing through the centre of the park (see the Nottingham to Worksop Cycle Route ). The Robin Hood Way Walk also passes right through the park. Our Mansfield Cycle Route passes through the park and will take you to the nearby Clumber Park where there's miles of nice trails and a beautiful lake.",
