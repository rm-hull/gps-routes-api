  "description": "This fine circular walk explores the area around the lovely Surrey village of Tilford. The attractive village includes a pretty green, cricket pitch and two medieaval stone bridges over the River Wey which runs through the settlement. Tilford is located just a few miles south of the large town of Farnham . This walk from the village visits Stockbridge Pond, Tilford Common, Frensham Ponds Country Park , Hankley Common and the River Wey. The walk starts from the public car park in the village. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south east to Stockbridge Pond which sits on the fringe of Hankley Common. The expansive common has miles of good footpaths including a section of the epic Greensand Way . The route then heads west across the woodland on Tilford Common to one of the area highlights at Frensham Ponds. The scenic ponds are a popular place for a waterside walk with a large variety of water loving wildlife to look out for. From the ponds you head north east with views of the River Wey before crossing the ancient stone bridge and returning to the village.",
