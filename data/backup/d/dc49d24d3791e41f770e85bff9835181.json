  "description": "This cycling and walking route follows cycle tracks and the Great Glen Way from Invermoriston to Drumnadrochit. The track runs through Creag Nan Eun Forest with splendid views of Loch Ness as you go. It's a 12 mile walk with some moderate climbs on the way, so a good level of fitness is required. The loch is the second largest\u00a0Scottish loch\u00a0by surface area at 56\u00a0km2\u00a0(22\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) after\u00a0Loch Lomond, but due to its great depth, it is the largest by volume in the British Isles. However it is best known for alleged sightings of the\u00a0famous Loch Ness Monster, also known affectionately as \"Nessie\". At the start of the walk you can enjoy a view of Invermoriston Falls from the 19th century Thomas Telford\u00a0bridge. The old bridge is located just south west of the village and provides fine views over the rushing falls. The Caledonia Way also runs along the loch. This epic cycle route runs for 234 miles from Campbeltown to Inverness. It's a great way of continuing your cycling or walking in the area.",
