  "description": "This easy walk visits these two idyllic Cotswolds villages. It follows the North Cotswold Diamond Way through the countrsyide from Guiting Power to the nearby Temple Guiting. There's waterside paths along the Guiting Stream and a woodland section through Castlett Wood to enjoy. Both villages are also delightful. In Guiting Power there is a pretty village green and a Norman doorway to the church. If you would like to continue you walking in the area then you could follow the Warden's Way to the Slaughters and Bourton on the Water which are both close by.",
