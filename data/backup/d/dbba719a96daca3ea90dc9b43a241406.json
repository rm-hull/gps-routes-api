In places the land between the reservoir and the adjacent hillside has also filled with water and become boggy and it all seems to have been too much for this tree!"

  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk around this pretty reservoir near Banbury . There's a car park at the northern end of the water where you can start your walk. It's less than a mile east of Upper Boddington and also very close to the village of Byfield. You could easily start the walk from there if you prefer. A footpath then leads you around the reservoir to the smaller Byfield Reservoir on the eastern side of Boddington Reservoir. Around here there is some woodland and footpaths heading east to Byfield. As you make your way round the water there are lovely views of the surrounding Northamptonshire countryside and lots of wildlife to see. Look out for ducks, green woodpeckers and dragonflies as you make your way along the 1.5 mile trail. You should also see lots of fishermen as it is a great location for carp fishing. The site is located a few miles north of Chipping Warden where you can pick up the Macmillan Way long distance trail. This links with the Oxford Canal Walk where you can further explore the Cherwell Valley and head towards Banbury.",
