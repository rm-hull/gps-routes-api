  "description": "Explore the stunning Ardnamurchan Peninsula on this breathtaking walk on the west coast of Scotland. The circular walk starts at the car park at Portuairk and takes you along the coast to beautiful white sand beaches with turquoise water. You continue on to the Ardnamurchan Point lighthouse which is commonly described as the most westerly point of the British mainland although the nearby Corrachadh Mor is a few metres further west. The route then returns to the start point on country lanes, passing Loch Grigadale on the way.",
