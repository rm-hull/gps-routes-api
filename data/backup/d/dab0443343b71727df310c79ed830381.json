  "description": "This circular walk explores Lineover Wood near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire.  The wood covers an area of over 100 acres and has some nice walking trails to try. It sits in an elevated position above the town so there are some nice views over the Cotswolds countryside to the Malvern Hills. The area consists of limestone grassland and ancient woodland with lots of different types of flora and fauna to look out for. Trees at the site include ash, pedunculate oak, whitebeam, small-leaved lime and large-leaved lime (nationally rare). The understorey is hazel, field maple, hawthorn and there are lime-loving shrubs in particular areas. At the southern end of the woods you can enjoy a climb to Ravensgate Hill and Wistley Hill for better views. The Cotswold Way National Trail runs right through the woods so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Heading north will take you to Dowdeswell Woods and Reservoir where there are more nice trails and lots of wildlife to see. Just to the west of the woods is the climb to Leckhampton Hill where there are earthworks and fine views to the Severn vale.",
