In March 2009 a new temporary route for horse riders and cyclists was opened between Old Winchester Hill and Beacon Hill. This new route replaces the old temporary route that ran though Warnford. The South Downs Way website says \"The route has been changed to improve the safety of users until agreement can be reached on a permanent route across the valley ... The old route is still usable but is not recommended and is not signed as the South Downs Way.\" The temporary route is likely to be in place until March 2011. This view is the upper part of a permissive stretch approaching the trig point on Beacon Hill, just beyond the wooden gate."

  "description": "This walk climbs to the lovely Beacon Hill Nature Reserve from Meonstoke in Hampshire. You can follow a section of The South Downs Way north west from the village to reach the viewpoint. It's about a 1.5 mile walk, steadily climbing to the 201 metre high hill summit. Here you'll also find a\u00a0round barrow cemetery\u00a0dating to the\u00a0Late Neolithic\u00a0or\u00a0Bronze Age, which is designated as a\u00a0scheduled monument. \nThere are fine views to the Itchen Vallley , the New Forest, the\u00a0Solent\u00a0and\u00a0Isle of Wight\u00a0and round to Portsdown Hill . The hill is also a great place for flora and fauna with a wide variety of butterflies to be seen fluttering around the wildflowers. Look out for brown argus,\u00a0green hairstreak,\u00a0chalkhill blue,\u00a0marbled white\u00a0and\u00a0dingy skipper as you make your way through area during the summer months. Please note the site is not to be confused with Beacon Hill near Newbury . This hill is located some way to the north in the Highclere Castle Estate.",
