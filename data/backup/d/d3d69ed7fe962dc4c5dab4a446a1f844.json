  "description": "This walk visits the Shropshire village of Hopton Castle where you can explore the ancient ruins of the mediaeval castle. It then goes on to follow a long distance waymarked footpath to the nearby Clun Castle. You can start from the car park at the 12th century castle which was besieged in a battle of the English Civil War in 1644. After exploring the castle the route picks up the Bishop's Castle Ring and heads west through the village where you will find some old timber framed thatched cottages. The route continues west along a bridle track to Sowdley Wood and Black Hill, a popular place for mountain bikers. At the other side of the woodland you will come to Clun where you can visit the English Heritage run castle. The Norman castle includes a tall 13th century keep set on the side of its mound. There's some fine views over the area from the elevated position of the castle.",
