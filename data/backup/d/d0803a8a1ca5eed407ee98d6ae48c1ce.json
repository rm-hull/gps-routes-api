Falcon climbing frame at Rosliston which is the oldest of the Forestry Commission's community woodlands within The National Forest. 120,000 trees were planted between 1994 and 1996 creating areas of broadleaf wood (oak, ash, birch) pine wood and larch wood. Existing mature woodland is found at Fox Covert which gives a clue as to how the rest of the wood may look in the future. The site already boasts many facilities including a visitor centre, Falcon restaurant, indoor play area, craft centre, waymarked walks and cycle routes, outdoor play area including crazy golf and basketball court, trim trail, sensory garden, two memorial woods, BBQ site and observation hides and the magnificent Rolls Royce Greenheart lake on which fishing is permitted."
