  "description": "This large forest in the North York Moors has miles of walking trails and a mountain bike trail. Cyclists can also follow the many country lanes that run through the woods. The woods consist mainly of pine trees with some great viewpoints to visit. The Raptor viewpoint overlooks Troutsdale and is a popular spot for birdwatchers looking for birds of prey such as Buzzards and Crossbills. From the High Wood Brow viewpoint there are great views over the River Derwent Valley. The forest is located just to the east of the expansive Dalby Forest . It's a great place to extend your outing with miles of cycling and walking trails to follow. Also nearby is the splendid Bridestones nature reserve with its fascinating sandstone sculptures and variety of interesting flora fauna. You could follow the long distance Tabular Hills Walk to both of these sites. The waymarked 48 mile trail takes you across the southern boundary of the North York Moors National Park from Scarborough to Helmsley .",
