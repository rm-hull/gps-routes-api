  "description": "This large forest in the North York Moors has miles of walking trails and a mountain bike trail. Cyclists can also follow the many country lanes that run through the woods. The woods consist mainly of pine trees with some great viewpoints to visit. The Raptor viewpoint overlooks Troutsdale and is a popular spot for birdwatchers looking for birds of prey such as Buzzards and Crossbills. From the High Wood Brow viewpoint there are great views over the River Derwent Valley. The forest is located just to the east of the expansive Dalby Forest. It's a great place to extend your outing with miles of cycling and walking trails to follow. Also nearby is the splendid Bridestones nature reserve with its fascinating sandstone sculptures and variety of interesting flora fauna. You could follow the long distance Tabular Hills Walk to both of these sites. The waymarked 48 mile trail takes you across the southern boundary of the North York Moors National Park from Scarborough to Helmsley .",

To the north is the expansive Broxa Forest where there are more fine cycling and walking trails. Head south east and you can explore Forge Valley Woods. This nature reserve has a nice boardwalk trail along the River Derwent. The woods can be reached on the circular West Ayton Walk which starts from the delightful village. Head east along the Tabular Hills Walk and it will take you to Raincliffe Woods and the Scarborough Sea Cut and Scalby Beck Walk. Here you can enjoy a waterside walk along the pretty river and explore another area of local woodland. For more walking ideas in the area see the North York Moors Walks page."
