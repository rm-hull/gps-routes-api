  "description": "This reservoir in the western lakes has some lovely woodland trails to follow through the three forestry plantations surrounding the water. It's a delightfully peaceful place with lovely views across the still waters to the surrounding fells. Start the walk from the car park at Felldyke just to the west of Cogra Moss. You can the follow a footpath to the lake before picking up the woodland trails around the water. It's a fairly flat and easy route though the walk can be extended by heading up to Lamplugh and Murton Fell. Blake Fell to the east also provides wonderful views to the coast. The lake is located only a couple of miles from Loweswater. The small lake has a lovely lakeside path to follow around the perimeter. Also nearby are Crummock Water and Buttermere where there are more nice trails around these larger lakes.",
