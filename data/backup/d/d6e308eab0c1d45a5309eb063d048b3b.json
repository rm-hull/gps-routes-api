  "description": "This country park in Belfast has miles of nice footpaths to try. In the park you'll find woodland trails and moderate hill climbs with splendid views towards the city and the Antrim Hills. The park is something of a hidden gem of the city, located just to the north east of the city centre, near Belfast Lough RSPB. In the park you will find lovely leafy glens with narrow flowing streams, fern gullies, hedges, and high deciduous woodland. From the wonderful viewpoint you can see over Belfast Lough, Belfast Harbour, George Best City Airport, Cave Hill Country Park and Belfast Castle. The park is also great for flora and fauna. Look out for wildlife including red squirrels, tits, finches, willow warblers and blackcaps. In springtime you can see carpets of bluebells, wood sorrel and anemones. The Ulster Way long distance footpath passes through the park so you can easily pick this up to extend your walk. Head south and you will soon join with the Comber Greenway. The excellent cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line between Belfast and Comber. You can pick it up in Dundonald, just a mile or so to the south of the park. Other nice walks around Belfast include Cave Hill Country Park on the opposite side of Belfast Harbour, and the splendid Lagan Valley Regional Park on the River Lagan.",
