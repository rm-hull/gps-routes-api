This is a section of the Waterton Park perimeter wall, also known as Walton Hall. Walton Hall is famous not only locally but throughout the world as the home of Charles Waterton, the famous naturalist who died in 1865. Squire Waterton transformed the lake and its surrounding parkland into the world's first wildfowl reserve and sanctuary. Many species still breed here today. Walton Hall was built by Charles Waterton's father in the eighteenth century."
