The pale line at the edge of this is to top of the (recently completed) new sea wall. To the left of this is Benfleet Creek, with Canvey Island on the other side."

Much of the drive for its establishment came from Councillor Dennis Nisbet, seen in this image at the opening ceremony. The park was officially opened at this event by Sir Derek Barber, chairman of the Countryside Commission. However, I have shown Dennis Nisbet as I consider he was the one worthy of illustration! The date was sometime in the summer of 1987."

Hadleigh Castle is not actually in the country park (which is probably why they changed the name from 'Hadleigh Castle Country Park' to 'Hadleigh Country Park'). This view shows the remains of the castle on a mound overlooking the estuary. In its heyday, the castle would have been right next to the estuary. Today, the middle distance is occupied by Hadleigh Marsh. The area of this beyond the railway line (across the centre) is now used for growing vegetables. Beyond this, near the top centre, the triangular pool is at the western tip of Two-Tree Island. Since this photo was taken, this pool has been colonised by Avocets, and these have recently bred successfully there."

  "description": "This lovely park is located on the Thames Estuary near Southend on Sea. The park is nearly 400 acres in size and includes a mix of woodland, pasture, hay meadow and marsh.  There are a number of great trails suitable for cyclists and walkers. There is also the 13th century Hadleigh castle ruins where there are fabulous views of the surrounding Essex countryside and the River Thames. The Saffron Trail passes through the park so you can pick this up to extend your walk. The long distance trail takes you from the coast at Southend-on-Sea to Saffron Walden through some lovely Essex countryside. Just to the east of the park you will find the Two Tree Island nature reserve. The expansive site has some nice footpaths taking you around grassland, scrub, reedbed and lagoons. If you head south from the park you can cross Benfleet Creek and pick up the coastal path around Canvey Island .",
