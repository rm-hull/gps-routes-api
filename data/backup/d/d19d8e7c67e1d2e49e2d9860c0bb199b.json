  "description": "This walk from Ilmington makes use of three waymarked trails to create a fine circular route through the countryside surrounding the Cotswolds village. You'll follow sections of the Warwickshire Centenary Way , the Monarch's Way and the Cotswolds Link on this 10 mile tour of this lovely area of the Cotswolds. The walk starts in Ilmington at the noteworthy St. Marys church which is Norman and dates from about the middle of the 12th century. You pass through the pretty village with its thatched cottages and fish ponds, heading west into the countryside along the Warwickshire Centenary Way . At Admington you turn south along the Monarch's Way towards Hidcote Manor . The National Trust run gardens were created by American horticulturist, Major Lawrence Johnston and contain a number of beautifully designed outdoor 'rooms'. Highlights include the kitchen garden, plant house, herbaceous borders and the orchard. At the manor you pick up the Cotswold Link and follow it east along a series of bridleways. You'll pass Nebsworth and Knowlands Hill before coming to Darlingscott. The route turns north east here, taking you to Glebe Farm where you pick up the Centenary Way again and follow it west through Blackwell to Ilmington. After your exercise head to the Howard Arms Pub for some well earned refreshments. Peacefully overlooking the old chestnut tree on the green, it lies in the heart of the village at postcode CV36 4LT. It also includes a delightful beer garden where you can relax outside in the summer months. Just to the south of the route you can extend your walk by visiting Ebrington Hill and the Foxcote Estate . It's a lovely area with pretty streams, woodland and a lake near to the house. Look out for wildlife including buzzards, pheasants and deer.",
