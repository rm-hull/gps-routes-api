  "description": "The delightful village of Amberley is located at the foot of the South Downs, in the Horsham District of West Sussex. There's lots of lovely walking trails to follow through the surrounding countryside and along the River Arun. This circular walk makes use of the South Downs Way and Wey South Path long distance trails to take you along the river and through the surrounding South Downs countryside. It's about a 6 mile hike with some moderate hill climbs and great views to enjoy from the high points. The walk starts from the train station which is on the Arun Valley Line, with regular services to Bognor Regis Portsmouth and London. You could also start from the village centre if you prefer. After leaving the train station you head south along the river toward North Stoke. Here you turn east and follow country lanes to Camp Hill and The Burgh. The route then turns north to Downs Farm before heading into the village. It's very picturesque with several thatched houses and the 12th-century Amberley Castle. There's also the splendid Amberley Museum & Heritage Centre. Here you will find a 36-acre open-air museum, dedicated to the industrial heritage of South East England and with a special interest in aspects of the history of communications and transport. It's located next to the train station so you can pay a visit at the start or end of the walk. To extend your walking in the area head north from the village and visit the lovely Amberley Wild Brooks Nature Reserve. You could also head east along the South Downs Way and climb to Rackham Hill and Kithurst Hill. If you head west you can visit Eartham Woods and explore the expansive Slindon Estate. Here you'll find miles of footpaths and bridleways to follow through the 1400 hectare estate. There's also the Amberley to Arundel Walk which takes you along a lovely waterside footpath next to the River Arun.",

      "content": "Head a few miles east and you come to the neighbouring town of Storrington. The picturesque little town has a pretty mill pond and good access to the South Downs which is located just to the south. The circular Storrington Walk takes you onto the downs, climbing to Kithurst Hill where there's fine views to the coast from the summit. Just to the east there's Rackham village and Rackham Woods to explore. The route also visits the viewpoint at Rackham Hill and the fascinating Iron Age Urnfields containing the cremated remains of prehistory people in clay pots.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks and the South Downs Walks page."
