  "description": "Enjoy miles of traffic free cycling and walking trails in this super forest in the Lake District National Park. The route starts at the Bowness Knott car park next to the beautiful Ennerdale Water. You then head east into the forest along the lakeside path. After leaving the lake behind the track follows the River Liza into the forest to Ash Crag before returning along the south side of the river. The forest tracks are quite uneven in places so a mountain bike is required for cyclists. The views of Ennerdale valley are fabulous with some of the highest and best-known fells in Cumbria forming a spectacular backdrop - Great Gable, Green Gable, Brandreth, High Crag, Steeple and Pillar are all visible on the route. Just to the south of the forest is Pillar, the eighth highest mountain in the eighth highest mountain in the Lake District. You can climb to the peak from the forest via the striking Pillar Rock.",
