  "description": "This pretty country park in Enfield has some nice footpaths to follow around the parkland and woodland. Other features include an ornamental pond, small lakes and the Cuffley Brook which runs through the southern part of the park. You can park at the car park at Whitewebbs Road at the northern end of the park to start your walk. From here it's a short stroll to the large pond where there are picnic tables. Just beyond there is Whitewebbs House where there is a nice cafe. Other paths then lead towards the lake in the south western corner and through Whitewebbs Wood before returning to the car park. It's easy to extend your walk if you have time. The London Loop runs right through the park so you can pick this up and head to Clay Hill where you can enjoy a stroll along the Turkey Brook to Enfield Wash. Keep heading east and you will soon reach Lee Valley Park where you can enjoy a waterside stroll along King George's Reservoir. Heading west along the London Loop will soon bring you to Trent Country Park. Here you'll find 413 acres of rolling meadows, brooks, lakes and ancient woodland to explore on foot or by bike.",
