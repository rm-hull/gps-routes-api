  "description": "The Dartmoor town of Chagford is in a great position with several waymarked trails passing through the area. There's also riverside paths along the River Teign and several local hill climbs to try. This short walk to the south of the town, crosses Padley Common and Meldon Common before climbing Meldon Hill for splendid views over the area. The hill is covered with a number of different footpaths on which you can explore the summit. From all sides there are great views and the opportunity of seeing horses wandering across the common. After your walk enjoy a stroll through the delightful town. There's lots of arts and crafts galleries, several beautifully preserved 16th century buildings and nice pubs for refreshments after your exercise. Another great walk from Chagford is the hike to Castle Drogo, Fingle Bridge and Fingle Woods. They're all located just a few miles north east of the town and can be reached by following the Dartmoor Way along the river. The Two Moors Way also passes through the area. You can pick it up and head west to Teigncombe and the pretty Fernworthy Reservoir. It then crosses Chagford Common before climbing to Water Hill where there are more great views to enjoy from the elevated position.",

      "content": "A few miles north of the town there's the delightful Stone Lane Gardens. Here you'll find botanical gardens and an arboretum with many different types of trees and a series of lovely wooden sculptures. It's a tranquil place to go for a stroll and another of the area's worthy attractions. You can find the gardens about 1 mile due west of Drewseignton and just over 2 miles north of Chagord. The postcode is TQ13 8JU for your sat navs. If you follow the River Teign Walk west for about 4 miles you could visit the nearby Scorhill Stone Circle. The site is an English Heritage scheduled monument and has been described as Devon's finest, most intact stone circle. There's also the ancient Wallabrook Clapper Bridge to visit in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dartmoor Walks page."
