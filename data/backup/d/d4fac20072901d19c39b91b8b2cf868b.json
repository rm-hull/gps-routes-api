  "description": "The village of Bellingham is located in an attractive area of the Northumberland National Park. There's nice riverside trails along the River North Tyne which runs right through the village. You can also pick up the Pennine Way long distance trail or pay a visit to the Hareshaw Linn waterfall, just to the north of the village. This short walk takes you along a riverside path just to the west of Bellingham. It runs for about 1.5 miles on fairly flat paths to Cuddies Loup. On the way you'll pass the lovely Riverdale Hall which has a cricket field and salmon river in its own delightful grounds. There's also nice views of Dunterley Fell to enjoy on the way. Back in the village you can pay a visit to the Grade-I listed St Cuthbert's Church which dates from the 13th century. There's also Bellingham Bridge, a Grade II listed building built in 1834. The Heritage Centre is the local museum. It has exhibitions on the Border Counties Railway, the Border reivers, mining, farming, the photography of W P Collier, and the Stannersburn Smithy. To continue your walking in the area you can head west to explore the expansive Kielder Forest. There's miles of great cycling and walking trails here with a fantastic route around Kielder Water. The town is also not far from the epic Hadrian's Wall Path which is also located to the south of the town.",
