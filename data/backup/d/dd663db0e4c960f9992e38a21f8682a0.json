  "description": "The town of Uppingham is located in a pleasant position in Rutland. The town includes an attractive market place and many interesting buildings which include a notable public school, founded in 1584. This circular walk from the town takes you through the local countryside and woodland to the nearby Eyebrook Reservoir before a visit to the neighbouring villages of Stoke Dry and Lyddington. The walk starts in the town and follows country lanes and footpaths west past the Meteorological Station to King's Hill Lodge. You then head south west to Stockerston before turning south east to reach the reservoir. There's some nice paths to follow along the water with patches of woodland too. After exploring the reservoir area you head north east before heading east to visit Lyddington. Here you'll find Lyddington Bede House, owned by English Heritage. This Grade I listed building incorporates parts of a medieval bishop's palace. The remains of the fishponds of the bishop's palace are nearby. After exploring Lyddington you retrace your steps before turning north east towards Stoke Dry Wood. You head north along the edge of the wood before turning east to return to Uppingham.",
