  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Combs Reservoir near Chapel-en-le-Frith on the edge of the Peak District National Park. You can park on the western side of the reservoir and then follow the shoreline footpath towards the village of Combs. In the village you will find the Beehive pub which is a nice place to stop for refreshments. From Combs you follow more public footpaths through the countryside on the eastern side of the water before country lanes take you back to the car park. The walk can also be started from Chapel en le Frith railway station. You would follow public footpaths west through the countryside via Marshegreen farm. It's about a mile from the station to the reservoir. If you enjoy this walk then there are others you can try nearby. You could head north about a mile and climb Eccles Pike for splendid views over the Peak District. The Errwood and Fernilee Reservoirs Walk is just to the west where you can also explore the Errwood Estate with its old ruined hall and peaceful woodland with azaleas\u00a0and\u00a0rhododendrons.",
