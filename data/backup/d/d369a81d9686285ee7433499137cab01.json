  "description": "This walk takes you from the village of Tickton to the Leven Canal, using public footpaths along the River Hull. The route links the two East Riding villages using flat, waterside paths with nice countryside views on the way. The walk starts just to the east of Tickton where you can pick up the paths along the river. Follow the path on the eastern side north for about 2 miles and you will come to the Leven Canal. This runs east for just about 3 miles, taking you into Leven. The canal was in 1805, and remained in use until 1935. It is now a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It includes an aqueduct at Sandholme Farm, which carries the canal over a drainage ditch which was already in existence when the canal was built. It is grade II listed and is largely constructed from red bricks, and has three segmental arches. To continue your walking in the area you could try our River Hull Walk, which starts in Beverly and explores the Beverley Beck before heading to Tickton.",
