It is a very quiet, relaxing spot, where you can either take in the views or go for walk around the lakes. The walks takes you through the woods where there are more hidden surprises. Bursting with wild life, you may catch a glimpse of a rare species, a migrant bird. An ideal nature reserve, easily accessed from either the M25 or M23, good free parking, with refreshment available."

  "description": "This fine Surrey based village is a worthy place to visit for walkers and historians. The village includes a conservation area with many medieval buildings of interest. It is also located on the Greensand Ridge which can be explored on foot on the Greensand Way long distance trail. This circular walk from the village uses part of the trail to visit nearby Redhill where you can explore Redhill and Earlswood Common. The commons are a popular place for local walks with good footpaths and the pretty Earlswood Lakes to see. The walk then follows a traffic free section of National Cycle Route 21 to visit the wildlife rich Moors Nature Reserve and Mercers Country Park. Another local highlight the park includes a large boating lake and some pleasant walking trails. Scroll down for a list of other walks near and around the village. For more details on the historic buildings, local amenities and neighbouring settlements see the informative wikipedia page.",
