  "description": "This walk explores the Tudeley Woods RSPB Nature Reserve, near the village of Tudeley in Kent. The site is located just to the south east of Tonbridge and include some peaceful trails taking you around the ancient woodland. There's lots of flora and fauna to see including orchids, bluebells, tree pipits, woodlarks and nightjars. You can also see lots of butterflies fluttering around the wildflowers in the warmer months. The Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk runs past the eastern side of the woods. You can pick up this waymarked footpath to extend your walk if you have time. If you follow the trail south it will take you towards Tunbridge Wells via Pembury . The High Weald Landscape Trail can also be picked up in this area.",
