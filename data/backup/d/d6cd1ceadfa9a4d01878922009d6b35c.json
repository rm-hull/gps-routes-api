Here you can enjoy a popular circular walk around the loch where you'll pass the site of the Battle of Glen Trool in 1307. This is where Robert the Bruce with a few infantry let 1500 English soldiers with cavalry chase him up this south side of Glen Trool. At this point he had laid an ambush, the rest of his men rolled stones down this hillside to pitch men and horses into the loch, and followed up by attack with archers, so defeating the English."
