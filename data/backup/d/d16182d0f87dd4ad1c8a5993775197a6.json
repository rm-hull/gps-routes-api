  "description": "A circular walk around the village of Colan near Newquay. The walk takes you around the woodland and country lanes surrounding Porth Reservoir on the Colan Estate. The area is quite hilly so its an undulating walk with nice views across the reservoir from the high points. The parish also used to be a mining settlement so you may see several derelict buildings as you make your way through the area. The walk starts from Colan Church which dates from the thirteenth century. The trail then heads north east to Nanswhyden before turning east to Trebarer. Quiet country lanes then return you to the finish point at the church. To extend the walk you can pick up the circular trail around the pretty Porth Reservoir where there's an impressive dam and lots of wildlife to look out for.",

This shared cycling and walking trail explores the expansive Goss Moor National Nature Reserve where there's a number of rare plant and wildlife species to look out for. Just south of Newquay you can pick up the Holywell to Crantock Circular Walk to visit the lovely Holywell Bay and the secluded beach at Porth Joke. To the north of Newquay there's Watergate Bay where you will find a wonderful 2 mile long surfind beach and a footbridge over to the splendid Porth Island headland. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
