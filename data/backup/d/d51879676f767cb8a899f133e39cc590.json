The site is also notable as the largest natural loch in the Scottish Borders. You can park at the car park at the southern end of the loch. Near here you can pick up the Southern Upland Way and follow the waymarked footpath north along the eastern side of the water. On the way you will pass a large area of forest and Bowerhope Law hill. To the south there's also the Loch of the Lowes to explore.",

Head north to Peebles and you can pick up the Tweed Valley Railway Path and enjoy a walk or cycle along this multi user path. Head south west and you could visit the town of Moffat where you can enjoy a riverside walk along the River Annan on the Annadale Way.
