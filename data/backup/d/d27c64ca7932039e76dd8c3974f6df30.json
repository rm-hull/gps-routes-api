On Good Friday 26th April 1932 a miniature railway was opened circling the whole of the lake and travelling a distance of just over a mile. Two engines worked the line pulling open top carriagesand in 1935 a dining carriage was added. Sadly the end of the line came towards the end of 1938. This was the site of one of the three Lakeside Stations that worked the line during the 1930s. In 2003 the discovery of five concrete blocks inspired the re-creation of this small section of the railway in its disused state. (Extracted from the text on the information board) - The vertical boards presumably represent the waiting area on the platform."

  "description": "This delightful country park in Leeds has beautiful gardens, a lakeside walk, streams, ponds and peaceful woodland. It is also right next to two nature reserves - Breary Marsh and Adel Dam. There are very good facilities with a cafe (with indoor and outdoor seating), a bird feeding shelter and picnic benches. The park is on the Leeds Country Way so you could continue your walk east towards the lovely Eccup Reservoir which is about a mile away from the park. The Meanwood Valley Trail also starts from the park. The 7 mile trail runs to Woodhouse Moor in Leeds city centre, passing Adel Woods and Meanwood Park on the way. Golden Acre Park is located just a few miles north of Leeds city centre.",

      "content": "The on site cafe has a nice outdoor seating area where you can relax and enjoy refreshment on your walk. A short distance north east of the park you'll find the New Inn. The friendly pub does really good food and has a cosy fire indoors. Outdoors there's a large garen area to relax in on warmer days. To reach the pub just head past Thorn Bush Farm at the north western corner of the nearby Eccup Reservoir. The pub is located on Eccup Lane with a postcode of LS16 8AU for your sat navs."

      "content": "If you're coming by public transport one nice way of visiting the reservoir is to catch the train to Hosforth station. Near here you can pick up the Leeds Country Way and follow it east to the park. It's a couple of miles but it's a great way to visit the park without the car. The Bramhope Circular Walk visits the park and Eccup Reservoir from the nearby village. The attractive settlement is located just north of the park and includes a fine 18th century pub. You can follow the Ebor Way from here to the popular Otley Chevin Country Park, another of the area's walking highlights. Just to the north you can pay a visit to one of the architectural highlights of the area at Arthington Viaduct. The historic Grade II listed structure is well worth a visit with some nice walks along the River Wharfe to enjoy."
