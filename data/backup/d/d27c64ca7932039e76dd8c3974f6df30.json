The oldest one was made of wood, and got dilapidated over the years and was replace with a new one in 2004 or 2005 which can be seen in this picture 20716. Sadly it was burnt down in 2005, and has been replaced by a more durable but less elegant metal one."

On Good Friday 26th April 1932 a miniature railway was opened circling the whole of the lake and travelling a distance of just over a mile. Two engines worked the line pulling open top carriagesand in 1935 a dining carriage was added. Sadly the end of the line came towards the end of 1938. This was the site of one of the three Lakeside Stations that worked the line during the 1930s. In 2003 the discovery of five concrete blocks inspired the re-creation of this small section of the railway in its disused state. (Extracted from the text on the information board) - The vertical boards presumably represent the waiting area on the platform."

  "description": "This delightful country park in Leeds has beautiful gardens, a lakeside walk, streams, ponds and peaceful woodland. It is also right next to two nature reserves - Breary Marsh and Adel Dam. There are very good facilities with a cafe (with indoor and outdoor seating), a bird feeding shelter and picnic benches. The park is on the Leeds Country Way so you could continue your walk east towards the lovely Eccup Reservoir which is about a mile away from the park. The Meanwood Valley Trail also starts from the park. The 7 mile trail runs to Woodhouse Moor in Leeds city centre, passing Adel Woods and Meanwood Park on the way. Golden Acre Park is located just a few miles north of Leeds city centre.",
