  "description": "The epic circular walk to the 893\u00a0m (2,930\u00a0ft) summit of Cadair Idris is one of the most popular climbs in the Snowdonia National Park. This route follows the Minffordd Path and begins near the car park at Minffordd and the glacial Tal-y-llyn Lake . The area is part of a National Nature Reserve which includes woodland, streams, waterfalls and some wonderful geological formations such as the cliffs of Cwm Cau. The walk starts from the Dol Idris Car Park at the junction of the A487 & B4405 (postcode: LL36 9AJ). There's plenty of parking here with toilets facilities also. From here you can easily pick up the Minffordd Path which will guide you up to the summit. You begin the walk with a lovely woodland section with streams and waterfalls before ascending towards the stunning Llyn Cau . This beautiful lake is surrounded by huge cliffs and is a breathtaking sight, particularly when viewed from above. You continue around the lake towards Penygadair\u00a0- the highest point on the mountain. From here there are magnificent views of the Barmouth estuary, the Cambrian Mountains, the Brecon Beacons, the Rhinogs and the rest of Snowdonia National Park. You continue east to Mynydd Moel and descend towards Moelfryn, crossing the Nant Cadair\u00a0before returning to the car park through the woodland. After your hike you can enjoy refreshments at the splendid Ty Te Cadair Tea Room where there's outdoor seating with great views. To further explore the mountain head to Cregennan Lakes on the northern slopes. There's a nice footpath round the lovely lakes with the the Cadair Idris Visitor Centre also located near by. The centre includes a wealth of information and an\u00a0exhibition detailing the wildlife and geology\u00a0of this fascinating area.",
