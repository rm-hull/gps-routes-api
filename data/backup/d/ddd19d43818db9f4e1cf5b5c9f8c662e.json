  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful riverside walk or cycle along the River Biss in this lovely country park in Trowbridge. The park has a series of nicely laid out paths so makes for a nice traffic free cycle or walk. Biss Meadows is located very near Trowbridge town centre so is easily accessible. There's also a variety of wildlife with herons and Kingfishers visitors to the park. To continue your walking in the town you could try our Trowbridge Park and River Walk and visit the lovely sensory garden just to the north of Biss Meadows. Just to the west is Southwick Country Park which has some good trails to take you around the 100 acre site.",
