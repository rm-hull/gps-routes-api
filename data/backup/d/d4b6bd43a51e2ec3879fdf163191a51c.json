  "description": "This is a popular coastal walk from Torquay to the lovely Babbacombe Downs. It's about a 6 mile hike along an undulating section of the South West Coast Path. The route is fairly flat but there are some moderate climbs so a reasonable level of fitness is required. Along the way there's wonderful cliff top views, pretty beaches and some nice woodland sections. At Babbacombe you'll find the Babbacombe Model Village, a pretty cliff top green and the Babbacombe Cliff Railway which will take you down to the attractive Oddicombe Beach. You can either return the same way or catch the bus back to Torquay. The route starts on Corbyn Beach in Torquay, just a short hop from the train station. You head east along a pretty stretch of the English Riviera, passing the Grand Hotel and the marina with its rows of boats and yachts. You continue past Meadfoot Beach to the headland at Hope's Nose. Here you will find an area of geological significance with limestone rocks, lots of fossils and great views. From Hope's Nose you turn north to Black Head before passing along the lovely Babbacombe cliff top path with well laid out gardens and more great views. To extend the walk you can continue north to Maidencombe and Teignmouth, where you can enjoy a riverside walk along the River Teign. If you head along the other coast you can visit Paignton and Brixham on the Torquay to Brixham Walk. Also in Torquay is Cockington Country Park with its ornamental lakes, woodlands and formal gardens.",

      "content": "Near the start you could try the popular Torquay Rock Walk. These elevated, Mediterranean style gardens command wonderful views across the town and the bay. Head north from Torquay along the coast path and you can pay a visit to the lovely RSPB nature reserve at Labrador Bay near Shaldon. There's great views here and lots of wildlife to see including cirl buntings and dolphins. On the northern side of Torquay you could visit the peaceful Brunel Woods. The site is named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel who loved the area and intended to set up home at Watcombe Park before he died. The John Musgrave Heritage Trail can be picked up in this area too. The waymarked trail runs from Maidencombe to Brixham, visiting several of South Devon's interesting historical sites on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
