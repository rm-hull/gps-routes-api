  "description": "This walk visits the photogenic Wilder's Folly at Nunhide near Sulham in Berkshire. There are some nice footpaths to follow around old dovecote with good views of the surrounding countryside. The site can be found just to the west of Reading. You can start the walk from the car parking area in Sulham Woods, just to the north of the folly. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south towards Little Heath before turning west towards the folly. The structure was built in 1769 by Reverend Henry Wilder (1744\u20131814) while he was courting Joan Thoyts. It was positioned so they could both see it from their own homes. From the hill top you can enjoy views towards Sulham House through the south arch of Wilder's Folly looking north. There's also fine views over the fields and some nice bluebell woodland to enjoy on the way.",
