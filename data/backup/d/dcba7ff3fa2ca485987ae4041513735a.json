  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Fife Coastal Path from Kirkcaldy to Kinghorn. It's a fairly flat walk, running for just over 4 miles along a well maintained footpath. The walk starts from the public car park just south of the historic Kirkcaldy Castle and the lovely Ravenscraig Park. From here you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it south past the harbour, the pier and the docks to Kirkcaldy Sands. You continue along the beach past Linktown to the remains of Seafield Tower before finishing at Kinghorn Harbour. Near here you'll pass some interesting rock formations. You could extend your outing by heading north to visit Kinghorn Loch where there's a waterside path to try.",
