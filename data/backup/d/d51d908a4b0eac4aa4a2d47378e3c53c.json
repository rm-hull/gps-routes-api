  "description": "This pretty village is located in a lovely spot on the Somerset Levels. It's close to walking trails along the River Axe and River Brue, with the Mendip Hills and the wildlife rich Avalon Marshes also not far away. This walk from Wedmore heads north to visit two of the walking highlights of the county at Cheddar Reservoir and Cheddar Gorge. The walk starts in the village and heads east on public footpaths across Wedmore Moor to the River Axe. You then head north along the river, passing Cocklake and Clewer Bridge. You continue along the Broadmoor Drove before coming to Puddleham Corner at Brinscombe. The route then turns east along the Stubbington Drove to Cheddar Reservoir which lies in between the settlements of Axbridge and Cheddar. Follow the trail east and it will take you through Cheddar to the wonderful Cheddar Gorge. The geoligcally fascinating area is a great place for walks and taking spectacular photos. After exploring the area you can then catch a bus back to Wedmore.",
