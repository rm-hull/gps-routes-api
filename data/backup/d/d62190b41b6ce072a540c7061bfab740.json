  "description": "Enjoy a short riverside walk along the  River Wharfe in the market town of Otley in Leeds. The walk takes you through some of the parks and nature reserves located next to the river. Start the walk from the Beech Hill car park and then head through Manor Garth Park to the river. You'll soon come to the bridge where you can cross to the northern side of the Wharfe. Head east and you will soon come to the riverside park where there is a pretty weir and the Weirside cafe. You continue through the Wharfemeadows Park where you cross on a footbridge to the southern side of the water. Here you can visit the Gallows Hill Nature Reserve where there are good wildlife spotting opportunites. After exploring the reserve the route then returns to the car park on the same paths. The town is well know for the lovely Otley Chevin Country Park. It's located just to the south of the town and a great place to continue your walking. The park rises to a height of 280m above sea level, offering fabulous views of the Wharfe Valley and the town below. Just to the north east of Otley you will find the pretty Lindley Wood Reservoir. There are nice footpaths along the River Washburn and the peaceful Lindley Wood to enjoy here.",
