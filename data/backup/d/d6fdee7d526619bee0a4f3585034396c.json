  "description": "This town in South Gloucestershire is well served by several waymarked footpaths. There's also some nice trails along the river Frome and several interesting old villages to visit nearby. The town is positioned close to the Cotswolds Hills where there are miles of great walking trails. This circular walk from the town visits the River Frome, the market town of Chipping Sodbury , the historic village of Old Sodbury and the old quarries at Yate Rocks. The route uses sections of the Monarch's Way , the Cotswold Way and the Frome Valley Walkway . These waymarked long distance trails all run past the town and provide an opportunity to explore the surrounding area. For example you could follow the river path west to visit the neighbouring village of Iron Acton . Here you'll find an historic church, riverside walks, a lovely garden centre and a noteworthy pub dating back to the 17th century.",
