  "description": "Enjoy the coastline and surrounding countryside of this famous seaside resort on this interesting circular walk. You will pass beaches, the famous Golden Mile with its numerous tourist attractions and the longest pier in the world on the coastal stretch which starts at Southend Tourist Information Centre. Highlights on the walk include Southend's pretty cliff gardens near the start. The elevated park includes formal and informal gardens with beautiful views across the Thames Estuary. You'll also visit Hadleigh Country Park and the ruins of the 13th century Hadleigh Castle before heading inland through the attractive Essex Countryside, passing through Rochford on the way. You then return to the coast for another pleasant coastal stretch through Thorpe Bay before finishing back at the Tourist information centre in Southend. To continue your walking in the area you can try the Benfleet to Leigh on Sea Walk which visits the sea wall on Hadleigh Marshes. The route also passes close to Two Tree Island which is located just a short stroll from Leigh on Sea. The expansive nature reserve includes lagoons, pretty streams and great views across Hadleigh Ray to Canvey Island. If you were to continue east along the coast you would soon come to Shoeburyness . It's an interesting place for a walk with a beach, interesting old buildings, a nature reserve and the Shoebury Old Ranges to explore.",
