The historical folly dates back to the 18th century. It was constructed to commemorate the British colony of Vandalia, a colony that eventually disappeared as the American colonies evolved. The Vandalian Tower is situated on the summit of Tower Hill and serves as a fascinating relic of the past. This folly, with its unique design and historical significance, adds a distinctive charm to the landscape."

  "description": "This West Sussex village is located to the south east of Petersfield in the Chichester district of the county. This circular walk from the village visits one of the local walking highlights at Harting Down. The chalk downland nature reserve is run by the National Trust. There's a wide variety of flora and fauna with some excellent views over the South Downs from the high points. Part of the walk uses The South Downs Way National Trail which can be picked up just to the south of the village. The village also lies close to Uppark. Here you'll find a fine 17th century Georgian House surrounded by lovely gardens with views of the English Channel. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around South Harting.
