Lord Melbourne, Prime Minister to Queen Victoria, inherited the house and estate in 1828. His name was given to Melbourne, Australia."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the area to the south of the Derbyshire town of Mlebourne. It's a very pretty area with parkland and the popular Melbourne Pool to see. Start the walk at the southern fringes of the town where you can pick up a public footpath heading around the pool. You can also branch off to the east to visit Chestnut Park near Wilson. These paths are free to access but for a fee you can explore the adjacent Melbourne Hall. The gardens here are certainly noteworthy with broad sweeps of lawn, avenues and fine vistas. It's regarded as one of the best known historic gardens in the country and the best surviving early 18th century English garden in the manner of Le Notre. The gardens surround the Georgian hall which is notable as the former home of prime minister Lord Melbourne. His name was then given to the city of Melbourne, Australia. It's easy to extend the walk if you have time. Staunton Harold Reservoir is located just a few metres south west of the pool. There's a super walking trail here and an excellent cafe for refreshments. The National Trust's beautiful Calke Abbey and the expansive Foremark Reservoir are also nearby.",

      "content": "Just over a mile north of the town you can pick up the Trent and Mersey Canal near Weston-on-Trent. There's some nice easy cycling and walking along the towpath here. Just to the south east of the town you'll find the noteworthy little village of Breedon on the Hill. Here you can try the circular Breedon Hill Walk which climbs to the village's limestone hill. Here you'll find a fascinating ancient church and an Iron Age Hillfort. You can also visit a splendid 16th century village pub after your exercise. Just to the north east there's the interesting market town of Castle Donington to explore. Here you can visit Donington Park which is famously used as a motor racing track and is also the venue for the Download Music Festival.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Derbyshire Walks page."
