  "description": "This pretty Lake District village sits on the River Irt in the western part of the National Park. This circular walk from the village takes you to the viewpoints at Irton Pike and Irton Fell before exploring the adjacent Miterdale Forest. You can follow trails east from the village to Irton Pike which stands at 751 feet (229 m). From here there are great views towards Wast Water to the north east. The route then continues east across Mecklin Park to Irton Fell with fabulous views of the surrounding lakeland fells as you go. You can then head south into Miterdale Forest where there are miles of peaceful woodland trails and views of the River Mite at the southern end.",
