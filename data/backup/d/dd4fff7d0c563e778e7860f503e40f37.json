  "description": "The villages of Great Bedwyn and Pewsey are located on a lovely stretch of the Kennet and Avon Canal in the North Wessex Downs area of Wiltshire. It's a nice walk to do between the two setttlements with several other pretty villages located along the canal too. Great Bedwyn is also an interesting historical place with a noteworthy 12th century church and a fine old pub. This walk from the village first strolls along the Kennet and Avon Canal Walk to nearby Wilton where you can visit the Wilton Windmill , the only working windmill in Wessex. It then continues to Burbage and Pewsey.  It's a fairly easy walk which takes place on mostly flat paths along the canal towpath. On the way there's a series of pretty locks and bridges plus views of the River Dun which flows alongside the canal. Start the walk at the train station which is located right next to the canal. You can then pick up the towpath and follow it south to Mill Bridge and Crofton. Here you leave the canal to follow footpaths south east past the pretty Wilton Water to Wilton village. From here it is a short stroll to visit the photogenic Wilton Windmill. The route then returns to the canal and continues west past Freewarren Bridge to Wolfhall Bridge. Here you leave the canal and head south along a footpath a country lane to reach the village of Burbage. After exploring the village you return to the canal and continue west to Wooton Rivers before coming into Pewsey.",
