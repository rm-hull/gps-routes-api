  "description": "The villages of Great Bedwyn and Pewsey are located on a lovely stretch of the Kennet and Avon Canal in the North Wessex Downs area of Wiltshire. It's a nice walk to do between the two setttlements with several other pretty villages located along the canal too. Great Bedwyn is also an interesting historical place with a noteworthy 12th century church and a fine old pub. This walk from the village first strolls along the Kennet and Avon Canal Walk to nearby Wilton where you can visit the Wilton Windmill, the only working windmill in Wessex. It then continues to Burbage and Pewsey. It's a fairly easy walk which takes place on mostly flat paths along the canal towpath. On the way there's a series of pretty locks and bridges plus views of the River Dun which flows alongside the canal. Start the walk at the train station which is located right next to the canal. You can then pick up the towpath and follow it south to Mill Bridge and Crofton. Here you leave the canal to follow footpaths south east past the pretty Wilton Water to Wilton village. From here it is a short stroll to visit the photogenic Wilton Windmill. The route then returns to the canal and continues west past Freewarren Bridge to Wolfhall Bridge. Here you leave the canal and head south along a footpath a country lane to reach the village of Burbage. After exploring the village you return to the canal and continue west to Wooton Rivers before coming into Pewsey.",

      "content": "On the route you'll also pass the noteworthy Crofton Pumping Station which is one of the most significant industrial heritage sites in the UK. You can learn about the industrial and social history of the area at this interesting site. It dates from 1812 and is the oldest working beam engine in the world. The steam-powered pumping station is well preserved and operates on selected weekends. If you follow the canal north it will take you to Little Bedwyn and then to Hungerford where you can pick up the Newbury to Kintbury and Hungerford Canal Walk and enjoy some pleasant trails across Hungerford Common. In Pewsey you can pick up the Pewsey Avon Trail which takes you along the river to the historical city of Salisbury with its magnificent cathedral. The Pewsey Walk will take you along the canal and then into the countryside of the Vale of Pewsey and onto Pewsey Downs where there are splendid views from the high points. The little village of Chilton Foliat is located a few miles to the north near Hungerford. It's a lovely place for a stroll with several pretty thatched cottages, wildlife rich marshland and nice views of the River Kennet which runs through the settlement. Near here you can also visit Littlecote House, another of the area's highlights. The house dates from the mid 16th century and is surrounded by beautiful parkland and gardens. There's also a wonderful ancient Roman mosaic and the opportunity to enjoy afternoon tea at the historic house which is now run as an hotel. For more walking ideas in the area see the Wiltshire Walks and North Wessex Downs Walks pages."
