  "description": "Explore 165 acres of ancient woodland on this circular walk through Whippendell Woods in Watford. There are a series of good trails to follow with an avenue of lime trees dating back to 1672. Other trees include oak, beech, ash and silver birch. In the spring months the woods are covered with huge numbers of pretty bluebells. The area is also very good for wildlife spotting. Look out for birds such as woodpeckers, tawny owls and sparrow hawks. Other creatures you might see  include bats, badgers and deer. The woods were used as the location for The Gungan Forest in Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace. The video on the page shows scenes from the film. This walk starts at the car park, just off Grove Mill Lane and takes you on a circuit around the outskirts of the wood. It's easy to extend your walk if you have time. You can head a mile east to the nearby Cassiobury Park crossing the Grand Union Canal on the way. Also nearby is Chipperfield Common where you'll find waymarked, woodland walking trails to try.",
