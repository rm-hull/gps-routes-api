  "description": "This walk visits the Shian Woodland Wildlife Reserve at the southern end of Loch Creran. There's some peaceful waymarked woodland trails here with spring wildflowers and lots of butterflies to see. At the eastern side there's a nice country lane which is suitable for walking and cycling along the loch. The circular walk starts and finishes at the reserve car park. To continue your walking around the loch head to the eastern side where you can visit the Sutherland's Grove Forest Walks. There's another car park here with trails leading east towards the pretty Glen Dubh Reservoir. The area includes picturesque streams with waterfalls and more woodland wildlife to see.",
