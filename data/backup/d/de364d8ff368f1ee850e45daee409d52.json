  "description": "This Denbighshire based town is positioned in a lovely area with easy walks along the River Dee and more challenging climbs into the surrounding Berwyn Mountains. The town is also the start point for several popular long distance walking trails and  designated as a Walkers are Welcome town. Corwen has strong connections with Owain Glyndwr, the last native-born Prince of Wales. A large statue of the warrior can be found in the town square. This route from the town uses sections of the Clwydian Way , the Dee Valley Way , the Brenig Way and the North Berwyn Way to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. On the way there are nice views of the River Dee and the Berwyn Mountains. You'll also enjoy a climb to the fine viewpoint at Moel Fferna. The walk starts in the town centre and heads north to cross the River Dee on Corwen Bridge. Here you meet up with the Clwydian Way and follow the waymarked footpath east to Rhagatt Hall and the neighbouring villlage of Carrog . The route then heads south, crossing the river and passing through the woodland of the Carrog Plantation before climbing to Moel Fferna. The 630 metre high mountain is the most northern outpost of the Berwyn range. At the mountain you pick up the North Berwyn Way and follow the trail west to Cynwyd, passing through the Cynwyd Forest and enjoying views of the waterfalls on the Afon Trystion. At Cynwyd you pick up a riverside path heading north along the Dee to return you to Corwen.",
