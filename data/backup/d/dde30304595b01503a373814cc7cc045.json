  "description": "This circular walk on the South Devon coast visits Gara Rock from East Portlemouth. You could also start from the Gara Rock car park at postcode TQ8 8FA for your sat navs. It's a beautiful area with a cliff top hotel and a peaceful beach to enjoy. The walk starts from the public car park at East Portlemouth and follow a footpath south west to Small's Cove where you can pick up the South West Coast Path. Follow the waymarked trail south along Salcombe Harbour to Mill Bay, Biddlehead Point, Rickham Common and Limebury Point. Here you turn east passing Leek Cove before heading across Portlemouth Down to Rudder Cove, Abraham's Cove and Gara Rock. There's a fine hotel here and a lovely secluded beach which you can walk down to on a steep slope. The route then turns inland, following a bridleway to Rickham before returning to the coast near East Portlemouth.",
