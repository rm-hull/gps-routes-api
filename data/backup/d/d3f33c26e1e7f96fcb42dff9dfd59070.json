  "description": "This Staffordshire based market town is in an ideal spot for exploring the countryside and woodland of the Cannock Chase AONB. There's also some nice waterside walking along the canal towpath and the River Penk which run through the town. The historic town itself is also worth exploring with a Grade I listed medieval church, the Penkridge Railway Viaduct and the Old Market Square to see. This walk from Penkridge takes you along the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and the Staffordshire Way to one of the highlights of the area at the nearby Cannock Chase Country Park. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the Staffordshire Way and follow the waymarked footpath north along the canal towpath. At Parkgate Lock you turn north east to head through Teddesley Hall Park. This was the site large Georgian English country house which has since been demolished, though traces of the hall, gardens and park still remain. The trail passes through the old park where there's picturesque pools, woodland and farmland. After passing through the park you will come to the little village of Bednall before climbing Sycamore Hill and finishing in the Oldacre Valley in Cannock Chase Country Park.",

      "content": "If you head west along the Staffordshire Way it will take you to Preston Vale, Whiston, Bickford, Mitton, Lapsey and Belvide Reservoir. There's more nice waterside trails around this pretty lake. If you follow the canal north it will take you into Stafford via Acton Trussell. Here you can visit the Stafford Castle and enjoy walks along the River Sow. Follow the towpath south and you can visit the Galley Reservoirs, Calf Heath Reservoir and Wolverhampton. Near Cannock Chase Country Park you can pick up several long distance trails including the Two Saints Way, the Heart of England Way and the Sabrina Way. Milford Common is also nearby and has a series of decent trails to try. If you follow the canal south from the town it will take you to the Gailey Reservoirs, the home of South Staffordshire Sailing Club.
