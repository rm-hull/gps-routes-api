  "description": "Explore this area of the Piethorne Valley on this circular walk in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, Greater Manchester. There's a nice walking trail taking you around Ogden Reservoir, Kitcliffe Reservoir and Piethorne Reservoir. You'll climb above the reservoirs and enjoy wonderful views over the surrounding countryside. There's also waterfalls, woodland and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The Rochdale Way and the Pennine Bridleway both pass the reservoirs so you can pick up these trails to further explore the Piethorne Valley. If you head north you will pass Tunshill Hill, Dick Hill, the Longden End Brook and Rakewood before coming to the lovely Hollingworth Lake . The large lake has a nice waterside footpath and a nature reserve with lots of birdlife to look out for. About 2.5 miles to the south east you will find Castleshaw Reservoirs . There's nice trails here around the upper and lower reservoirs, with parking available at the Castleshaw Centre. Ogden and Piethorne Reservoirs are located near Newhey and Oldham.",
