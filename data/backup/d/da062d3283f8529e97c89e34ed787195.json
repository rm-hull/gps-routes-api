  "description": "This picturesque riverside village sits in a nice location within the North York Moors National Park, on the River Esk. It's also on the heritage Esk Valley Railway and includes two fine inns. As such it's a great place to start a walk into the surrounding countryside. This circular walk takes you from Egton Bridge to Grosmont. The walk runs for about 4 miles, following country lanes to the neighbouring village. It's a very pretty area with views of the River Esk and the countryside from the high points. The walk starts at the train station on the Esk Valley Railway. You then follow a country lane east past Egton Manor, Priory Farm and the Alders before coming to Grosmont. The route then turns west, passing the old railway shed and Lease Rigg before picking up a country lane to Key Green. Here you turn north to return to Egton Bridge.",
