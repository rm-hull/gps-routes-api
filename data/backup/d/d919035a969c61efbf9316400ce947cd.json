  "description": "This is a popular walk visiting the lovely tarns on Finsthwaite Heights, near Newby Bridge on the south western edge of the Lake District. It's a short walk but there is some moderate climbing involved to reach the tarns. Start the walk from the car park, just to the north of the little village of Finsthwaite. From here you can pick up footpaths running along Finsthwaite Water to Low Dam and High Dam. There's some nice woodland trails running all the way around the tarn. The paths then descend past Finsthwaite Heights before returning to the car park. From the car park you can extend your outing by visiting the Stott Park Bobbin Mill. The working mill produced millions of wooden bobbins vital to the Lancashire spinning and weaving industries. It is the only working bobbin mill left in the Lake District today. You can learn about the history of the mill through tours and an exhibition. To continue your walking you could try the longer Newby Bridge Circular Walk which starts from the village and includes views of the River Leven and Windermere Lake.",
