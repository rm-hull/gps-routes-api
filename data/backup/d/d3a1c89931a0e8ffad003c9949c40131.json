      "caption": "Stoodley Pike, local landmark and highlight on the walk. The site was probably used for bronze age burials, since bones were found when excavating for the first circular tower. This was built in 1815 to celebrate the peace at the end of the Napoleonic war. Unfortunately, it collapsed when the next war started, on the day the Russian ambassador left London before the Crimean War. The present monument was built in 1856. You can climb up the inner spiral staircase counting 39 steps in the dark to get a great view. It may also have been a beacon site. A beacon was temporarily put up and lit on 19th July 1988 to commemorate the great chain of beacons 400 years earlier, when the Spanish Armada was sighted off the southern coast."

  "description": "This is a splendid circular walk through the beautiful Calder Valley from the market town of Todmorden in West Yorkshire. The walk takes you across a series of atmospheric moors and past several lovely reservoirs, including Ramsden Clough and Warland reservoirs. There are also waterside sections to enjoy along the Rochdale Canal before a visit to the noteworthy Stoodley Pike. This 1,300ft hill includes the Stoodley Pike Monument at the summit. It was built in 1856 when peace was declared at the end of the Crimean War and is a major highlight on the walk.",
