  "description": "This Powys based village is located close to the River Usk on the edge of the Brecon Beacons. This long circular walk from the village takes you west to visit Trecastle Mountain where you will find the ancient Roman site of Y Pigwn. The site consists of two overlaying Roman practice marching camps and sits at a height of 412 metres. You can reach the mountain by following the Roman Road west from the village. It's a historically significant location having been described as 'amongst the best-preserved and best-known Roman temporary camps in Wales'. On the way you will also pass Mynydd Bach stone circle. From here you can continue west to Mynydd Myddfai before descending to the Usk Reservoir. Here you can enjoy some lovely waterside footpaths and miles of peaceful woodland trails through the surrounding woodland of the Glasfynydd Forest. There's also fine views over the water to the surrounding peaks of the Black Mountains. On the western side of the reservoir you can extend your walking by picking up the Cambrian Way. This can then be followed north to visit Llandovery where there are nice riverside walks along the River Towy and River Bran. You can also pick up the Heart of Wales Line Trail in this area.",
