  "description": "This circular walk in Ealing climbs to Horsenden Hill. The hill reaches a height of 85m / 276 ft commanding fine views over the city of London. It's a lovely place for a walk with areas of meadows, woodland, grassland and wetland attracting a large variety of wildlife. After climbing the hill you can continue your walk in the western part of the site where you will find wildflower meadows, hedgerows and the Grand Union Canal. The Horsenden Hill site also includes a new Gruffalo trail for children. Look out for a series of delightful wooden sculptures representing the characters from the book. You can pick up the footpaths from the car park off Horsenden Lane North. Perivale and Sudbury Town tube stations are also nearby. The Capital Ring long distance walking trail crosses the hill so you can pick this up to extend your walk. If you follow the path north you will soon come to Sudbury Hill. Head south and you can visit Pitshanger Park and the Perivale Wood nature reserve. The pretty reserve consists of oak woodland, pasture, damp scrub, three ponds and two streams. It's only a 5 minute stroll from the car park and well worth a visit if you have time. The Grand Union Canal also passes to south of the hill. You can pick up the waterside path and head west to Northolt or east towards Alperton. At Northolt you can visit Northala Fields with its lakes, streams and four distinctive hills made out of the rubble from the old Wembley Stadium",
