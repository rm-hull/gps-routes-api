  "description": "This circular walk on the Isle of Anglesey visits the fascinating disused copper mines of Parys Mountain. The mountain was mined for copper ore in the early Bronze Age and dominated the world's copper market during the 1780s, when the mine was the largest in Europe. The mines are an extraordinary sight, rich with various ores and minerals. The striking mixture of colours and shadows from the undulating hills are very picturesque. From the elevated position there are wonderful views of the Anglesey coast and countryside. There is also an old windmill and a number of pools/ponds. Cyclists can reach the mountain by following the wonderful Copper Trail Cycle Route which is named after the mountain. The walk starts from the little village of Penysarn where there is a car park (You could also start from the car park at the northern end of the mountain on the B5111. This is shown on the street view link below).You then follow waymarked footpaths around the mountain with views towards Almwich Port to the north and the nearby Trysglwyn wind farm to the south. A unique walk it is well worth bringing your camera to capture this extraordinary landscape.",
