  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Gullane to North Berwick using the coastal path on the outward journey and a section of the John Muir Way on the return leg. There's lovely beaches, sand dunes and splendid views across the Firth of Forth to a series of islands, including the RSPB's Fidra Island. The walk starts at the Gullane Bents Car Park next to Gullane Beach. You can then head along the coastal dunes to Black Rocks and the woodland at Jamie's Neuk. You continue north along the famous Muirfield Golf Course , one of the courses used in rotation for\u00a0The Open Championship. You continue to Weaklow Rocks and Longskelly Rocks where there are fine views north to the Brigs of Fidra and Fidra Island. You continue along Broad Sands before picking up the John Muir Way and following it into North Berwick. You can then follow the inland path west to Gullane, passing the ruined Dirleton Castle on the way. You can continue your walking along the coast path on the Aberlady Bay to Gullane Walk . This will take you along the wildlife rich Aberlady Bay, the first Local Nature Reserve to be founded in Britain in 1952.",
