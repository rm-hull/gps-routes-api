  "description": "This large Berkshire based village has some pleasant waterside walks along its Rivers and Lakes. This circular walk explores the Loddon Nature Reserve and the Charvil Country Park. These sites are both located on the western side of the village and have good footpaths taking you around a series of lakes and pools. There's also trails along the River Loddon with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The area is particularly good for wildfowl with gadwall, tufted duck, pochard and snipe to see on the water. The walk starts from the Wagon and Horses pub at the northern end of the reserve. It's located a short walk west from Twyford Train Station. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south along the river and the lakes which are formed from flooded gravel pits. Continue south to Copper Bridge and you can then turn around and follow footpaths north through Charvil Country Park. At the northern end of the park you'll also find Charvil Water Meadows which is another nature reserve on the London floodplain.",

      "content": "Head west of the village and you'll soon come to the River Thames at Sonning. Here you can pick up the Thames Path National Trail and enjoy an easy riverside stroll into Reading and Caversham where you can visit the delightful Caversham Court Gardens. Here you can also pick up the Reading Canal Walk which will take you along the towpath of the Kennet and Avon Canal. You can also join with the Reading Circular River Walk here too. Follow the river south for about a mile and you will come to Dinton Pastures Country Park. The park has a number of trails around a series of pretty lakes. Just to the north there's the worthy village of Wargrave. It's well worth a visit with a historic high street with many old listed buildings, a picturesque marina, a 12th century church and a very fine riverside pub where you can relax with a view of the river. The Knowl Hill Bridleway can be picked up in Twyford. The circular cycling and walking route explores the area around Knowl Hill, with some fine views from the high points. For more walking ideas in the area see the Berkshire Walks page."
