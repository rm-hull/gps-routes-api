  "description": "This large Berkshire based village has some pleasant waterside walks along its Rivers and Lakes. This circular walk explores the Loddon Nature Reserve and the Charvil Country Park. These sites are both located on the western side of the village and have good footpaths taking you around a series of lakes and pools. There's also trails along the River Loddon with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The area is particularly good for wildfowl with gadwall, tufted duck, pochard and snipe to see on the water. The walk starts from the Wagon and Horses pub at the northern end of the reserve. It's located a short walk west from Twyford Train Station. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south along the river and the lakes which are formed from flooded gravel pits. Continue south to Copper Bridge and you can then turn around and follow footpaths north through Charvil Country Park. At the northern end of the park you'll also find Charvil Water Meadows which is another nature reserve on the London floodplain.",
