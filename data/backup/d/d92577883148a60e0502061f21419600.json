  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Twmbarlwm hill fort, near Risca in South Wales. It's a well known local landmark that is also known as Twm Barlwm, Twyn Barlwm or \"the Twmp\" (the Pimple). You can start the walk from the parking area, located just to the west of the hill on Cwmcarn Forest Forest Drive. From here it is a short climb to the summit of the hill which stands at a height of 419 m (1,375 ft). Here you'll find the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort and superb views over South Wales to the Bristol Channel. It's a lovely area with a series of footpaths and steps to explore the hill fort on. After taking in the views the route descends through the woodland surrounding the hill before picking up a section of the Raven Walk to take you back to the parking area. The route could also be started from the Cwmcarn Forest Visitor Centre which is only a short distance from the hill.",
