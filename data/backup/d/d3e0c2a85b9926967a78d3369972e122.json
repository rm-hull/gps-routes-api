  "description": "This walk from the West Sussex village of Handcross explores the public footpaths surrounding the lovely Hyde Estate. It then goes on to explore the expansive Tilgate Country Park to the north. The Hyde Estate is a wonderful secluded estate currently used for weddings but there are some public access trails you can follow around the site. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the High Weald Landscape Trail and follow the waymarked footpath south to Slaugham passing the beautiful Nymans Gardens which are also well worth a visit. Slaugham is also worth exploring with its pretty mill pond, old church and the atmospheric ruins of Slaugham Place. You then head north west to Warren Wood and Carterslodge Pond on the edge of the Hyde Estate. Here you cross a bridge over the pond before continuing north with Newstead Gill and St Leonard's Forest on your left. At the Shelley cottages you turn east, passing through Bensonhill Wood before coming to Tilgate Forest. The route then heads north to Tilgate Country Park before finishing at the pretty lake.",
