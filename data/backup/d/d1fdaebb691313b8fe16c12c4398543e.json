  "description": "Truro is notable as Cornwall's only city and mainland Britain's southernmost city. It is well known for its Gothic-revival cathedral and some wonderful Georgian architecture. There's also some nice walks to be found with a local nature reserve, some nearby woods and easy riverside trails to enjoy. This walk takes you from the city centre, along the Truro River to nearby Malpas, visiting Boscawen park on the way. The walk starts from the 19th century cathedral and heads south along a footpath running along the river and the Malpas Road. Follow the paths south and they will take you to Boscawen Park. This pretty riverside park has some nice trails, wide lawns, formal floral bedding displays and good views back down the river to Truro. There's also some tennis courts and a cafe if you wish to stop for some refreshments. On the other side of the park there's Trennick Mill where you'll find a picturesque duck pond which is laid out to shrub and herbaceous borders and maintained with wildlife in mind. After exploring the park you can continue further south along the river to the village of Malpas. This riverside village sits in a pleasant spot at the confluence of the Truro River and the Tresillian River . There is a pub here where you could stop for a drink before retracing your steps to Truro. On the route look out for a variety of birds, particularly around the estuary at Malpas. You can see Egrets, Curlews, Ospreys and Grey Heron in this area.",
