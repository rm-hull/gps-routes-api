Eventually the sea will break through the gap to Worbarrow Beach on the far side, leaving Worbarrow Tout as an island - a larger version of the Mupe Rocks on the far side of the bay (just about visible in the distance). The Isle of Portland is just visible in the hazy far distance. The concrete blocks at the head of the cove are anti-tank defences, relics from the Second World War."

After the war the range was kept open and the villagers could not return. The building has been 'made safe' so that the public can go inside when the village is open."

  "description": "This circular walk in Dorset visits the deserted village of Tyneham before heading along the coast at Brandy Bay and Worbarrow Bay. It is part of the Lulworth Range Walks in the Purbeck Hills near Kimmeridge Bay. The range walks are open most weekends but check the website below for more details. The walk starts from the car park in Tyneham Village with its interesting ruined buildings. You then head to the South West Coast Path where there are lovely views along the coast to Brandy Bay, Horbarrow Bay and Kimmeridge Bay. The route continues west along the coast to Worbarrow Tout and the beautiful Worbarrow Bay. A climb to the Iron Age Hill Fort at Flower Barrow is quite challenging but you are rewarded with more magnificent coastal views. The route continues to Whiteway Hill before descending back into Tyneham. The area is owned by the military and while this restricts access it does encourage a wide variety of interesting flora and fauna. Look out for rare flowers, fungi and insects as you make your way through this lovely area. The walk can easily be extended by heading east to the nearby Povington Hill (191 m) and the range's highest point, Ridgeway Hill (199 m). Here you will find the pretty Stonehill Downs Nature Reserve where there is a variety of birdlife to look out for.",

The 17th century inn has a very good menu and a lovely large garden area for warmer days. You can find them at postcode BH20 5QQ for your sat navs."

      "content": "For an alternative route see the Tyneham Walk which starts from the same car park. This route explores the area east of the village, climbing to the viewpoints at Povington Hill and Tyneham Cap. Head a few miles to the west and you could visit the historic Lulworth Castle. The castle dates back to the 17th Century and includes some beautiful grounds and gardens. Near here there's the Winfrith Newburgh Heath and Tadnoll Nature Reserves. The reserves include miles of peaceful heathland trails with lots of wildlife and a splendid viewpoint. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dorset Walks page."
