  "description": "This lovely circular walk takes you from Southwold to the small neighbouring village of Covehithe. The walks starts at Southwold Pier with the first section running north along the foreshore to Covehithe. On the way you will pass the picturesque Covehithe broad and pay a visit to the ruins of the old Saint Andrews Church. The return leg then picks up a section of the Suffolk Coast Path and follows the waymarked trail south through the countryside to return to Southwold. This part of the walk runs through the Pottersbridge Marshes and neighbouring Reydon. Here you can look out for a variety of birdlife around the marshes and watercourses. The route runs for about 8.5 miles on fairly flat paths so should suit most abilities. You can extend the walk by continuing north to visit the pretty Benacre Broad.",
