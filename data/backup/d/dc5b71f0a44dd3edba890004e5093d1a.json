  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside walk along Howden Reservoir before a climb to Margery Hill provides great views over the area. The 11 mile circular walk includes a moderate climb so a reasonable level of fitness is required. The walk starts at the Fairholmes car park, at the southern end of Derwent Reservoir. There are good facilities here with an excellent visitor centre and cafe. From here you can pick up trails heading north along the eastern side of Derwent Reservoir, passing the noteworthy Derwent Dam before eventually leading you to Howden Dam and Howden Reservoir. The reservoir is in an interesting position with the western half lieing in Derbyshire, whereas the eastern half is in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The county border runs through the middle of the reservoir, following the original path of the River Derwent. Trails continue north along the eastern side of the water until you reach the end of the reservoir. Here you turn east to pick up footpaths climbing to Cranberry Clough and Howden Edge, before the final ascent to Margery Hill. The hill stands at a height of 546-metrea (1,791 ft) making it one of the high points on the Howden Moors. The area is managed by the National Trust as part of their High Peak Estate and has also been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument by English Heritage. There are nice views of the surrounding Peak District Hills and the Ewden valley below. After taking in the views the route then descends back to Howden Edge before heading south to Wilfrey Neild, Upper Ney and Howden Clough. A short woodland section through Clough Wood then leads you back down to the reservoir where you can follow the waterside paths back to the car park. To continue your walking in the area head south and visit the lovely Ladybower Reservoir .",
