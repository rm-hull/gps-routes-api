  "description": "Enjoy a short walk through the delightful grounds of Sizergh Castle in the Lake District. There are 1,600-acres to explore including limestone pasture, orchards and semi-natural woodland. The beautiful gardens contain a pond, a lake, and a limestone rock garden. There are also fabulous views of the Yorkshire Dales and the Lake District. The site is run by the National Trust so there are excellent facilities with a cafe, shop and guided tours around the interesting medieval Sizergh Castle. There is also an ancient Yew Tree reckoned to be 1,600 years old - ask at reception for details. The walk route below takes you around the castle grounds and through Low Wood to the River Kent before returning to the start point at the castle. There's also the option of climbing to the fine viewpoint at Sizergh Fell or enjoying a walk through Brigsteer Woods to the west. Sizergh is located about 3 miles south of Kendal. One option is to follow the River Kent from Kendal to the castle which is not far from the river. You could also visit from Oxenholme train station. You can follow footpaths through Natland and the surrounding countryside to the site. If you have time you could visit the nearby Levens Hall. Here you will find a deer park and a stunning topiary garden with over 100 pieces of living sculpture. If you continue north through Brigsteer Woods you will soon come to Helsington Barrows and Scout Scar. It's a great viewpoint above Kendal with fabulous views of most of the major fells. Also of interest is Kendal's ruined 12th century castle which you can visit on our Kendal Castle and River Walk .",

The historic inn dates back to the 1880s with a babbling brook running beneath it. There's a fine interior with log fires, cosy corners and a lovely sunny conservatory. Outside there's a nice garden area for warmer weather. They serve an excellent Sunday roast and also provide quality rooms if you'd like to stay in the area. You can find them at postcode LA8 8AN for your sat navs."

      "content": "For some nice views over Kendal and the surrounding fells you could head east of the town centre to visit Hay Fell and it's peak of Benson Knott. The walk includes a stroll along the River Mint before climbing to the 319m / 1047ft summit. The circular Brigsteer Woods Walk starts from the village of Brigsteer to the north west. The route additionally visits the 18th century Helsington Church where there is an excellent viewpoint with views over the Lyth Valley. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lake District Walks page."
