  "description": "Enjoy a short walk through the delightful grounds of Sizergh Castle in the Lake District.  There are 1,600-acres to explore including limestone pasture, orchards and semi-natural woodland.  The beautiful gardens contain a pond, a lake, and a limestone rock garden. There are also fabulous views of the Yorkshire Dales and the Lake District. The site is run by the National Trust so there are excellent facilities with a cafe, shop and guided tours around the interesting medieval Sizergh Castle. There is also an ancient Yew Tree reckoned to be 1,600 years old - ask at reception for details. The walk route below takes you around the castle grounds and through Low Wood to the River Kent before returning to the start point at the castle. There's also the option of climbing to the fine viewpoint at Sizergh Fell or enjoying a walk through Brigsteer Woods to the west. Sizergh is located about 3 miles south of Kendal. One option is to follow the River Kent from Kendal to the castle which is not far from the river. You could also visit from Oxenholme train station. You can follow footpaths through Natland and the surrounding countryside to the site. If you have time you could visit the nearby Levens Hall . Here you will find a deer park and a stunning topiary garden with over 100 pieces of living sculpture. If you continue north through Brigsteer Woods you will soon come to Helsington Barrows and Scout Scar . It's a great viewpoint above Kendal with fabulous views of most of the major fells. Also of interest is Kendal's ruined 12th century castle which you can visit on our Kendal Castle and River Walk .",
