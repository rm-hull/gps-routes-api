  "description": "A splendid circular walk around Chepstow making use of the Wye Valley Walk and Offa's Dyke Path to visit some of the highlights of the area. There's lovely views of the River Wye, lots of peaceful woodland trails and a visit to the historic Tintern Abbey as you pass from Wales into England. The walk starts at Chepstow Castle, the oldest surviving post-Roman stone fortification in Britain. From here you can pick up the Wye Valley Walk and follow it past the town before picking up woodland trails through Alcove Wood and Pierce Wood. You then pass Piercefield Park and Piercefield House, a largely ruined neo-classical country house dating from the late 18th century. You continue past Chepstow Race Course, before climbing to the Eagle's Nest viewpoint on 365 steps trail. Here you will stand high above the Wye at Wyndcliff, looking out over the sweeping curve of the river around the Lancaut Peninsula. The route then descends through Wyndcliff Wood and Black Cliff Wood before coming to Tintern Abbey. Here you can explore the fascinating ruins of a 12th century monastery. It's a beautiful area with the atmospheric ruins and the river flanked by the attractive woodland of the Forest of Dean. After passing the abbey you cross the river on the old Tintern Railway Bridge which carried the Tintern Wireworks Branch trains over the river until 1935. Heading south the next section picks up the Offa's Dyke Path and climbs to the viewpoint at the Devil's Pulpit. From here there are more wonderful views over the abbey and the AONB. The route then continues to Plumweir Cliff and Worgan Wood before coming to the village of Woodcroft. Here you will pass Wintour's Leap where there are some magnificent limestone cliffs and Peregrine Falcons to look out for. The final section takes you from Woodcroft back into Chepstow, crossing the river before returning to the castle.",

      "content": "A few miles to the north east you could visit the interesting village of St Briavels. Here you will find the historic St Briavels Castle which dates back to the 12th century and is open to the public under the care of English Heritage. The village can be accessed by crossing the Bigsweir Bridge over the Wye from Llandogo in Wales to St Briavels in England on the other side. In Llandogo you can enjoy a walk to the pretty Cleddon Falls on the River Cleddon. Near here there's Brockweir where there is easy access to the historic ruins of Tintern Abbey and Tintern Old Station, where you can learn all about the history of the local railway. For more walking ideas in the area see the Forest of Dean Walks page."
