  "description": "This circular walk from the town of Porlock uses sections of the South West Coast Path and the Coleridge Way to take you on a tour of the coast and woods surrounding the town. The walk starts in Porock and follows the South West Coast Path east to Bossington before turning west along Porlock Bay to the pretty village of Porlock Weir. It's a very popular area with a lovely harbour and lots of attractive little cottages, many of which date from the\u00a017th century. After exploring the village the walk returns to Porlock via woodland trails around West Porlock. To extend your walking in the area you can continue along coast path west to England's smallest church in Culbone and onto Foreland Point. The little church is a Grade I listed building, dating from pre Norman times. It's only a short woodland walk from the Porlock Weir car park so well worth a visit. You can also follow the Coleridge Way south into Exmoor and visit Dunkery Beacon - the highest point in\u00a0Exmoor\u00a0and Somerset. Also nearby is the splendid Holnicote Estate where you can climb Selworthy Beacon and Bossington Hill for more great views. Just to the west you can explore the beautiful Doone Valley. Here you can try our lovely Lorna Doone Walk which visits some of the sites connected to Richard Dodderidge Blackmore's 1869 novel 'Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor'.",
