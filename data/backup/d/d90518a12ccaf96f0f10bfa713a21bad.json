  "description": "Burton Upon Stather is a North Lincolnshire based village located near Scunthorpe on the eastern side of the River Trent. Local highlights include the Grade I listed church which dates to the 12th century. To the south east there's Normanby Hall Country Park where you can enjoy miles of trails around the parkland and woodland surrounding the 19th century hall. This walk from the village takes you north along a section of the Nev Cole Way to the neighbouring village of Alkborough. Here you can explore the Alkborough Flats Nature Reserve and visit Trent Falls - the point where the Rivers Ouse, Humber and Trent all meet. The area is great for birdwatching and peaceful nature walks. Starting in the village you head north to pick up The Cliff bridleway which runs just to the east of the River Trent. There are some nice views over the river from this elevated woodland path. It will lead you to Alkborough village where there's the interesting Julian's Bower - one of the last surviving medieval turf mazes in Britain. The maze is in a fine location overlooking the Humber Estuary. You then come to the Alkborough Flats Nature Reserve where can enjoy views of the confluence of the three major rivers at Trent Falls. It's an interesting area with the RSPB's Blacktoft Sands Nature Reserve on the opposite side. Here you can look out for a variety of wildlife including marsh harrier, bittern, kestrels, avocets and bearded tit. The route then heads east along the River Humber Bank before finishing in the riverside village of Whitton.",
