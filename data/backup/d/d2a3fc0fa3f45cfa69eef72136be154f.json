  "description": "Climb to the 714 metres (2,343\u00a0ft) summit of Hedgehope Hill in the Cheviots on this challenging circular walk. The walk begins at the parking area at Langleeford by the Harthope Burn. You then ascend towards Housey Crags and Long Crags and onto the summit where there are fabulous views towards the coast and Lindisfarne Castle. You can descend the same way or head towards Harthope Linn waterfall where you can follow the Harthope Burn back to Langleeford. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb the The Cheviot and Windy Gyle or pick up the Pennine Way . The hill is located just to the south of the popular town of Wooler, which is a great base for walkers. Here you can visit the woodland of Wooler Common and enjoy a climb Humbleton Hill with its Iron Age Hillfort.",
