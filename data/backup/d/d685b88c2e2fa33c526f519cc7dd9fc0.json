      "caption": "Langley Castle\u00a0is a restored medieval tower house, now operated as an hotel, situated in the village of Langley in the valley of the South Tyne some three miles south of Haydon Bridge, Northumberland. The castle has an interesting history having been attacked and severely damaged in 1405 by the forces of\u00a0Henry IV\u00a0in the campaign against the\u00a0Percys\u00a0and\u00a0Archbishop Scrope. It remained as a ruin until it was bought and restored by a local historian,\u00a0Cadwallader Bates, in 1882."

  "description": "This Northumberland based village has some nice river and country trails to try. There's some fine walks through the landscape of the North Pennines AONB, waymarked trails along the River South Tyne and the epic Hadrian's Wall Path to explore to the north. This walk from the village takes you south to visit neighbouring Langley. The walk starts on the River South Tyne in the village centre, near to the train station. You can follow a nice country lane south west to Robbs Dene before crossing the Deanraw Burn near East Deanraw. You then continue south to Langley where you can enjoy views of the Langley Dam and Langley Castle. The castle is Grade I listed and dates back to the 14th century. Today it is a luxury hotel \u00a0set in a woodland estate of 10 acres.",
