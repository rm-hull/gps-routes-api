      "caption": "Langley Castle is a restored medieval tower house, now operated as an hotel, situated in the village of Langley in the valley of the South Tyne some three miles south of Haydon Bridge, Northumberland. The castle has an interesting history having been attacked and severely damaged in 1405 by the forces of Henry IV in the campaign against the Percys and Archbishop Scrope. It remained as a ruin until it was bought and restored by a local historian, Cadwallader Bates, in 1882."

  "description": "This Northumberland based village has some nice river and country trails to try. There's some fine walks through the landscape of the North Pennines AONB, waymarked trails along the River South Tyne and the epic Hadrian's Wall Path to explore to the north. This walk from the village takes you south to visit neighbouring Langley. The walk starts on the River South Tyne in the village centre, near to the train station. You can follow a nice country lane south west to Robbs Dene before crossing the Deanraw Burn near East Deanraw. You then continue south to Langley where you can enjoy views of the Langley Dam and Langley Castle. The castle is Grade I listed and dates back to the 14th century. Today it is a luxury hotel set in a woodland estate of 10 acres.",

The historic 17th century inn is located in a lovely spot next to the river and the bridge which dates back to the 14th century. If the weather is good you can sit outside in the garden area and enjoy views over the water. You can find them at postcode NE47 6AB for your sat navs. You could also stop off at Langley Castle and enjoy afternoon tea beneath the shimmering drawing room chandeliers."

      "content": "Just to the west of the village there's one of the highlights of the area at the National Trust's Allen Banks and Staward Gorge near Bardon Mill. There's lovely trails to follow through the wooded gorge to Plankey Mill. The village is also located just a few miles of Housesteads Roman Fort. Here you can explore the fascinating old fort and pick up the epic Hadrian's Wall Path. Head south of the site and you can visit the village of Allendale. The stone built village is very pretty and was twice crowned Village of the Year for All England. There are some nice walks here along the River East Allen. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northumberland Walks and North Pennines Walks pages."
