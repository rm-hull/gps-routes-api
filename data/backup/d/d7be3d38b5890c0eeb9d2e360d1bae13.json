  "description": "This pretty reservoir is located in the village of Harthill in South Yorkshire. It has a nice surfaced footpath running alongside the water and through a small woodland section on the western side. The walk can be extended by heading south to the nearby Pebley Reservoir. Just to the north you can pick up the Cuckoo Way along the Chester Canal and enjoy more waterside walking. You could pick up the towpath around Kiveton and follow it east toward Shireoaks. The canal can be followed into the city of Chester via the historic village of Christleton .",

The pub still retains its country feel, mixed with a modern and friendly atmosphere. There's a good menu and a nice outdoor seating with country views, where you can relax in the summer months. You can find the pub in the village at 16 Union Street with a postcode of S267YH for your sat navs."
