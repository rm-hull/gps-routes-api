  "description": "This route takes you along a section of the West Highland Way from Drymen to Balmaha. The walk runs for just under 8 miles following the waymarked trail west through Gardhban Forest in the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park. You then have the option of descending to Balmaha via Milton of Buchanan or ascending to the viewpoint at Conic Hill. The route shown on the maps below takes the latter of these two options. The finish point is Balmaha on the shores of Loch Lomond. Here you can enjoy a boat trip to the tranquil Inchcailloch Island or explore the Balmaha Forest on a number of woodland trails. To continue your walking along the trail pick up the next leg on the Balmaha to Milarrochy Bay and Rowardennan Walk. The preceding section is the Milngavie to Drymen Walk which takes you to the trail head at Milngavie.",
