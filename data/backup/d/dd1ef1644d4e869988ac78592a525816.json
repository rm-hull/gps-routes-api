  "description": "A short walk along a delightful stretch of the Pembrokeshire Coast. The route takes you between the lovely villages of Amroth and Saundersfoot, with pretty beaches, cliff tops and coastal views. The walk is about 2.5 miles with a moderate climb at the start before a nice flat path leads you into Saundersfoot. Along the way you'll pass the long sandy beach in Amroth and the rocky beach at Wiseman's Bridge. In Saundersfoot the walk finishes, passing another nice beach and the lovely harbour. To extend your walking in Amroth you can visit Amroth and Colby Woodland Garden, just to the north of the village. The National Trust owned property has some good woodland trails to try. You could also continue on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to nearby Tenby. On the google street view link below you can virtually explore the coast path!",
