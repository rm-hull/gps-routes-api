  "description": "This modern Oxfordshire based town is located in the western part of the county near Witney. This walk from the town takes you through the Willow Meadows to the neighbouring village of Alvescot. The meadows lie on the western side of the town and have some nice footpaths heading south along the Shill Brook. You'll also pass RAF Brize Norton, the largest station of the Royal Air Force. To continue your walking around Carterton head south to visit the nearby village of Bampton. Here you can pick up the Thames Path and enjoy a waterside walk along the River Thames.",
