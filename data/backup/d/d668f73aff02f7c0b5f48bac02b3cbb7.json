  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Loch Achray in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. You can park at the Ben Venue Car Park at the western end of the loch. The good sized car park is close to the loch where you can walk along the road and shoreline. The Ben A'an Car Park is just around the corner if you prefer to visit the loch from there. There's plenty of trails branching off from the loch into the wider woodland of the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park. The loch is nicely positioned close to other bodies of water including Glen Finglas Reservoir, Loch Katrine, Loch Venachar and Loch Drunkie. On the northern side of the Loch you will also find the picturesque Trossachs Church which dates to 1849.",
