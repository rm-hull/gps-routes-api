  "description": "The Wiltshire based town of Warminster is in an ideal location for exploring the lovely Cranborne Chase AONB and the expansive Salisbury Plain. There's also two popular long distance trails to pick up and two interesting hill forts to visit. This short circular walk around the town takes you around the Smallbrook Meadows Nature Reserve and the Lake Pleasure Grounds in the town centre. It's a delightful area with riverside paths along the River Were and the River Wylye. There's also six small water meadows, wet woodland, marsh, ponds, chalk rivers, hedgerows and ditches. Look out for wildlife including kingfishers and water voles. To continue your walking around the town head west and enjoy a climb to Cley Hill. There's fine views over the town and surrounding countryside from here. The delightful Heaven's Gate at Longleat and the pretty Shearwater Lake also provide more fine walking opportunities near the town.",
