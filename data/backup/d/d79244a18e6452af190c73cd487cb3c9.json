  "description": "The Wiltshire based town of Warminster is in an ideal location for exploring the lovely Cranborne Chase AONB and the expansive Salisbury Plain. There's also two popular long distance trails to pick up and two interesting hill forts to visit. This short circular walk around the town takes you around the Smallbrook Meadows Nature Reserve and the Lake Pleasure Grounds in the town centre. It's a delightful area with riverside paths along the River Were and the River Wylye. There's also six small water meadows, wet woodland, marsh, ponds, chalk rivers, hedgerows and ditches. Look out for wildlife including kingfishers and water voles. To continue your walking around the town head west and enjoy a climb to Cley Hill. There's fine views over the town and surrounding countryside from here. The delightful Heaven's Gate at Longleat and the pretty Shearwater Lake also provide more fine walking opportunities near the town.",

      "content": "The Mere Walk starts from the attractive nearby town and climbs to White Sheet Hill. The hill is part of the splendid Stourhead and includes an Iron Age Hillfort, an aerial transmitter and a small reservoir. There's also some lovely downland and excellent views over the area. The town itself is also worth visiting with a photogenic market square, the excellent viewpoint at Long Hill and a fine 16th century coaching inn for refreshment afterwards. For more walking ideas in the area see the Wiltshire Walks and the Cranborne Chase Walks pages."
