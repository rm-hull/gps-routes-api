  "description": "This short climb takes you to High Tor hill between Matlock and Matlock Bath. The impressive limestone crag is just over a mile from the town centre and the train station. If you follow the Derwent Valley Heritage Way along the River Derwent south you will soon come to the tor. There's fantastic views of Matlock Bath, the Heights of Abraham, Riber Castle and the surrounding Peak District countryside from the summit. The hill also includes a splendid narrow walkway called 'Giddy Ledge'. Only try this if you've a real head for heights though! You can extend your walk by descending into Matlock Bath through the river gorge. Here you can visit the fantastic Heights of Abraham where you can enjoy a cable car ride to a hill top park. You can turn it into a circular walk by crossing the river in Matlock Bath and returning via the Height of Abraham and Shining Cliff. See the video below for more details of this route. Just to the south of the hill there's some nice riverside trails on the Lovers Walk. The Limestone Way also runs through Matlock so you could pick this up and head towards the village of Bonsall through the countryside.",

The traditional British village pub has a cosy interior with log burners, low beams and stone walls. Outside there's a garden area where you can enjoy views of The Derwent Valley World Heritage Site. They serve good quality traditional dishes including a fine Sunday roast. You can find the pub at 195 Starkholmes Rd, Starkholmes, DE4 5JA. The pub is dog friendly."
