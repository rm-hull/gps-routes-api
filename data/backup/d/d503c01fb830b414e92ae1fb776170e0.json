  "description": "This walk visits the historic Belvedere House and Lough Ennell in Mullingar,\u00a0County Westmeath. Belvedere House is a splendid\u00a0Georgian House and Estate\u00a0located next to the beautiful large lake. It's a lovely place for a stroll with lakeshore walks, woodland trails and a Victorian Walled Garden to explore. There's also the fine architecture of the 18th century house and some highly photogenic ruined follies to admire here. In particular look out for 'The Jealous Wall' created as a result of a quarrel between Robert Rochfort and his brother George, the owner of nearby Rochfort House. In the expansive woodland look out for some fine Specimen trees, statues and lots of wildlife. The walled garden contains a wide range of flowers and an arboretum. There's also a delightful fairy garden with little streams, bridges and sprites fluttering in the wind.",
