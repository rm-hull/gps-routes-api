The main river flowing into Lough Ennell is the River Brosna, which enters on the Mullingar side of the lake and exits on the opposite side at Lilliput. Lilliput and Lilliput House were frequently used by Jonathan Swift as a holiday home and place to write, local tradition states that Jonathan Swift was in a boat on the lake when he looked back at Lilliput and noticed how small the people looked at that distance, hence the inspiration for his most famous book Gulliver's Travels"

  "description": "This walk visits the historic Belvedere House and Lough Ennell in Mullingar, County Westmeath. Belvedere House is a splendid Georgian House and Estate located next to the beautiful large lake. It's a lovely place for a stroll with lakeshore walks, woodland trails and a Victorian Walled Garden to explore. There's also the fine architecture of the 18th century house and some highly photogenic ruined follies to admire here. In particular look out for 'The Jealous Wall' created as a result of a quarrel between Robert Rochfort and his brother George, the owner of nearby Rochfort House. In the expansive woodland look out for some fine Specimen trees, statues and lots of wildlife. The walled garden contains a wide range of flowers and an arboretum. There's also a delightful fairy garden with little streams, bridges and sprites fluttering in the wind.",
