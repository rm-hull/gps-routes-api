  "description": "This shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line in Sandbach. The easy trail is a popular one with people looking for an easy stroll or ride in the area. After the line closed in 1966 it became overgrown but in 2000 work started to transform the line for public access. It's now a pleasant tree lined path with lots of interesting flora to look out for in the spring and summer months. The route runs for just over a mile along a flat surfaced path just to the south of the town. You can pick up the trail next to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Malkin's Bank. Then head north west through Wheelock village to Elworth where the trail finishes.",

      "content": "You can continue your exercise on the Trent and Mersey Canal. Head east and you can visit one of the highlights of the area at Rode Hall. The Georgian country house is surrounded by lovely parkland with woodland, gardens and a large lake. Just to the east of the eastern end of the trail you'll find a similar route on the Salt Line. This easy path will take you from Hassall Green to Alsager, passing the pretty Borrow Pit Meadows nature reserve on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
