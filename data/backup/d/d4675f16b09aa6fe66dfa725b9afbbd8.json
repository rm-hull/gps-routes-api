  "description": "This village in Leicestershire is located in the National Forest area of the country. There's canalside paths, river trails, country parks and several nearby reservoirs to visit in the surrounding area. Rothley is one of Leicestershire's most affluent areas based on number of houses worth more than \u00a31 million. This walk takes you along the nearby Grand Union Canal Walk to visit Watermead Country Park. The walk starts at Rothley Park on the western side of the village. You then head east past the Town Green, crossing the Rothley Brook as you go. At the eastern side of the village you will come to Cossington Old Mill next to the River Soar and the canal. Here you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it south to visit Watermead Country Park. There's a number of lovely lakeside and riverside trails to follow around the park.",
