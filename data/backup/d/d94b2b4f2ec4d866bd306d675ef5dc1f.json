  "description": "This circular walk takes you on a tour of the beautiful Forest of Arden in Warwickshire. The route starts and ends near Henley in Arden railway, first taking you to Ulenhall before heading towards Studley where you will pass the impressive 19th century Studley Castle which is now a luxury hotel. You then join the River Arrow leading you to Coughton. Here you will find the 16th century Tudor house Coughton Court which has a place in English history for its role in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 as some of the conspirators rode directly back there after it failed. From Coughton you head to the attractive market town of Alcester, then through Oversley Wood to Exhall where you turn north. The walk then passes Spernall Park and Bannan's wood before returning to Henley-in-Arden.",
