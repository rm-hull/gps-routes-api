  "description": "Harlow is located in West Essex in a nice spot in the River Stort Valley. There's good waterside footpaths, a local wood/nature reserve and several waymarked walking trails running through the town. This canal and river walk walk takes you to neighbouring Sawbridgeworth along a section of the River Stort Navigation which runs along the northern fringes of the town. It also visits the nearby Pishiobury Park where there are some easy surfaced trails to try. On the way there's a number of picturesque locks and nice country views. The walk starts from Harlow Town rail station where you can directly pick up the Stort Valley Way . Follow the waymarked trail east and it will take you past Gilston, Latton Lock, Hollingson Meads and Feakes Lock before coming to Sawbridgeworth. The route then leaves the river to follow trails through Nursery Wood and Pishiobury Park. This pleasant park on the outskirts of Sawbridgeworth includes wet woodland (The Osier Bed), grazed fields and flood meadows. It's a nice place for a short circular walk before returning to the river and following the waterside path back to the train station in Harlow.",
