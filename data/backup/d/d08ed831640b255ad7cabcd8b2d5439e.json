  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this spectacularly positioned ruined castle in Carmarthenshire. The castle sits on an elevated limestone precipice with fabulous views over the lovely Brecon Beacons countryside. There are a series of good footpaths taking you around the grounds and an invigorating climb up to the castle itself. The castle includes a natural cave which leads deep into the hillside, six towers, a great twin-towered gatehouse and the fascinating King's Chamber dating from the 13th/14th century. The Brecon Beacons Way also runs past the castle so you can pick this up to continue your walking in the area. Carreg Cennen Castle is located about four miles south of Llandeilo on the western tip of the Brecon Beacons National Park. To continue your walking in the area head to Llandeilo and visit Dinefwr Park. Here you'll find a 12th-century castle, a historic house, an 18th-century landscaped park and a medieval deer park. Our circular walk from Llandeilo visits the castle and the ancient woodland at the Tregeyb Wood nature reserve. Near here there's also Gelli Aur Country Park. The park surrounds the Golden Grove mansion and includes a deer park, peacocks, views of the Tywi Valley and an aboretum with some fine specimen trees.",
