  "description": "Enjoy waterside cycling and walking in this splendid country park in Redditch. The park includes the large Arrow Valley Lake and the River Arrow with walking and cycling trails running alongside both. With 900 acres to explore on four waymarked trails there is plenty to see and do in the park. The Miller's trail runs up to Forge Mill Needle Museum in the north end of the park, and there is a Woodland Trail going to the south end of the park. There's also an excellent visitor centre and cafe with panoramic views across Arrow Valley Lake. National Cycle Network Route number 5 also runs through the park so you could continue your ride towards Stratford-Upon-Avon. You could reach the park by following the Miller's Trail from the 12th century Bordesley Abbey on our Redditch Walk .",
