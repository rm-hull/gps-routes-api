  "description": "This little Herefordshire village is located on the eastern side of the Brecon Beacons, in the Black Mountains region. It's a nice place to start a walk with some significant hills to climb to the west. The village itself is also very pretty with a little brook running through it and a fine local pub for refreshments after your exercise. This walk from the village climbs to the nearby Cat's Back, a wonderful ridge on the England - Wales border. The route starts in the village and heads west along country lanes to the Black Hill car park. There's an information board here telling you all about the area. From here you can pick up a trail up to the Cat's Back and follow the ridge up to the Black Hill Summit where there are magnificent views over the Olchon Valley to the Brecon Beacons. After taking in the views the route descends back to the car park before following alternative paths through the countryside to the west of the village.",

You can sit outside in the pretty garden and enjoy your meal with views of the stream. They have a varied menu and a particularly good selection of ciders as well. You can find them about 2 miles east of the car park at postcode HR2 0JW for your sat navs."
