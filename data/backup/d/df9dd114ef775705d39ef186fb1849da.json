  "description": "This short climb follows the Offa's Dyke Path from the Clywd Forest to Moel Arthur in the Clwydian Range AONB. You can start the walk from the car park at the eastern end of the Clywd Forest, about a mile north west of Moel Arthur. You then follow good footpaths to the summit where there are lovely views over the Vale of Clywd and the other mountains on the Clwydian Range. In the autumn months the hill slopes are a lovely site, covered in pretty heather. The area also has an interesting history with an Iron Age Hillfort and some of the largest banks and ditches in the area. If you would like to extend your walking in the area then you could continue south along the Offa's Dyke Path to the nearby Moel Famau Country Park . Here you can climb the 1818ft high Moel Famau for wonderful views of the Wirral, Merseyside, Snowdonia, the Dee Valley and the coast.",
