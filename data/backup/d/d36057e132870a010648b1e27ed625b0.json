  "description": "Enjoy a waterside cycle or walk along the magnificent Loch Lochy on this route in the Scottish Highlands. On the northern/western side of the loch there is an excellent traffic free cycle and walking trail running along the Great Glen Way . You can park at the little Hamlet of Clunes and then pick up the waterside trail. The trail runs through the woodland of Clunes Forest with the option of extending your walk in the woods. To extend your exercise you could continue north east along the Great Glen Way and visit Loch Oich , Loch Garry and the Caledonian Canal . At Loch Oich you'll find a great circular cycling and walking trail which explores the woods above the loch. You could also climb to the munros which rise above the loch. Sron a Choire Ghairbh and Meall na Teanga are just to the west of the path and provide wonderful views over the area. Just a mile to the west of the car park at the start of this route you will find the more peaceful Loch Arkaig with its lovely pine forest.",
