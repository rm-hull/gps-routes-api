  "description": "Follow the circular cycling and walking trail around the beautiful Usk Reservoir on this route in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The route begins at the car park next to the dam at the eastern end of the reservoir. It follows good compacted-stone forestry tracks and tarmac roads alongside the waters edge and through the surrounding woodland of the Glasfynydd Forest. There are also splendid views of the surrounding countryside and mountains. Look out for wildlife around the reservoir including Red Kites.",

      "content": "If you head a few miles north west of the reservoir you can visit the market town of Llandovery. There's good facilities here with a train station, pubs and cafes. There's also the ruined 13th century castle and some nice trails along the River Towy to try. Head a few miles south and you will come to two other significant bodies of water in the Beacons. Llyn y Fan Fach are Llyn Y Fan Fawr in a wonderfully isolated spot. There's a popualr trail running to the lakes with climbs to the surrounding mountains for the more adventurous. A few miles to the north east you can pick up the Epynt Way. This shared cycling and walking trail takes you around Mynydd Epynt in the MOD's Sennybridge Army Training Area. To the east is the village of Trecastle where you can pick up the trail up to Trecastle Mountain which lies just to the north of the lake. There is an interesting Roman site and an ancient stone circle to see here."
