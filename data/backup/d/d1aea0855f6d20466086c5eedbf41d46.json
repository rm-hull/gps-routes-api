  "description": "This circular walk explores Hembury Castle Hill Fort and Hembury Woods in Buckfastleigh, Devon. There's miles of shady trails with waterside paths along the Holy Brook and the River Dart, which runs through the eastern side of the wood. There's parking areas along the country lane which runs through the woods, including one just to the west of Hembury Castle. From here you can pick up paths leading up to the Iron Age Hillfort before descending into the surrounding woodland. Head east and you can pick up a nice trail running along the River Dart, before heading along the Holy Brook to return to the car park. The site is located on the edge of the Dartmoor National Park with the Dartmoor Way passing along the southern edge of the woods. If you prefer you could start the walk from Buckfasltleigh and follow the trail to the site. To extend your exercise follow the waymarked path north west to go deeper into the National Park. Just to the north of the woods you will find River Dart Country Park where there's 90 acres, of lakes, parkland, woodland trails and another nice waterside footpath along the River Dart. Just to the south east is the delightful Buckfast Abbey where there's a series of well laid paths through lovely gardens surrounding the abbey. Venford Reservoir is also nearby. It has a nice easy trail to follow around the water.",
