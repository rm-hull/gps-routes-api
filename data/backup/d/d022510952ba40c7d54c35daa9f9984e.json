  "description": "This riverside village is located just south of Lake Windermere in the Lake District National Park. It's a lovely place for a stroll with fine views of the River Leven and the surrounding hills from the village. This walk from Backbarrow takes you south along the river to visit the old Ironworks and the neighbouring village of Haverthwaite . The Ironworks date back to 1711 and are thought to be the best preserved of their type in the country. You can enjoy explore the historic site and see the remains of the 1770 furnace stack; the waterwheel pit and later power house; the ovens that re-heated waste gases to supply a hot blast to the furnace; and the massive stone barns that stored the iron-making ingredients. At the start of the route there's also the popular Lakeland Motor Museum . Here you can view a wonderful collection of over 30,000 exhibits that trace the development of road transport throughout the twentieth century. These include cycles, motorbikes, motor cars and automobilia. In Haverthwaite there's the heritage Lakeside & Haverthwaite Railway from Haverthwaite Station. You can catch a boat from Bowness to the Lakeside station on Windermere and then get on the popular tourist train to the village. It's a nice way to visit the lake from the area.",
