  "description": "This pretty little Warwickshire village is located in a lovely spot on the edge of the Cotswolds. The major settlements of Banbury and Warwick are also close by. This circular walk from the village visits two of the highlights of the area at Burton Dassett Hills Country Park and the National Trust's Farnborough Hall. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Warwickshire Centenary Way and follow the waymarked footpath north to Bitham Hill and Burton Dassett Hills. There's fantastic views over the surrounding area from this elevated park. After exploring the park you can pick up a country lane and follow it south east to visit the neighbouring village of Farnborough where you'll find the historic Farnborough Hall. The Grade I listed hall dates from the 18th century and is surrounded by attractive parkland and gardens. From here you can pick up a country lane heading west past the pretty Stourland Pool to return to the village.",
