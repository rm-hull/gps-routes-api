  "description": "This pretty little Warwickshire village is located in a lovely spot on the edge of the Cotswolds. The major settlements of Banbury and Warwick are also close by. This circular walk from the village visits two of the highlights of the area at Burton Dassett Hills Country Park and the National Trust's Farnborough Hall. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Warwickshire Centenary Way and follow the waymarked footpath north to Bitham Hill and Burton Dassett Hills. There's fantastic views over the surrounding area from this elevated park. After exploring the park you can pick up a country lane and follow it south east to visit the neighbouring village of Farnborough where you'll find the historic Farnborough Hall. The Grade I listed hall dates from the 18th century and is surrounded by attractive parkland and gardens. From here you can pick up a country lane heading west past the pretty Stourland Pool to return to the village.",

Here you'll find some fine views and the site of the Battle of Edgehill, the first battle of the English Civil War fought in 1642. The area includes an excellent, elevated pub where you can enjoy views over the battlefield. Just to the east you could enjoy some waterside walking along the Oxford Canal Walk or around the pretty Clattercote Reservoir. Follow the Warwickshire Centenary Way south west and you will soon come to neighbouring Tysoe where you could enjoy a climb to the Tysoe Windmill. The photogenic old mill sits on top of a 184 metre hill with excellent views over the Cotswolds. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks and the Cotswolds Walks pages."
