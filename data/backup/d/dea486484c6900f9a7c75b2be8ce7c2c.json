  "description": "This Lincolnshire based market town is located on the River Welland in the South Kesteven district of the county, a few miles north of the city of Peterborough. It's an historic place with several 17th century stone buildings, a weekly market dating back to 1220 and a well known stone bridge from the mid 17th century. This walk in the town takes you along the riverside public footpaths heading south east towards Deeping St James and Peakirk. The walk can be started on Market Deeping Bridge in the town. Then follow the tree lined footpath east with some lovely views along the peaceful river. The route continues towards Peakirk where you will find the Deeping Lakes Nature Reserve. The Reserve is run by Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust and is a great place for spotting water loving birds and other wildlife in the area. For an alternative walk from Market Deeping head north west to the Tallington Lakes Leisure Park. There are some public footpaths here with views over the pretty lakes.",

For a pub lunch there's The Bull, a coaching inn dating back to the 16th century. It has a lovely olde worlde feel featuring oak beams, flagstones and exposed stone walls. You can find them on the Market Square at postcode PE6 8EA for your sat navs. They are dog friendly outside."
