The mill as one might expect was used to grind corn in flour but was finally used to produce animal feed. When it ground to a halt in 1956 and was the last working tide-mill. To the left you will see the granary where the wheat was stored. The tide mill was restored and opened to the public in 1972. The pond in which tide water was trapped to run the mill became the Yacht Harbour a small pond still exists for demonstration of the mill."

  "description": "This pretty little village is located in a lovely spot next to the River Deben in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It also includes a splendid riverside pub and a noteworthy 14th century church which is Grade II listed. This walk from the village takes you north along the River Deben to the neighbouring settlements of Martlesham and Woodbridge. The route runs for about 5 miles on flat paths so is suitable for most abilities. On the way there's lovely riverside trails and fine views across the Suffolk countryside to enjoy. Start the walk in the village where you can pick up a riverside path and follow it north before heading west along a country lane. You continue north west along the Waldringfield Road to Martlesham Creek which is a great spot for birdwatching. Here you pick up the Fynn Valley Walk and follow the waymarked path along the creek before rejoining the river. There's a lovely waterside stretch along the river in Woodbridge where the walk finishes at the pretty quay.",
