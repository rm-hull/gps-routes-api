At Jumbles Reservoir in Jumbles Country Park you will turn north passing Entwistle Reservoir and Wayoh Reservoir before climbing Darwen Hill where you will find Jubilee Tower. You can climb the 85 ft high tower for some splendid views of North Yorkshire, Morecambe Bay, Blackpool Tower, Cumbria, and the Isle of Man. This section also passes the pretty Roddlesworth Reservoir, Abbey Village Reservoir and Rake Brook Reservoir which are surrounded by nice woodland trails. The route finishes passing the town of Darwen and then descending into Witton Country Park .",

At the back of the pub there\u2019s a sun-trap beer garden and part-covered courtyard. It's an ideal place to relax in after your walk if the weather is good. They also provide accommodation if you need to stay over in the area. You can find the pub in the village on Church Street with a postcode of BL7 8AB. It's located very near to Belmont Reservoir and Ward's Reservoir which makes for a nice stroll after your meal.  Pictured above: the Black Dog and Ward's Reservoir in Belmont. The Strawbury Duck is also right on the route in Entwistle. It's one of the area's landmark pubs and well worth stopping at for a drink or meal.
