  "description": "This circular walk starts and finishes in Witton Park near Blackburn . It's a lovely walk taking you first along the River Darwen and then past the 16th century Hoghton Tower before coming to the picturesque Belmont Reservoir . There are splendid views of the 1496 ft high Winter Hill on this section. At Jumbles Reservoir in Jumbles Country Park you will turn north passing Entwistle Reservoir and Wayoh Reservoir before climbing Darwen Hill where you will find Jubilee Tower. You can climb the 85 ft high tower for some splendid views of North Yorkshire, Morecambe Bay, Blackpool Tower, Cumbria, and the Isle of Man. This section also passes the pretty Roddlesworth Reservoir , Abbey Village Reservoir and Rake Brook Reservoir which are surrounded by nice woodland trails. The route finishes passing the town of Darwen and then descending into Witton Country Park .",
