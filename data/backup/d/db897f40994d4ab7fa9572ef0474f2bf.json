  "description": "This South Cambridgeshire village is located south of Cambridge and north of Royston. The small settlement has its own train station on the Great Northern Line, the main line between Cambridge and London. As such its a nice place to visit for a stroll with some pleasant public footpaths running off in different directions. It's also well known for Shepreth Wildlife Park where you can see a wide variety of animals including red pandas, llamas, monkeys and tigers. It's a nice place for a walk with little streams and good footpaths taking you around the site. This walk takes you north along public footpaths to the neighbouring village of Barrington. On the way there's some nice countryside and views of the River Rhee (or Cam) as you approach Barrington. You'll also pass along the outskirts of the wildlife park and the site of some ancient Roman buildings on the eastern side of Shepreth. To continue your walking in the area head south to neighbouring Melbourn where you can pick up the Harcamlow Way and the Icknield Way Path. These popular long distance trails are a great way of further exploring the countryside around the village. Another local walking highlight is Royston Heath where there's miles of trails and fine viewpoints with views over Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire.",
