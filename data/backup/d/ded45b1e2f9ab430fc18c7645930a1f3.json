  "description": "This shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line and National Cycle Route 62 from Silkstone Common to Wombwell. The multi user path runs for a distance of about 9 miles, passing Dodworth and Worsbrough Mill Country Park on the route. On the way there's nice views of the River Dove and the surrounding countryside. The route is entirely traffic free so ideal for families looking for a safe cycle or walk. You start off at Silkstone Common where you can pick up the trail just to the south of the railway station. Follow the trail east and it will take you to Worsbrough Country Park where there's an interesting 17th century mill and waterside paths along a pretty lake. The final section takes you past the Dearne Way and Wombwell Wood before finishing just east of Wombell at the RSPB Dearne Valley and the RSPB's Old Moor Nature Reserve. The wetland reserve is a great place to look out for a wide variety of water loving birds. There is also a car park here if you'd like to start from here instead. The trail uses a section of the epic Trans Pennine Trail if you would like to continue your outing.",
