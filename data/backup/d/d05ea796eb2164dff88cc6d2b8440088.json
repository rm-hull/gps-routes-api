The shaft was sunk through sixteen feet of wet gravel and sand in 1860 and operated until the 1926 coal strike which caused the decline of the pit, finally closing in 1928. There's some nice footpaths here around a small pond."

  "description": "This village is in a good spot for exploring the Mersey Forest. The village has some nice country trails, a local nature reserve and is also very close to the highest point in the county. This walk from the village heads east to climb to the viewpoint at Billinge Hill before visiting Orrell Water Park. The walk starts in the village and heads east through the Mersey Forest to Kings Moss. You continue north east past Brownlow before turning south to climb to Billinge Hill, the highest point in Merseyside. From the 179 m (587 ft) summit  there are excellent views towards Great Orme in Wales, Blackpool tower, Greater Manchester, Winter Hill and the Derbyshire Peak District. You'll also see a beacon tower at the summit and several large transmitter masts nearby. After taking in the views head north past Longshaw to visit Orrel Water Park. Here you'll find footpaths taking you to two pretty reservoirs surrounded by attractive woodland and a buttercup meadow.",
