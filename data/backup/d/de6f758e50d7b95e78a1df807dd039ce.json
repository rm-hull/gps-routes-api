  "description": "This beautiful arboretum near Oxford has a series of well laid out footpaths to try. There's 130 acres to explore with wildflower meadows, rhododendrons and bluebell woods. In the arboretum you will find giant redwoods, azaleas and monkey-puzzle trees. Many of the trees have been introduced from the Pacific North West region of North America. The lovely paths take you to the Serpentine Ride and peaceful glades. It really is a spectacular sight in autumn while in spring there are beautiful carpets of bluebells. In addition to the woodland there is a 67 acre wildflower meadow with views of the surrounding countryside. Look out for a variety of birdlife and the resident peacocks as you make your way through the grounds. Harcourt is located near to the Thames Path so this is a good option if you would like to extend your walk. Both Abingdon and Oxford are nearby.",

Just to the south west you can visit the worthy villages of Sutton Courtenay and Culham. The former picturesque settlement has several historic buildings including the 12th century Norman Hall and The Abbey - a Grade I listed medieval courtyard house. Culham has a particularly lovely lock and weir to admire. For more walking ideas in the area see the Oxfordshire Walks page."
