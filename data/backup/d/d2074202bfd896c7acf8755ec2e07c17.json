  "description": "Visit this lovely peninsula in Lancashire and enjoy great views across the River Lune and Morecambe Bay. It's a hidden gem of a walk with the changing tides, coastal birds and pretty old cottages to see. Sunderland Point is located near to both Heysham and Lancaster. The Point is a great place for a peaceful stroll with coastal views, salt marsh, beach, mud flats, farmland and lots of wildlife to look out for. These include birds such as Curlew, Heron and Peewit. You can park at Potts Corner at Alderley Bank to being the walk. Footpaths then take you along the coast to the village of Sunderland Point where you'll pass a series of attractive Georgian houses by the quay. The area is also home to Sambo's grave. The master of a slave or servant called Sambo left him at Sunderland Point in the 18th century where he subsequently died in the brewery. The grave is a tourist attraction decorated with flowers or stones painted by local children. To continue your walking in the area you could visit Morecambe Bay or try the Lune Estuary Footpath .",
