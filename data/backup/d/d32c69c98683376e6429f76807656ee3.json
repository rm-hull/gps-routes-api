  "description": "This large area of woodland near Penrith has miles of cycling and walking trails to try. The expansive area is popular with mountain bikers with several good climbs and descents to enjoy. The route starts from the north western end of the forest at Millfield Lodge near Hutton Roof. You can pick up the trails and head towards Tippy Hills and the high point near Bernard's Wood. The forest includes the pretty Gilcambon Beck and lots of wildlife to look out for too. Keep your eyes peeled for deer and owls as you make your way through the forest. The woods are located on the edge of the Lake District National Park. Heading west will take you into the park where you can pick up the Cumbria Way long distance trail and explore the Caldbeck Fells. Just to the south east you will find the town of Penrith where you can explore the medieval castle and enjoy a climb to Penrith Beacon.",
