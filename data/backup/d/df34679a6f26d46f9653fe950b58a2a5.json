  "description": "This lovely railway path runs from Swalwell, near Gateshead ,  to Consett alongside the River Derwent and is suitable for walkers and cyclists. You will pass the villages of Rowlands Gill, Hamsterley and Ebchester on the way. The path also takes you through Derwent Walk Country Park and there is a woodland section at Byerside Wood. At the park you could cross to the to the western side of the river and visit Thornley Woods where there's a sculpture trail and a visitor centre with lots of information about the area. Also of interest is the National Trust owned Gibside near Rowlands Gill. This is well worth a visit with its 18th-century landscape park and nature reserve. Near here there's also the popular Chopwell Wood where there's miles of walking and mountain bike trails to try.",
