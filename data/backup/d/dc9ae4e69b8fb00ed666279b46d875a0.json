  "description": "This circular walk follows the Shakespeare's Way long distance footpath from Chipping Norton to the Rollright Stones on the Oxfordshire/Warwickshire border. This fascinating group of Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monuments consists of three groups: the King's Men stone circle, the Whispering Knights burial chamber and the single King Stone. It is said that the stones are a representation of a king and his knights who had been turned to stone by a witch. The walk starts from the interesting market town of Chipping Norton. Highlights in the town include the pretty row of Almshouses, founded in 1640 and the church which dates from the 12th century. You then follow the Shakespeare's Way into the countryside towards Salford and Little Rollright before coming to the stones. It is about a 3 mile walk from Chipping Norton to the stones. You can turn it into a circular walk from Salford by following footpaths back from Brighthill Farm. To extend your walking in the area you could head north and visit the pretty Whichford Wood .",
