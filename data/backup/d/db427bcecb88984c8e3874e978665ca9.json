  "description": "Enjoy a circular cycle or walk around Loch Oich in the Scottish Highlands. On the western side of the loch you can follow challenging woodland trails through the forest above the loch in Invergarry. On the eastern side you can follow a flatter, waterside trail along the Great Glen Way. Good start points for the route are at the villages of Invergarry or Aberchalder. You could also start from the Forestry Commission car park at the southern end of the loch. Along the route you will pass the River Garry and the ruins of the 17th century Invergarry Castle. There's also attractive woodland and great views of the surrounding hills. You can extend the route by continuing along the Great Glen Way and the Caledonian Canal to the nearby Loch Lochy. Here you'll find a great traffic free cycle and walking trail running along the huge loch.",

The path starts at Dalwhinnie train station and provides splendid views of Ben Alder. Loch Rannoch with its expansive forest is also located in this area. Head west and there's a viewpoint car park and nice trails along Loch Garry. Also to the east is Loch Laggan and the Ardverikie Estate. The loch includes the largest freshwater beach in Britain. The expansive estate was also used for the BBC series Monarch of the Glen. On the northern side of the loch there's also the Creag Meagaidh Nature Reserve. The area includes a wide variety of interesting flora and fauna with several nationally important plant species. There's also a circular waymarked trail which will take you to a fine viewpoint. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
