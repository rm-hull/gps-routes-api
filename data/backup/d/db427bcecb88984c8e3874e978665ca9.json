  "description": "Enjoy a circular cycle or walk around Loch Oich in the Scottish Highlands. On the western side of the loch you can follow challenging woodland trails through the forest above the loch in Invergarry. On the eastern side you can follow a flatter, waterside trail along the Great Glen Way . Good start points for the route are at the villages of Invergarry or Aberchalder. You could also start from the Forestry Commission car park at the southern end of the loch. Along the route you will pass the River Garry and the ruins of the 17th century Invergarry Castle. There's also attractive woodland and great views of the surrounding hills. You can extend the route by continuing along the Great Glen Way and the Caledonian Canal to the nearby Loch Lochy . Here you'll find a great traffic free cycle and walking trail running along the huge loch.",
