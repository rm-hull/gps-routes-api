  "description": "Explore the delightful Blaise Castle Estate in Bristol, on this circular walk through the 650 acre country park. You will follow a series of peaceful wooded paths around the landscaped grounds and visit the sham castle where there are fabulous views of Avonmouth, the Avon Gorge and South Wales. Other highlights include two pools - the Giant's Soapdish and Penny Well, and two caves - the Robber's Cave and the Butcher's Cave. There is also a gorge with a limestone outcrop often used by climbers and Blaise Castle itself - a magnificent 18th century mansion house with a fascinating museum. There are several well laid out walking routes you can try in the estate. These include the Rhododendron walk, Castle walk and the Gorge walk. See the link below for route guides and pdf files with maps. To the west there's also Limekiln Wood leading to Kings Weston Hill where there's  an Iron Age hill fort, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.",
