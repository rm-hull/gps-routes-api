  "description": "This West Yorkshire based town sits in a nice position on the edge of the Peak District. There's some fine moorland scenery, a series of pretty reservoirs and several local hill climbs to enjoy around the town. This circular walk from the town explores the moorland to the west of the settlement. On the way you'll visit Meltham Moor, Wessenden Reservoir, Butterley Reservoir and Deer Hill Reservoir . The walk starts in the village and follows country lanes west and then south to visit Meltham Moor. You'll climb to Milston Hill before coming to West Nab which stands at a height of 500 metres. There's great views and some interesting rock formations to see here. The route continues west past Holly Bank Moss to link up with the Pennine Way at Leyzing Clough. Follow the waymarked trail north west and it will take you past Great Hey Cote Hill to Wessenden Reservoir and Blakeley Reservoir. There's some waterfalls and views of the Wessenden Brook in this area. The route then heads north along Blakeley Reservoir to Butterley Reservoir. You then head past Binn Moor and Holme Moss to Deer Hill Reservoir. From here paths take you south east back towards Meltham.",
