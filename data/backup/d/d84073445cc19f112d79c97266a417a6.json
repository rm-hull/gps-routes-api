  "description": "With its lakeside location the village of Bowness-on-Windermere is a lovely place to visit. This walk takes you along the lakeside before catching the ferry to the opposite side of the lake and exploring Claife Heights and Moss Eccles Tarn. You then pay a visit to Hill Top, the former home of children's author Beatrix Potter. Start the walk from the parking area at Windermere Quays. Then follow the paths past the quay where you can see all the boats departing for tours of the lake. Continue south to Cockshott Point where there is a nice grassy area, woodland and a good viewpoint across Windermere. The nice lakeside path continues to Ferry Nab where you can catch the Windermere Ferry to Far Sawrey. The ferry operates all year, with services every 20 minutes from early morning to mid-evening. The crossing takes less than 10 minutes and a small fee is charged. Follow the road through Far Sawrey before turning right at Cuckoo Brow Lane and picking up a bridleway heading up to Claife Heights and Moss Eccles Tarn. You can explore the Heights further if you wish by heading north through the woodland to Latterbarrow and Wray Castle. This walk visits the tarn before descending to Hill Top, the 17th century former home of children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter. You can enjoy tours around the house and see where Potter penned here famous books. The house is located in Near Sawrey where there's a nice pub for refreshments and a bus stop where you can catch a bus back to the ferry. To continue your walking in the town try the easy climb to Brant Fell for lovely views over the lake. You could also head up to the town of Windermere where you can enjoy a climb to the splendid Orrest Head viewpoint.",
