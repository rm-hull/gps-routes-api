The warren is a wooded area on the edge of the fens, located a short distance to the north of the village of Shouldham with a track to the parking and picnic area turning off Spring Lane. The undulating site is traversed by numerous unmarked paths offering good views across the open fenland. Much of the northern part, which slopes upwards towards a central plateau, is covered by conifers, some of which has recently been cleared. A deep ditch crossable only in three places - separates the northern from the southern parts of the woodland."

      "caption": "A view of the village church of All Saints in Shouldham. The church is situated on an elevation to the east of the village, looking down a hillside that shows evidence of extensive earthworks. The building dates mainly from the 14th century and is constructed from locally found carstone. It was extensively restored - with the chancel rebuilt to the designs of the London-based architect RJ Withers - in 1871. The pews date from 1871 and medieval bench ends were mounted onto some of them. The nave also contains several original C15 benches which have square ends with tracery cut into them, and the fine hammerbeam roof with carved angels is original also. The glass in the east window comes from Bell and Almond and was installed in 1877. The north nave window and the south chapel window are by the same artists and date from 1871 and 1872 respectively. An unusual memorial to Thomas Allen (d 1841) stands in the north-east corner of the chancel. The sculpture depicts Faith and is signed by W Groves who exhibited it in 1842 at the Royal Academy."

Immediately to the east and north-east of the village, on the south side of the Nar valley bottom which used to be a fen in medieval times, lies the site of the Priory of the Holy Cross and the Blessed Virgin. This site is a designated National Monument and contains the buried remains of monastic buildings, earthwork enclosures and remains of an extensive water management system including fishponds. The site can be accessed via the public footpath turning off Eastgate Street and leading to Marham, further to the east, which traverses it. Found within the same area there are also remains of a section of road which is believed to date from Roman times, and a Bronze Age cremation cemetery. The church of All Saints stands on an elevation above the site, looking down onto the village."

  "description": "This nature reserve near King's Lynn has some peaceful woodland walking trails. There's also cycling opportunities with some good mountain bike (mtb) trails to try. Start the walk from the car park located about a mile north of Shouldham village. From here you can pick up the woodland trails which include two colour coded waymarked walks: the Yellow walk (1 kilometre) and the Red walk (about 3 kilometres). In the reserve there's beautiful pine woodlands and fine views across the fenland countryside and the Nar Valley from the outskirts. There's also a stunning Rhododendron Avenue and a nice picnic area. After you've explored the nature reserve you can head into Shouldham village where there are picturesque cottages, a village green and an interesting 14th century church to see.",
