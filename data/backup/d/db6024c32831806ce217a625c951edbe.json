  "description": "This walk explores lovely Arkengarthdale, the northernmost of the Yorkshire Dales. The route through the dale takes you along the Arkle Beck from Langthwaite to Whaw Bridge. The walk starts from the car park at Langthwaite and then picks up footpaths heading north west along the pretty beck towards Whaw and Seahouses. Along the way there's picturesque old bridges, evidence of the area's mining history and fine views of the surrounding dales countryside. To continue your walking in the area head south to Reeth where you can enjoy more waterside walking along the River Swale. If you continue north west through the dale you will eventually come to the splendid Tan Hill Inn . The Inn is world famous as Britain\u2019s highest public house at 1,732 feet (528m) above sea level. It dates back to the 17th century and has a wonderful interior with exposed beams, stone-flagged floor and welcoming fire. There's also a nice outdoor seating area with some of the best views in the country. You can find the inn on the Long Causeway at a postcode of DL11 6ED.",
