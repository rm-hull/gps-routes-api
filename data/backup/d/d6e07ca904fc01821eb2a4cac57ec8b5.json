  "description": "A circular walk around the Wiltshire town of Malmesbury visiting the historic abbey and the River Avon. It's a very attractive town with numerous historic buildings, a photogenic market cross and picturesque river scenes to enjoy. The walk starts at the 12th century abbey which has a history stretching back to the 7th century. It's one of the premium attractions in the county with stunning architecture and a fascinating history. You can also visit the Abbey House Gardens which cover 5 acres and have some fine topiary. Head north past the Cloister Gardens and you will soon come to the Tetbury Branch of the River Avon. You can follow a series of nice riverside paths around the town before returning to the centre. Here you will pass the noteworthy Malmesbury Market Cross. The cross was built in the 15th century possibly using stone salvaged from the recently ruined part of the abbey. There's also a number of 16th-century almshouses and the medieval Tower House. It contains a high-roofed main hall where it is said Henry VIII dined after hunting in nearby Bradon Forest.",
