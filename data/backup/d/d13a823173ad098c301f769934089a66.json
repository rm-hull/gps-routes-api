  "description": "This village is located in the Harrogate district of North Yorkshire. The rural village can be reached by rail on the Harrogate line which runs from Leeds to York via Knaresborough and Harrogate. Local walking highlights include the neighbouring village of Nun Monkton and the historic Beningbrough Hall. Nun Monkton is located just a few miles to the east at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and River Nidd. On the opposite side of the river there's the 18th century hall with its beautiful grounds and gardens. This little walk from the village follows a country lane south to visit neighbouring Kirk Hammerton. On the way there's nice views of the surrounding countryside and a visit to the River Nidd which flows just to the south of the village.",
