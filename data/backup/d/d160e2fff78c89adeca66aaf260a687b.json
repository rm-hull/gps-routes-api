The river is a picturesque waterway rising near Brockhampton in Gloucestershire and flowing southeast for about 50 kilometres before joining the Thames near Lechlade. Along its course, the river meanders through charming villages such as Withington, Bibury, and Coln St Aldwyns, offering scenic views of traditional Cotswold landscapes. Here in Bibury, the River Coln is a central feature, winding through the village and past Arlington Row. This section is particularly noted for its beauty, with the river's crystal-clear waters providing a habitat for trout and other aquatic life."

Arlington Row is a quintessential symbol of English heritage and Cotswold charm. Originally built in 1380 as a monastic wool store, the row was converted into weavers\u2019 cottages in the 17th century. The cottages housed workers who produced cloth for Arlington Mill, located nearby. This transition highlights Bibury\u2019s historical significance in the wool trade, which was central to the economy of the Cotswolds during the medieval and post-medieval periods.  Now managed by the National Trust, Arlington Row is a Grade I listed structure and one of England\u2019s most photographed landmarks. Its honey-coloured limestone cottages, steeply pitched roofs, and idyllic setting along the River Coln have made it an enduring symbol of rural England. The cottages are still occupied, though one is available as a holiday let through the National Trust, allowing visitors a chance to experience this iconic site firsthand."

Likely established in the Saxon period, the church was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. It was associated with St Mary\u2019s Priory in Worcester and later transferred to Osney Abbey near Oxford until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The church showcases a blend of architectural styles. Its Saxon origins are visible in remnants of gravestones and the chancel columns, while Norman influences are evident in the doorway arches. The 13th-century modifications brought Gothic features, such as the square font and a distinctive chancel arch that uniquely combines Saxon and Gothic elements. The 15th-century additions include the striking timber roof and a large Perpendicular-style west window. Noteworthy too are the nine aumbry cupboards in the chancel, suggesting the church once housed a significant collection of valuables."

The mill's operation would have been powered by the river, and its proximity to Rack Isle\u2014historically used for drying wool\u2014ties it to the village's weaving and fabric-making past. Today, the mill is a private residence and no longer open to the public.

Arlington Mill stands near other iconic locations like Arlington Row and the Rack Isle nature reserve, making it a key landmark in a village celebrated for its history and unspoiled beauty"
