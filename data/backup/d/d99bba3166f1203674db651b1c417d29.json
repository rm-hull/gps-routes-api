  "description": "A cycle and walking route around the beautiful Grafham Water in Cambridgeshire. The route passes through woodland and the villages of Grafton and West Perry. There is also a nature reserve at the western end of the lake where you will see a variety of birdlife. Sailboats are also common during the warmer months of the year. Cycle hire is available at the start of the route at the eastern end of the reservoir. It's possible to create a longer circular walk around the lake using The Three Shires Way long distance trail. The waymarked footpath runs towards Great Staughton on the southern side of the reservoir. It will take you through some nice countryside before returning to the lakeside. To extend your walking in the area you could visit the nearby Brampton Wood . The woods are located less than a mile from Grafham and can be reached by cycling along National Cycle Route 12 .",
