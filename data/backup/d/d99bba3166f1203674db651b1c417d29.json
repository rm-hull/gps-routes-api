  "description": "A cycle and walking route around the beautiful Grafham Water in Cambridgeshire. The route passes through woodland and the villages of Grafton and West Perry. There is also a nature reserve at the western end of the lake where you will see a variety of birdlife. Sailboats are also common during the warmer months of the year. Cycle hire is available at the start of the route at the eastern end of the reservoir. It's possible to create a longer circular walk around the lake using The Three Shires Way long distance trail. The waymarked footpath runs towards Great Staughton on the southern side of the reservoir. It will take you through some nice countryside before returning to the lakeside. To extend your walking in the area you could visit the nearby Brampton Wood. The woods are located less than a mile from Grafham and can be reached by cycling along National Cycle Route 12 .",

The riverside pub has dining area opening out on to the lower mill pond viewing deck. Outside there are lots of picnic tables alongside the upper mill pond and the marina. It's a lovely place to relax on a summer day. You can find it about 1 mile south of the reserve at postcode PE19 8GW."

In all there's 200 acres to explore with habitats including meadow, reedbed, scrub and woodland. It's another good option if you are looking for some more waterside walking nearby. Just to the west is the interesting town of Kimbolton where you can visit the historic Kimbolton Castle. The castle is notable as the final home of King Henry VIII's first wife, Catherine of Aragon.
