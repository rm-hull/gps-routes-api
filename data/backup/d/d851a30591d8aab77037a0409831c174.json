In about 1580 Shakespeare had been sent, by his Stratford schoolmaster, to be an assistant teacher in the household of Alexander Hoghton at Lea Hall near Preston, and the \"wilim Shakeshaft nowe dwellynge with me\", referred to by Hoghton in his will, is almost certainly Shakespeare."

  "description": "This walk visits the National Trust's Rufford Old Hall in Lancashire. The timber framed, black and white house dates back to 1530 when it was built for Sir Robert Hesketh. The historic hall has lovely gardens and trails along the Rufford Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal which runs through the grounds. In the parkland you'll find some attractive woodland with carpets of bluebells in the spring months and snowdrops in late winter. The hall is located less than a mile east of Mere Sands Wood. You could combine your outing to the hall with a visit to this nature reserve where you can enjoy a series of lakes and lots of water loving wildlife.",
