  "description": "These woods near Netherton have miles of trails to follow through attractive woodland. There's pretty streams, becks and a series of ponds to enjoy. Also look out for lots of bluebells in the spring and a variety of woodland birds. Most of the route is on fairly flat paths but towards the southern end of the site it does get quite hilly. As such a reasonable level of fitness is required if you are going to walk the length of the woods. You can access Coxley Woods just to the north west of Netherton in Wakefield. Then pick up the trails heading south along the Coxley Beck and the ponds. You then pass through Perkin Wood and Stony Cliffe Wood before turning around and returning to the northern end of the site. The Kirklees Way long distance trail, passes to the west of the woods. You can pick this up to continue your walking in the Wakefield area. You could follow the trail south and visit the splendid Bretton Country Park and Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Here you will find 500 acres of lakes and parkland, with a myriad of footpaths to follow. Following the trail north will take you into Dewsbury where you could explore Dewsbury Country Park .",
