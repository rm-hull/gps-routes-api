  "description": "This route follows a disused railway line near Alsager and Sandbach . The trail runs for just under 2 miles along a surfaced path, suitable for cyclists and walkers. Start the walk from the Salt Line and Borrow Pit Meadows car park at Smithy Grove. It's located just south of the Trent and Mersey Canal at Hassall Green (postcode for sat navs CW11 4YB). From here you can pick up the trail and follow it south east to Day Green and Lawton Heath End on the outskirts of Alsager. On the way you'll pass the Borrow Pit Meadows nature reserve where you'll find habitats including meadows, woodland, wetland, grassland, farmland and scrub.\u00a0The reserve is a nice place for a stroll with lots of birdlife to look out for.",
