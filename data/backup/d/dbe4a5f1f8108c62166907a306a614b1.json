  "description": "Hepworth is located just east of Holmfirth in the Holme Valley area of West Yorkshire. There's lots of great options for walkers with several waymarked trails, hill climbs and a series of local reservoirs to visit. Viewers of long running tv show Last of the Summer Wine may recognise the village as the 'Butchers Arms' pub was regularly used as a setting in the show. This walk from the village uses a section of the Barnsley Boundary Walk to visit a series of local reservoirs. On the walk you'll visit Broadstone Reservoir before heading to the Scout Dike, Royd Moor and Ingbirchworth Reservoirs near Penistone. The walk starts in the village and heads east where you can pick up the Barnsley Boundary Walk. Follow the waymarked footpath east and it will take you past Broadstone Reservoir to the neighbourging village of Ingbirchworth and its reservoir. Just to the south of here you will also find Scout Dike and Royd Moor Reservoir. Here you can pick up the Penistone Boundary Walk, a circular trail exploring the area around the town, with some nice views of the River Don .",
