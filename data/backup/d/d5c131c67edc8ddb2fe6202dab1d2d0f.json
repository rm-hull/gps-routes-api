  "description": "This pretty village sits in an enviable location on both the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and the Caerfanell river. It's also a great base for exploring the Brecon Beacons National Park with several fine hill climbs to try nearby. This circular walk from the village takes you south to visit two of the walking highlights of the area at Talybont Reservoir and the Blaen y Glyn Waterfalls. You can reach both of these sites by following the Taff Trail south from the village. The popular cycling and walking trail will take you along the eastern side of the reservoir and through the adjacent forest. To the west of the lake you'll come to Blaen y Glyn where you will find a series of beautiful waterfalls along a popular walking trail. The Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal runs through the village. You can continue your walking in the area by following the flat towpath to Brecon on the Brecon to Talybont Canal Walk .",
