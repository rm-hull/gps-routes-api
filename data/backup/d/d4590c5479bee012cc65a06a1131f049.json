The impressive castle dates from the 15th century and has a fascinating history. You can enjoy a walk around the castle grounds and along the lakeside with wonderful views over the water to the surrounding mountains. The lough is the largest of the three\u00a0lakes of Killarney. Muckross Lake is the deepest and lies just to the south. It includes a fine 14km (8.7 mile) circular trail with views back to Lough Leane.",
