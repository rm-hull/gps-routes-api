He then leased the castle and the lands to Sir Valentine Browne, ancestor of the Earls of Kenmare."

At the end of the wars, the Brownes were able to show that their heir was too young to have taken part in the rebellion and they retained the lands. By about 1688, they had erected a mansion house near the castle, but their adherence to King James II of England after the Glorious Revolution caused them to be exiled. The castle became a military barracks, which remained so until early in the 19th century. The Brownes did not return to live at Ross but built Kenmare House near Killarney."

  "description": "This walk visits the historic Ross Castle on Lough Leane in the Killarney National Park, County Kerry. The impressive castle dates from the 15th century and has a fascinating history. You can enjoy a walk around the castle grounds and along the lakeside with wonderful views over the water to the surrounding mountains. The lough is the largest of the three lakes of Killarney. Muckross Lake is the deepest and lies just to the south. It includes a fine 14km (8.7 mile) circular trail with views back to Lough Leane.",

      "content": "Just to the east there's Lough Guitane where there's a nice walking trail on the eastern side of the scenic lough. To the north west there's Annascaul Lake on the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry. The picturesque lake sits in a wonderful remote spot surrounded by mountains and a beautiful river valley. Here you can also pick up the Dingle Way, an epic circular walk classified as one of Ireland's National Waymarked Trails. Also of interest is the popular climb to Carrauntoohil in the MacGillycuddy's Reeks mountain range. Here you can climb to the highest mountain in Ireland and enjoy some incredible views from the summit."
