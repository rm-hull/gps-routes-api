  "description": "Enjoy splendid views over the Severn Vale from this lovely open space near Stroud. The common covers nearly 300 acres and is criss crossed with miles of nice footpaths. There is a car park towards the eastern side of the common with direct access to the well surfaced paths. The area is a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest and also a Local Nature Reserve. Look out for various wildflowers and several species of orchid including Frog Orchid, Bee Orchid and Musk Orchid. The common consists of attractive grassland, scrub and woodland with Beech and Ash trees. It's also great for wildlife with over 30 species of butterfly flying around the pretty wildflowers. Look out for the rare Duke of Burgundy and Adonis blue. The common is in an elevated position above Stroud so on a clear day there are far reaching views towards the Forest of Dean and the Welsh hills. If you would like to extend your walk then you could head to the nearby Woodchester Park. This National Trust owned park has miles of good footpaths taking you through the tranquil wooded valley to five pretty lakes. The National Trust also manages Minchinhampton Common which has more nice footpaths and views to enjoy. You could also pick up the Cotswold Canals Walk and enjoy waterside walking through Stroud and the surrounding countryside. Also nearby there is Selsley Common which has more nice footpaths, interesting vegetation and great views. Just north of Stroud is Haresfield Beacon with miles of cycling and walking trails.",
