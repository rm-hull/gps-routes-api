  "description": "This lovely country park surrounds the Golden Grove mansion in Carmarthenshire. There's a number of walking trails taking you around the woodland and parkland on the estate. Features include a deer park, roaming peacocks, fine views of the Tywi Valley and a splendid aboretum with many champion trees. There's great facilities with a visitor centre, tea room and an education centre where you can learn all about the interesting history of the estate. To continue your walking in the area head a couple of miles north east to visit Dinefwr Park in Llandeilo. There's much to enjoy here with a historic 12th-century Welsh castle, 18th-century landscaped park and a medieval deer park. Near here you can also enjoy a climb to the viewpoint and Iron Age Hill Forts on Garn Goch .",

Here you can explore the grounds and enjoy fine views over the surrounding Brecon Beacons from the elevated position of the limestone precipice on which the castle sits. To the south east is Ammanford where you can enjoy nice trails through the River Amman Valley and pick up the Heart of Wales Line Trail. A short driver to the north you'll find the expansive Brechfa Forest. The forest has miles of good walking trails and mountain bike trails to try. The ancient village of Brechfa is also worth exploring with its wonderful old pub. On the south eastern fringe of the forest there's Abergorlech where you can enjoy a riverside walk through the Cothi Valley and explore the wonderful ruins of the 12th century Talley Abbey."
