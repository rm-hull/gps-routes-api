On the way you'll visit the lovely Upper and Lower Glendevon Reservoirs and enjoy views of the River Devon. A trail heads west from the A823 along the River Devon past the dam and weir before coming to the reservoirs. You can follow the trail past Corim Hill before finishing at the Boat House at the Upper reservoir. There is a parking area by the roadside near Glenhead Farm and the Meadow Burn where you can start the walk from. Just to the south you can explore Glen Sherup where you can visit the Glen Sherup Reservoir before a climb to the viewpoint at Ben Shee.",
