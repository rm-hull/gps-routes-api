  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Hurstwood Reservoir in Burnley. Start the walk from the public car park in the village of Hurstwood just to the west of the reservoir. It's located just over 2 miles south east from Burnley town centre. From here you can pick up footpaths heading around the water for a distance of just under 2 miles. It's a peaceful spot with lovely views over the water to the surrounding Pennine Moors and hills. The Burnley Way passes the reservoir so there is good scope for extending the walk on this waymarked footpath. If you follow it east you could visit the nearby Gorple Reservoir and Widdop Reservoir for example.",

It's in a lovely spot with views over the surrounding Pennine Moors from the outdoor seating area. The pub also has an interesting history being named after a thoroughbred horse which won the Epsom Derby in 1861. You can find the inn at 302 Red Lees Road with a postcode of BB10 4RG for your sat navs."

      "content": "After exploring the reservoir you could enjoy a stroll around the pretty hamlet of Hurstwood. There's rows of cottages, an old church and the 16th century Hurstwood Hall to see here. The hall, the Great Barn next to it, and Spenser House are Grade II* listed buildings and believed to have been constructed in late 16th century. Scenes from the 1996 BBC adaptation of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall were filmed at Spenser House and Hurstwood Hall. To further continue your walking then simply pick up the Pennine Bridleway which runs right past the reservoir. If you follow it south you can visit Cant Clough Reservoir and Worsthorne Moor. Cant Clough tends to have less visitors so is a nice spot for a quieter walk. For more walking ideas in the area see the South Pennines Walks page."
