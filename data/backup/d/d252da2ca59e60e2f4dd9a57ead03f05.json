The castle was built by the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great during the early 13th century, at the base of the Llanberis Pass. The castle features a large stone keep, which historian Richard Avent considers \"the finest surviving example of a Welsh round tower\"."

  "description": "This circular walk from Llanberis visits Llyn Padarn and Llyn Peris from the village. There's some nice lakeside paths leading to the ruins of Dolbadarn Castle, located on the south western side of the lakes. You can start the walk from the lakeside car park at Llyn Padarn, in the village. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south east to the castle which is located in a fine spot between Llyn Padarn and Llyn Peris. The route then heads west to visit the woodland trails in Coed Victoria. You can follow peaceful trails through the woods to the Llanberis Waterfall. The route then heads north through the town to return to the car park. To extend the walk you could cross to the other side and explore Padarn Country Park. For cyclists there's Lon Las Peris on the western side of the water. The surfaced trail runs along a tree lined path on the old railway line.",

      "content": "For wonderful views over the area try the climb to the nearby Moel Eilio. You could also pick up the Snowdon Llanberis Path and head south east towards Llyn Llydaw. On the fringes of the country park there's the fascinating Dinorwic Quarry to explore. At one time the quarry was the second largest slate quarry in the world. You can pick up the tramway trail footpath across the site just north of the visitor centre. The quarry is one of the significant sites on the Snowdonia Slate Trail which runs through the area. The circular long distance trail can be used to visit several of the other historic mining areas located in the World Heritage Site. Heading north along the trail would take you to Bethesda where you could visit the Penrhyn Quarry which was the largest slate quarry in the world during the 19th century. Heading south along the trail would take you to Dorothea Quarry where you'll find the remains of the old mining houses and a series of scenic lakes including Llyn Nantlle Uchaf. The Llyn Peris Walk takes you up the steep zig zag path at the northern end of the lake. There are some fabulous views down to the lake from this elevated position. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
