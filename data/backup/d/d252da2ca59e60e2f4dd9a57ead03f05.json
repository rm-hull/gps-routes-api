The castle was built by  the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great during the early 13th century, at the base of the Llanberis Pass. The castle features a large stone keep, which historian Richard Avent considers \"the finest surviving example of a Welsh round tower\"."

  "description": "This circular walk from Llanberis visits Llyn Padarn and Llyn Peris from the village. There's some nice lakeside paths leading to the ruins of Dolbadarn Castle, located on the south western side of the lakes. You can start the walk from the lakeside car park at Llyn Padarn, in the village. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south east to the castle which is located in a fine spot between Llyn Padarn and Llyn Peris. The route then heads west to visit the woodland trails in Coed Victoria. You can follow peaceful trails through the woods to the Llanberis Waterfall. The route then heads north through the town to return to the car park. To extend the walk you could cross to the other side and explore Padarn Country Park. For cyclists there's Lon Las Peris on the western side of the water. The surfaced trail runs along a tree lined path on the old railway line.",
