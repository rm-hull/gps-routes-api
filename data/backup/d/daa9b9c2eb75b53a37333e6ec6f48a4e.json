  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk through this pleasant area of woodland near Bournemouth. There are miles of good tracks to explore the area which includes woodland, heathland and ponds. The Moors River also runs past the western edge of the wood where you will also be able to see Bournemouth Airport. There is a parking area on Matchams Lane from which this route starts. You can see this on the street view link below. To extend your outing head to the nearby Avon Heath Country Park near Ringwood. Parley Common is also only a mile to the west in Ferndown where you can pick up the circular Ferndown, Stour and Forest Trail. The pleasant route explores Ferndown Forest and the wildlife rich Holt Heath National Nature Reserve. The popular Castleman Trailway can also be picked up here and followed along a disused railway line to Ringwood or Poole.",

The reserve includes dry and wet heath and is teeming with rare wildlife. The adjacent Ramsdown Forest includes a fine viewpoint with views over Hurn Airport and the forest. A little further to the south there's another viewpoint at St Catherine's Hill on the outskirts of Christchurch. Also nearby is the town of Verwood. Here you can enjoy a walk around Verwood Forest, the Cranborne Common Nature Reserve and the Stephen's Castle Nature Reserve where there's a lovely viewpoint. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dorset Walks page."
