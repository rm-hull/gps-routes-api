  "description": "A splendid figure of eight walk through the stunning Quantock Hils AONB. The walk begins at the pretty village of Broomfield which is the highest village on the Quantock Hills. The first section takes you to the tiny village of West Bagborough and then up a steep climb through Floorey Down and Great Wood. Another long woodland section then follows leading you to the village of Holford on the River Holford. From here, the path leads you through the delightful Stowborrow Deer Park on the way to West Quantoxhead and then Crowcombe where you will pass the Grade I listed Crowcombe court, dating from the 18th century. You then head back through the Great Wood and through Enmore and Goathurst before returning to Broomfield.",
