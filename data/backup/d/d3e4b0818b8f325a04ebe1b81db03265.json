  "description": "This small Hampshire town is beautifully positioned with riverside walks, nature reserves, woodland and hill climbs to enjoy. Several waymarked walking trails also pass through the area surrounding the town. This circular walk uses the Test Way and the Clarendon Way to visit some of the walking highlights around Stockbridge. You'll enjoy riverside paths along the River Test, visit the National Trust's Stockbridge Marsh, pass through the pretty village of King's Somborne and then climb up onto Stockbridge Down for fine views of the area. The route starts near the centre of the town at the Lion's Den Car Park (postcode:SO20 6JA). From here you can pick up the Test Way and follow the waymarked footpath south to take you past Common Marsh (owned by the National Trust), Marsh Court, Yew Hill and Hooper's Farm. On Stockbridge Marsh look out for a variety of wildlife including reed and sedge warblers, swans, moorhens, kingfishers, mistle thrush and reed buntings.  When you reach How Park Farm you can pick up the Clarendon Way and follow it east into King's Somborne where there are some pretty thatched cottages. After passing the village the route turns north to follow paths through the countryside to North Park Wood and then up onto Stockbridge Down. The down is a great place for a walk with great views across Hampshire and Salisbury Plain from its elevated position. It's run by the National Trust and is set in a sea of intensively farmed land, with horses and cattle. After exploring the Down the route then descends to the south and west before returning to the town centre.",
