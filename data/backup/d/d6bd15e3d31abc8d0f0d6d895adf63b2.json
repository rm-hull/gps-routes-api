  "description": "This walk explores Llanddwyn Island (Ynys Llanddwyn) on the Isle of Anglesey. The small tidal island is a stunningly beautiful location with rolling dunes, rocky outcrops, sandy beaches, lovely bays and the atmospheric ruins of St Dwynwen's Church. You can park at the Newborough Warren car park just to the north east of the island. Then follow the woodland trails through Newborough Forest to reach the island. Footpaths then head south toward the Twr Mawr lighthouse which marks the western entrance to the\u00a0Menai Strait. The noteworthy structure is similar in style to the Anglesey\u00a0windmills and stands at a height of\u00a033 feet (10\u00a0m). From here there are fabulous views to Snowdonia and the Lleyn Peninsula. The island is attached to Newborough Forest where you can extend your walk if you have time. The large coastal forest forms part of the Newborough Warrent Nature Reserve where you can look out for wildlife including oystercatchers, lapwings, curlew, skylarks and meadow pipits. The long distance Anglesey Coast Path also passes the island. You can follow the trail north and visit the lovely Malltraeth Sands and the Afon Cefni on the Lon Las Cefni Cycle Trail. Following the path east will take you along the Menai Strait to Menai Bridge . You can virtually explore the island using the google street view link below!",
