  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside walk along the western shore of this large reservoir in the Peak District. The walk begins at the parking area at the northern end of Upper Ladybower reservoir and follows a good walking trail to Lower Ladybower Reservoir. The route passes through some pleasant woodland and has wonderful views of the surrounding countryside. Highlights on the path include the views of the photogenic Derwent Valley Aqueduct and the Ashopton viaduct which carries the Snale Pass over the water.\u00a0Other walking trails lead up into the surrounding hills where you can enjoy great views over the reservoir. If you would like to continue your walk you could climb to the spectacular geological rock formations of Alport Castles . You could also pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way which runs past the southern end of the reservoir. A short climb to the east of the reservoir you will find the exhilarating Bamford Edge . From here you can enjoy fabulous views back across the water. At the southern end of the water you can park at the Heatherdene car park and enjoy a climb to Win Hill which has some of the best views over the reservoir. Around here you can also pick up the Thornhill Trail cycling and walking trail. It runs from the Ladybower Dam to Bamford station along a disused railway line. Also of interest are the wonderful climbs to Derwent Edge and Stanage Edge while the adjacent Derwent Reservoir also has some nice waterside paths.",
