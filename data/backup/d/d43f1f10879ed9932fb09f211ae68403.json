  "description": "Explore the peaceful Alice Holt Forest on this pleasant circular route in Farnham . The trail makes use of National Cycle routes 224 and 22 which run through the forest. The route starts and finshes at Bentley rail station and follows the tracks through the forest, before returning along a lovely quiet country lane, giving splendid views of the surrounding Hampshire countryside. The path also passes Birdworld with its 26 acres of wildlife including Maribou Stork, Sunbirds, Penguins, Owls, Parrots, Waterfowl and flamingos. This trail is also suitable for walkers although you may wish to return to Bentley rail on one of the forest trails rather than along the country lanes. To extend your exercise you could head towards the worthy village of Tilford and visit Frensham Ponds where there's some fine waterside trails around the two large ponds. Just to the east there are more nice woodland trails in Bourne Woods , site of Ridley Scott's Robin Hood Film set from his 2010 film starring Russell Crowe.",
