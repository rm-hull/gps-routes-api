  "description": "This walk in West Lothian visits the Lochcote Reservoir before a climb to the viewpoint on Cockleroy Hill. The pretty lake and viewpoint are located in between Bathgate and Linlithgow. Start the walk from the little village of Torphichen where you can follow country lanes north and then east to reach the reservoir. You continue east past the remains of the old castle before the climb to Cockleroy Hill. From the 278 metre high summit there are some excellent views back down to the lake and to the surrounding Bathgate Hills and countryside. Cockleroy sits on the western edge of Beecraigs Country Park so it's easy to extend the walk if you have time. The park includes extensive woodland and the picturesque Beecraigs Loch on the eastern side of the site. You could also continue north into Linlithgow where you can enjoy more waterside walks along Linlithgow Loch and the Union Canal on the Linlithgow Canal Walk .",
