  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Fife Coastal Path from St Andrews To Leuchars. The route runs for just over 6 miles, following a flat path that can also be used for cycling. Starting on the coast at St Andrews you head north west, passing the famous golf course where The Open has been played many times. You then continue along the lovely Eden Estuary where you can see a wide variety of wading birds. At Guardbridge you cross the River Eden on an ancient bridge, passing the Bird Observatory and the Paper Mill. The final section crosses Motray Water before finishing in Leuchars. You can extend the walk on the Tayport To Tentsmuir Walk which will take you through the splendid Tentsmuir Forest with its red squirrels and roe deer. You can also visit the wildlife rich Morton Lochs here as well. In the other direction there's the popular St Andrews to Anstruther Coastal Walk which visits the historic village of Crail.",
