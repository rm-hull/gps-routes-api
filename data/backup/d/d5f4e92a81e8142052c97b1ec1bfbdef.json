The impressive structure was built in 1872 for cloth manufacturer William Bliss, to make fine tweed cloth from locally produced wool. It was designed by the architect George Woodhouse of Bolton, who also designed mills in Lancashire, including Victoria Mill in Miles Platting; Woodhouse was also involved in the construction of Bolton Town Hall. The mill closed in 1980 and was converted into residential apartments in around 1988."
