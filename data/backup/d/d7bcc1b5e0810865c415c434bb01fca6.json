The driveway must have been constructed between then and 1850, or probably before 1840 when the Leeds and Manchester Railway was constructed. The bridge crosses the Shepley Bridge Cut, which opened in 1776."

  "description": "This walk runs from Brighouse to Mirfield along a section of the Calder and Hebble Navigation Canal and the River Calder. The walk runs for just under 5 miles and follows the canal towpath or riverside footpaths for most of the route. Along the way you'll pass lots of pretty locks, old bridges and barges. Start the walk in Brighouse on the southern side of the river and head east through Birds Royd and Woodhouse where you follow the canal towpath past Bradley Park and the Kirklees Cut. Here there's a pretty lock and lockeepers hut. The route then follows a section of the Kirklees Way through Bradley before rejoining the canal to Battyeford. You continue along the towpath for a short while before arriving in Mirfield.",
