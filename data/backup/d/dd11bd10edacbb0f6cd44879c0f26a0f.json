  "description": "This walk follows public footpaths alongside the track of the old Bromyard Light Railway. You can pick up the trails to the south east of the town around Washcroft. This walk just explores a small area around the railway but in 2022 plans were announced to convert more of the line into a shared cycling and walking route. The Worcester, Bromyard and Leominster Railway was closed in 1952 but remained open from Bromyard to Worcester until the Beeching axes in 1964. To continue your walking in the area you could explore Bromyard Downs or the expansive Brockhampton Estate which lies just to the north.",
