  "description": "A circular cycling and walking route on lanes and bridleways within the boundary of the MOD's busy Sennybridge Army Training Area. The establishment of the Epynt Way, has gone some way to compensating for the reduction in public access across this attractive area by the MOD. The village of Llangammarch Wells with its railway station makes a good access point for the route. On the way there are lovely views towards Mynydd Epynt and the Brecon Beacons. The route is waymarked with a disc featuring a white horse.",

Near here there's also the the market town of Llandovery where you can visit the ruined 13th century castle and enjoy footpaths along the River Towy. The town of Builth Wells is close to the eastern side of the route. The epic Wye Valley Walk can be picked up here."
