  "description": "This walk visits a delightful wooden glen on the east coast of the Isle of Man, a few miles south of Ramsey. You can access the glen from the Dhoon Glen Halt station on the Manx Electric Railway. From here you can pick up footpaths taking you into the pretty glen with its picturesque waterfalls and streams. The trails will take you east to the coast where there are splendid views over Dhoonn Bay. On the way look out for a variety of woodland birds and wild goats as you approach the coast. There's also lots of pretty heather and other interesting flora during the late summer. Below is the cove at Dhoonn Bay which includes a tranquil pebble beach and some splendid rock formations. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Raad ny Foillan - Isle of Man Coastal Path. The waymarked path can be followed north to Ramsey or south toward Douglas and Groudle Glen. There's a similar walk here with the added bonus of the popular Groudle Glen Railway, a delightful miniature railway run by local enthusiasts.",
