  "description": "The village of Lustleigh is in a nice position for exploring a lovely part of the Dartmoor National Park. This circular walk takes you to Lustleigh Cleave, a 'cliff' or 'cleft', to the east of the village. It's a great place for walkers with many footpaths leading to fields, meadows, woods and riverside trails along the River Bovey. The Cleave is also teeming with interesting flora and fauna. Look out for widlife including deer, butterflies and the dipper bird by the river. In the spring you can also see lots of bluebells and foxgloves. The walk starts in the centre of the village and follows country lanes south west to Pethybridge. Around here you can pick up woodland trails heading north west to Lustleigh Cleave, passing Sharpitor on the way. The walk bends round past Horsham Cleave and picks up woodland trails in Pullabrook Woods. Here you follow a nice waterside path along the River Bovey into Houndtor Wood. You then head through Hisley Wood before returning to the Lustleigh. The village is also a great place for a stroll with delightful thatched cottages, the lovely Primrose Tea Rooms, a cricket field, a communal apple orchard and a splendid village pub for refreshments after your walk. Also take time to visit the 13th century church where you can see the ancient Datuidoc's Stone which dates from the 6th century. To continue your walking in the area try the Becky Falls Walk which starts from nearby Manaton.  It's a great area for walkers with 4 colour coded trails, taking you through woodland to the Main Falls and the Lower Falls. Part of this walk uses the Dartmoor Way which runs just to the south of the village. The long distance trail is a great way to see many of the highlights of the National Park. Also nearby is the climb to Hound Tor where you can enjoy fine views over the area.",
