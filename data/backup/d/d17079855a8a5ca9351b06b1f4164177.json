  "description": "The Cheshire town of Knutsford has some lovely country walks to try. Highlights close to the town include the famous Tatton Park , the wildlife haven of Rostherne Mere and the North Cheshire Way long distance trail which passes through the town. This walk takes you from the town through Tatton Park to Rostherne Mere where there are lots of bird watching opportunites. The walk starts from Knutsford train station and heads north to first visit Knutsford Moor. The Moor is a pretty park which forms the extreme southern tip of Tatton Mere. There's waterside paths, reed beds, wildlife and wildflowers to see here during the summer months. The route then proceeds into the expansive Tatton Park. One of Cheshire's highlights the lovely park includes miles of footpaths taking you to two pretty meres, open parkland and attractive woodland. After passing through the northern end of the park you will come to Rostherne Mere. The lovely mere is a great place to look out for birdlife with several water loving birds visiting the area. After enjoying the mere the route then returns to the town centre and the train station on the same paths.",
