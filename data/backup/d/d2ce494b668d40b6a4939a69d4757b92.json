  "description": "This large area of woodland in in Dumfries and Galloway is a great place for walking and cycling. You can start the walk at the Dalbeattie Forest Town Wood car park at the northern end of the woods at postcode DG5 4QX. From here pick up trails heading east to visit the pretty Plantain Loch. On the way look out for red squirrels in the trees and grey herons around the water. For cyclists there are some great seperate mountain bike trails to try. It's renowned for the challenging granite slabs and a fine single track, technical section as well as a good skills track. You can start off at the 7 stanes Dalbeattie car park at postcode DG5 4QU.",
