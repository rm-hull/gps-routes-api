  "description": "These pretty bluebell woods in Milton Keynes have some nice shady trails, ponds and lots of wildlife to look out for. The walk also includes a visit to the small 16th century church of St Giles which is located next to the woods in Tattenhoe. You can start off from the car park and visitor centre off Chaffron Way. There's a wide variety of trees and shrubs, and almost three hundred species of moths have been recorded. You may spot deers, badgers, foxes and birds including Green Woodpecker, Greater Spotted Woodpecker, Tree Creeper, Willow Tit, Willow Warbler and the Sparrowhawk and Tawny Owl. Also look out for butterflies including White Admiral, the Wood White, Purple Hairstreak and the rare Black Hairstreak. After exploring the woods head west to visit St Giles Church which dates from 1538. It was constructed using the stones from nearby Snelshall Priory and also includes 800 year old yew trees in the churchyard. The Milton Keynes Boundary Walk and the North Bucks Way both past the western side of the woods. You can pick up these long distance footpaths to explore the countryside surrounding Milton Keynes. Also nearby is Furzton Lake where there's a nice cycling and walking trail to follow around the water.",

You are requested to please keep them on leads during bird nesting season which runs from March to September.

There's a fine 17th century pub and a significant aqueduct to see here. On the eastern side of Milton Keynes there's Newport Pagnell to explore. There's some lovely riverside trails, a fine local park and several historic buildings to see in this nearby town. The town is well known for being the original home of the exclusive sports car manufacturer Aston Martin. There's also a Grade I listed iron bridge dating from the early 19th century to see here. Just to the east you'll find Bletchley Park and its fascinating museum. This historic site is world famous as the location of the crucial Allied code-breaking during World War II. The park is also a nice place for a stroll with some pleasant gardens and an ornamental lake. For more walking ideas in the area see the Bedfordshire Walks page."
