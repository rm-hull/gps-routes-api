  "description": "These pretty bluebell woods in Milton Keynes have some nice shady trails, ponds and lots of wildlife to look out for. The walk also includes a visit to the small 16th century church of St Giles which is located next to the woods in Tattenhoe. You can start off from the car park and visitor centre off Chaffron Way. There's a wide variety of trees and shrubs, and almost three hundred species of moths have been recorded. You may spot deers, badgers, foxes and birds including Green Woodpecker, Greater Spotted Woodpecker, Tree Creeper, Willow Tit, Willow Warbler and the Sparrowhawk and Tawny Owl. Also look out for butterflies including White Admiral, the Wood White, Purple Hairstreak and the rare Black Hairstreak. After exploring the woods head west to visit St Giles Church which dates from 1538. It was constructed using the stones from nearby Snelshall Priory and also includes 800 year old yew trees in the churchyard. The Milton Keynes Boundary Walk and the North Bucks Way both past the western side of the woods. You can pick up these long distance footpaths to explore the countryside surrounding Milton Keynes. Also nearby is Furzton Lake where there's a nice cycling and walking trail to follow around the water.",
