  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Cantref Reservoir in the Brecon Beacons near Merthyr Tydfil. The walk starts from the car park at Beacons Reservoir just to the north of the reservoir. From here you can follow the Taff Trail south to the site. At the southern end of the reservoir there's a footpath branching off to the north east which will take you right along the lake on the dam. There's fine views here across the water to the surrounding forest and hills. After taking in the views from the dam you return to the car park on the same paths.",
