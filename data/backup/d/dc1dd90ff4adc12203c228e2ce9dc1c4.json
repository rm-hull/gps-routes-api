  "description": "This Norfolk Broads based village sits in a lovely spot near Womack Water and the\u00a0River Thurne. In the historic settlement you'll find\u00a0chocolate box thatched houses and the impressive 14th\u00a0Century St Catherine\u2019s Church. This circular river walk takes you to neighbouring Potter Heigham on a series of public footpaths before returning through the countryside on a quiet country lane. On the way you'll enjoy paths along the River Thurne and a visit to a number of pretty broads. The walk starts in the village public car park and follows footpaths south to Horse Fen and Womack Water Mill on the River Thurne. You then head east along the river to Potter Heigham Bridge where you can see the ancient medieval stone bridge and pick up boat trips. In Potter Heigham you pick up a section of the Weavers' Way , long distance trail. Follow the waymarked path east to Candle Dyke where the trail takes you past a series of broads including the expansive Hickling Broad . The trail then takes you through Potter Heigham village before follownig a country lane west back to Ludham.",
