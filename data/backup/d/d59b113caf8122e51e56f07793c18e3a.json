  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Wreay Woods near Carlisle in Cumbria. The scenic woods are something of a hidden gem and a nice place for an easy nature walk near the city. The walk starts in the little village of Wreay and follows footpaths east to visit the woods. Here you can pick up a nice riverside footpath heading north along the River Petteril towards Newbiggin Wood and Carleton. It's a lovely peaceful place with countryside views, bridges over the river and old mills to see. The area is also classed as a nature reserve so look out for a variety of flora and fauna as you make your way across the path. Keep your eyes peeled for kingfisher, dippers and even otters by the river. In the spring there are also pretty bluebells in the woods to admire.",
