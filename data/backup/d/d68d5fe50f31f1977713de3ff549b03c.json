  "description": "This pretty reservoir is located just to the south east of Loughborough. The Leicestershire Round long distance trail runs along the north eastern side of the water. You can follow the trail from the nearby village of Woodhouse Eaves to the water. It's about a one mile walk through farmland to the Aqueduct and Boat House at the reservoir's northern tip. It's a very pretty spot with nice views across the water to the surrounding woodland and countryside. Also look out for the steam trains of the Great Central Railway passing over Swithland Viaduct. The reservoir is popular with bird watchers with lots of water loving visitors to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for Great Crested Grebe and Mandarin Ducks on the water. Above the lake you can look out for Peregrines in the winter months. To extend your walk you can explore Charnwood Forest on our circular walk and visit the nearby Bradgate Country Park and Beacon Hill Country Park. These two lovely parks are located very close to start point for this route at Woodhouse Eaves. They both have good walking trails with climbs to great viewpoints which provide extensive views over this pretty area.",
