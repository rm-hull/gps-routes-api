  "description": "This pretty reservoir is located just to the south east of Loughborough. The Leicestershire Round long distance trail runs along the north eastern side of the water. You can follow the trail from the nearby village of Woodhouse Eaves to the water. It's about a one mile walk through farmland to the Aqueduct and Boat House at the reservoir's northern tip. It's a very pretty spot with nice views across the water to the surrounding woodland and countryside. Also look out for the steam trains of the Great Central Railway passing over Swithland Viaduct. The reservoir is popular with bird watchers with lots of water loving visitors to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for Great Crested Grebe and Mandarin Ducks on the water. Above the lake you can look out for Peregrines in the winter months. To extend your walk you can explore Charnwood Forest on our circular walk and visit the nearby Bradgate Country Park and Beacon Hill Country Park. These two lovely parks are located very close to start point for this route at Woodhouse Eaves. They both have good walking trails with climbs to great viewpoints which provide extensive views over this pretty area.",

Just to the south of the wood there are more nice waterside trails around Cropston Reservoir. Just to the north of the site there's the pretty village of Barrow upon Soar. There's some nice walks along the Grand Union Canal and a fine waterside pub to visit here. Just to the south of Bradgate Park you'll find the secluded Groby Pool. The small lake is a good place for wildlife watching and also includes some adjacent bluebell woods. The woodland trust's Martinshaw Wood is located about half a mile south west from here too. It's another peaceful local place for bird watching and easy trails. The National Forest Way passes through the area. The long distance trail takes you to several of the highlights of the National Forest area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks page."
