  "description": "This 7 mile walk in the capital visits four splendid London parks. The lovely trail is dedicated to the memory of Diana, Princess of Wales who had strong associations with many of the sites on the walk. These include buildings such as Kensington Palace, Spencer House, Buckingham Palace, St. James's Palace, and Clarence House. The trail passes through Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park and St James's Park on a series of well laid out, surfaced footpaths. The paths are waymarked with ninety individual plaques, each of which has a heraldic rose etched in the centre. It's a wonderful way to explore several of London's best parks in an afternoon. Highlights on the walk include the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, the beautiful Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park and views of Big Ben and the London Eye from Blue Bridge in St James Park. Also look out for the famous Pelicans in this area. The walk is in a figure of eight pattern so you could start and finish from any number of places. Hyde Park Corner, St James's Park Tube, Green Park Tube or the Serpentine car park in Kensington Gardens are all good options. If you would like to extend your walk then you could pick up the Jubilee Greenway in Kensington Gardens and head north to Little Venice where you could follow the Regent's Canal to Regent's Park. At St James's Park you are very close to the River Thames where you could pick up the Thames Path and enjoy a riverside walk to the Houses of Parliament. You can virtually explore the parks using the google street view link below!",

      "content": "For cyclists Cycle Superhighway 3 passes through this area. The popular trail runs from Lancaster Gate to Greatfields Park in Barking, passing several of the city's highlights on the way. You could follow it around Hyde Park where there are some lovely traffic free paths to follow. Just west of Kensington Gardens there's Holland Park to explore. The historic park was formerly the grounds of a Jacobean mansion called Holland House. It's well worth a visit with beautiful gardens, wildlife rich woodland, a stunning Japanese garden with waterfalls and a nice cafe for refreshments."
