  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along the River Roe in this country park near Limavady. You can start your walk from the visitor centre next to the ornamental lake. The footpaths then follow the River Roe which meanders pleasantly through the park. Along the way there are pretty waterfalls, spectacular gorges and attractive woodland. In the warmer months the park is covered with pretty wildlflowers. You can learn about the area's interesting industrial heritage in the museum and visit the remains of industrial buildings and the restored water wheel. National Cycle Network Route 93 runs past the park so you could pick it up from Limavady and head south to visit by bike.",
