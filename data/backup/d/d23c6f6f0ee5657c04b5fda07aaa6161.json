  "description": "Just above the little village of Askrigg in Wensleydale there is a lovely walking trail along a river with a series of pretty waterfalls and peaceful woodland. This walk starts in the village and follows the footpath to Mill Gill Force and Whitfield Force falls before returning through some beautiful Yorkshire Dales countryside. It's a really pleasant area with good signed paths, the sound of the running water and nice shady woodland. The long distance Herriot Way runs through the village. It takes you through areas of the Yorkshire Dales associated with the vet and author James Herriot. You can pick it up to extend your walking in this lovely area.",
