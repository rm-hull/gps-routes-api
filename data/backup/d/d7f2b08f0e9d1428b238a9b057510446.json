  "description": "This Derbyshire based village is in a lovely spot for riverside walks and Peak District climbs. It's a pretty place with old stone cottages, historic mills and a photogenic weir on the river. There's also good facilities including a craft centre, garden centre, local  shop, garage, and two pubs for refreshments after your exercise. Calver sits on the western side of the River Derwent, just below the popular peaks at Curbar Edge and Froggatt Edge . This circular walk from the village takes you along the river and up to these splendid ridge top trails with some wonderful views over the surrounding Peak District scenery. Starting in the village you head east, crossing the river and following a country lane past Curbar to Curbar Edge. Here you can enjoy some splendid rock formations and glorious views over the Eastern Moors of the Peak District. Follow the ridge north and it will take you to Froggatt Edge where there's another impressive gritstone escarpment, woodland and wildlife to see. Near the Grouse Inn you turn west through Hay Wood to descend to the river where you pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way . Follow the riverside waymarked footpath south and it will take you along Spooner Lane before returning you to Calver.",
