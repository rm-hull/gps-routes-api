In 1896 10,000 people marched from Bolton to the open countryside in a mass demonstration after the owner of the Smithills Hall estate, Colonel Richard Henry Ainsworth tried to stop public access, the demonstrators repeated the march the following week and were met with no opposition to them accessing the moors, it is considered an early forerunner of the Kinder Scout mass trespass. The demonstration is commemorated by a memorial stone on Coal Pit Lane, below Smithills Moor."

  "description": "Enjoy a walk to Winter Hill on the West Pennine Moors in Lancashire. The walk begins in Rivington Country Park and takes you to the 1,496 feet (456 m) high summit on a series of footpaths. After leaving the country park you ascend crossing Rivington Moor with fine views of Rivington Reservoir and Anglezarke Reservoir. You continue towards the village of Belmont where there is the opportunity for a short detour to the pretty Belmont Reservoir. After leaving Belmont you ascend towards the summit of the hill where you will see the Winter Hill TV Mast. From here there are fabulous views towards Greater Manchester, Blackpool Tower, Jodrell Bank Observatory, Snaefell in the Isle of Man and the Lake District mountains. The descent takes you to Crooked Edge Hill and Horwich before returning to the country park. To continue your walking in the area try the climb to the nearby Rivington Pike. It's another very popular hike with an ascent through the old Lever Park terraced gardens and more great views from the summit.",

It has a fine interior with cosy snugs, raised areas, coal fires and traditional features. At the back of the pub there\u2019s a sun-trap beer garden and part-covered courtyard. It's an ideal place to relax in after your walk if the weather is good. They also provide accommodation if you need to stay over in the area.
