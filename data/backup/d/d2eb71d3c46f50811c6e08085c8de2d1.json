  "description": "This historic market town is located in Worcestershire, on the River Avon. It's a fine place to explore on foot with several medieval timber framed buildings, riverside parks and an ancient abbey to see. The town also sits close to the edge of the Cotswolds where there are numerous walking opportunities. This circular riverside walk in the town takes you around Abbey Park before crossing to the other side to explore Workman Gardens. It uses part of Shakespeare's Avon Way, a waymarked long distance trail which passes through the town. You can start the walk from the car park in Abbey Park on the northern side of the river. The park includes a natural terrace, picturesque lily pond and lovely gardens. At the northern end of the park you can cross the river on Workman Bridge to explore Workman Gardens. To continue your walking in the town head north along the river to visit Evesham Country Park. There's wide lawns, orchards, and a lake in this lovely local park. Scroll down for a full list of walks near and around Evesham.",
