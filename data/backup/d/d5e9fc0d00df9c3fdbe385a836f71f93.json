The building, of cruciform plan and with many decorative religious devices, was never completed after his death in 1605. The snail mount on the left and moat were all part of his elaborate design for a typical Elizabethan garden, including the orchard shown in other views within this square."

This new orchard was re-planted from 2002 by the National Trust with the help of private sponsors. Also visible in this view is the roofline of Lyveden Old Bield."

  "description": "This fine long distance path explores the woodland and country trails around Fermyn Woods in Northamptonshire. It runs for just under 10 miles on a series of fairly flat public footpaths. Start the walk from the car park at Fermyn Woods and then follow the trails east along the edge of the Tresham Coppice. The route continues south east to Assart's Coppice and then through Lady Wood and Souther Wood where you emerge into the countryside. Continue heading east and you will soon come to the River Nene and the village of Wadenhoe. It's a very pretty little village with old cottages and mills next to the river. At the village you turn around and head north west to Wadenhoe Wood and Lilford Wood before coming to Lyveden itself. This fine National Trust property includes an Elizabethan lodge and moated garden. Work on the mansion stopped in 1605 and it has remained in its incomplete state since then. Highlights include the picturesque moat and the Elizabethan orchard. There is an audio tour where you can find out about the Trensham family who built the home. It's an interesting story as they were involved with the Gunpowder Plot. The final section takes you west from the house to pick up the paths back through Fermyn Woods to the car park.",
