  "description": "This circular walk from Ambleside visits some of the highlights of the area including Stock Ghyll Force Waterfall, Wansfell Pike, Jenkin's Crag, Stagshaw Gardens, Lake Windermere, Ambleside Roman Fort, the River Rothay and Rothay Park. It's a varied 4.5 mile walk with some moderate climbs and fabulous views throughout. The walk starts in Ambleside town centre, following a road up to a wooded valley with a series of pretty waterfalls. After emerging from the valley you follow trails east up to Wansfell Pike. From the 482 metre peak there are stunning views of the Coniston Fells, Fairfield, Lake Windermere and Red Screes. The route then descends south to Jenkin's Crag and Skelghyll Wood. Here you will find the pretty Stagshaw Gardens which are owned by the National Trust. The garden is noted for its shrubs, including rhododendrons, azaleas and camellias. There are also nice views over Windermere Lake to enjoy from the elevated garden. The walk then descends to the lakeside at Waterhead where you can boats to Bowness. You pass the piers before heading through Borrans Park to the Ambleside Roman Fort. The fort is Grade I listed and dates from the 1st or 2nd century. It was probably built under Hadrian's rule to guard the Roman road from Brougham to Ravenglass. The route then heads north to follow some lovely waterside paths along the River Rothay to Rothay Park. Heading east through the attractive park will take you past the church and back into the town.",
