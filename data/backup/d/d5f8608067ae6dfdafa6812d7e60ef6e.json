  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Naburn Locks on the River Ouse, just south of the city of York. It's a lovely place for a stroll with riverside paths, a nature trail and a sensory garden. The area is good for wildlife so look out for red kites, kingfishers and herons as you make your way along the waterside paths. The site also includes the heritage buildings such as the forge, workshop, and the lock keeper\u2019s cottage. The area has an interesting history with the original lock and weir combination built in the 1750s. At the time it was one of the most impressive feats of canal enginerring in the country. In Victorian times a larger lock was opened by Queen Victoria's grandson with a splendid opening ceremony. The locks were once busy with barges transporting goods to and from York and Hull.",
