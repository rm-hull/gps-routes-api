  "description": "A waterside walk along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal from Crickhowell to Llangynidr. The route runs for about 5.5 miles along the towpath with a shady section at the start before nice views over the surrounding hills and countryside as you approach Llangynidr. The walk starts in the centre of Crickhowell and crosses the River Usk before following country lanes to the canal at the village of Llangattock . You then head north west past Dandy and Glanusk Park on a tree lined section of the canal. The route finishes at the village of Llangynidr where there's five locks and an aqueduct nearby. There's also a Grade I listed stone bridge over the River Usk which dates from 1700. If you continue west along the canal you will soon come to Talybont Reservoir . There's some lovely trails around the water and throug Talybont Forest to enjoy here. To continue your walking in the town try the Crickhowell River Walk which takes you along the River Usk. You could also enjoy a climb to Table Mountain and Pen Cerrig Calch on the epic Cambrian Way .",
