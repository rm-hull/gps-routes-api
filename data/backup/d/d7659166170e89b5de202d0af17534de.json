  "description": "Climb to the highest point in Leicestershire on this walk near Coalville. The hill is located just a couple of miles east of Coalville town centre. A good start point for the walk is the village of Whitwick just to the north of the hill. From here you can follow the Ivanhoe Way long distance trail to the hill. It's about a 2.5 mile walk from the village to the 912 feet (278 m) high hill summit where you will find a radio mast and wonderful views over the Charnwood Forest and the extensive Bardon Hill quarry below. On a clear day you can see as far as the Malvern Hills, the Shropshire Hills and the Peak District. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the Charnwood Forest circular walk which runs past the hill. Following it south will take you to the village of Markfield which is an alternative start point for visiting the hill.",
