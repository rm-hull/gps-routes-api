  "description": "This short circular walk visits the picturesque Willsbridge Mill on the Siston Brook in Bristol. The Grade II listed mill dates back to 1712 and was used to grind flour and corn. Today there is a Heritage Museum where you can learn all about the history of the mill. There's also a gift shop and a nice cafe for refreshments afterwards. There's nice walking trails on both sides of the brook with peaceful woodland, meadows, ponds and a wildlife garden to see as well. The area is part of the Willsbridge Valley Nature Reserve where you can see flora such as bluebells and red campion. There's also lots of wildlife with badgers and foxes to see in the woodland and dragonflies and frogs to look out for around the ponds. Birdlife includes dippers and kingfishers along the streams. On the southern side the footpaths run along the old Gloucester and Avon Tramway. You can start the walk from the small car park at the site and then pick up the brookside trails heading east.",

    {
      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "You can extend the walk by picking up the River Avon Trail and enjoy a riverside walk along the Avon which runs just past the site. A few miles north east of the mill there's a bit of a hidden gem at Wick Quarry. The quarry is now a popular place for walkers with the surrounding Golden Valley Nature Reserve great for wildlife and views of the River Boyd. The town of Keynsham and the Avon Valley Country Park lie a short distance to the south. Just over a mile to the west there's Hanham Woods and Conham River Park to explore. The two adjacent sites form part of the wider Avon Valley Woodlands Nature Reserve. For more walks in the county see the Somerset Walks page."
