  "description": "This small Shropshire village is nestled in splendid spot within the Long Mynd and Stiperstones AONB. It's a pretty place located on both the River East Onny and the Darnford Brook. There's several waymarked footpaths to explore the area and a fine old pub to relax in afterwards too. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Shropshire Way to visit Pole Bank at the summit of the Long Mynd. Start the walk from the village and follow the waymarked Shropshire Way north east past Ratlinghope Hill to the Betchcott Hills. The route then turns south east to meet up with the Long Mynd around Duckley Nap. Here you can follow the wonderful ridge top trail south west to Pole Bank and enjoy glorious views over the surrounding Shropshire Hills. The route then heads west to Stanbatch and Adstone Hill where you turn north to Onny Bank Farm and Ratlinghope.",
