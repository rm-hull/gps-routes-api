  "description": "This 198 acre reservoir and nature reserve has a lovely waterside walking path ideal for an easy stroll.  The walk starts at the parking lot at the southern end of the reservoir and take you along the eastern side of the water to the village of Balcombe before returning to the start point. As a nature reserve you will pass through a variety of habitats including wetland, reedbed, deciduous woodland, hazel coppice and haymeadow. Look out for Great crested grebe and kingfishers as you make your way round the reservoir. Our Ouse Valley Viaduct Walk also starts from the same car park. It is a short walk along the river to the impressive structure which is a highlight of the area. Ardingly is located near Haywards Heath in West Sussex. It is right next to the stunning Wakehurst Place which has beautiful gardens and is a great option if you'd like to continue your walking. Alternatively the High Weald Landscape Trail can also be picked up from the edge of Wakehurst Place.",
