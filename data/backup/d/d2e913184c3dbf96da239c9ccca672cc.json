A corrie like this would be ideal for stashing other people's cattle, or hiding your own, a use to which it was probably put."

  "description": "This challenging walk climbs the popular mountain of Ben Venue in the Trossachs. There's fabulous views over the surrounding mountains, lochs and forestry from the high points. The route starts from the Ben Venue car park off the A821 at the western end of Loch Achray . From here you can pick up woodland trails along Achray Water to Gleann Riabhach. As you ascend the mountain you can enjoy wonderful views back down to the huge Loch Katrine and Loch Venachar. There's also far reaching views of the area's other mountains, particularly Ben Lomond .  At the 729\u00a0m (2,392\u00a0ft) summit you can see as far as the Firth of Forth, the Isle of Arran and the\u00a0Paps of Jura on a clear day. See the drone footage video below to appreciate the majestic surroundings. The mountain sits in the wonderful Queen Elizabeth Forest Park where there are miles of other cycling and walking trails to try. For example you can extend your exercise by following the wonderful cycle and walking path along the northern side of Loch Katrine . Glen Finglas is also nearby. Here you can enjoy woodland trails, open heathland, rushing streams, waterfalls and challenging hill climbs.",
