  "description": "This is a short but popular walk from Seaton to the nearby village of Beer. It follows a lovely section of the South West Coast Path for about 1.5 miles with a moderate climb as you approach Beer. There's lovely views over Seaton Bay, gorgeous beaches, views of the Devon countryside and some good cafes in Beer for refreshments at the end of the walk. The walk starts on the seafront in Seaton and takes you along the pretty beach before a short climb to Beer. You can return the same way or catch the bus back. To extend the walk you can continue to Branscombe on the Branscombe to Beer Walk. To further explore the wonderful Jurassic Coast you can try the longer Sidmouth to Beer Walk which runs for about 8 miles along an undulating path.",
