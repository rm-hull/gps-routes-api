      "caption": "Kings Langley, Site of the former Royal Palace. The former Royal Palace at Kings Langley was built under the supervision of Eleanor of Castile (1241 - 1290), wife of King Edward I. It appears to have been started around 1276 and to have been completed by 1299. This is how the village of Langley got its epithet Kings. Edmund de Langley, the first Duke of York and fifth son of King Edward III, was born here in 1341. Around 1349, during the outbreak of plague, known as the Black Death, King Edward III used the Royal Palace as his seat of government away from London. The Palace seems to have fallen into disuse during the Wars of the Roses, and was demolished around 1469. Apart from occasional underground finds during construction works for the nearby\u00a0Rudolf Steiner school nothing remains of the former structure. The Ordnance Survey 1:10,000 scale map shows the centre of the site to be in the rear gardens of the houses in the photograph, probably the second house from the right being where the actual symbol is. This photograph was taken from the footpath leading south."

  "description": "This attractive Hertfordshire based village has some nice canal and country trails to try. The settlement is also close to the Chilterns where there are numerous walking routes available. This circular walk from the village visits Kings Langley Common and a particularly lovely section of the Grand Union Canal which runs past the eastern side of the village. The walk starts on the green space on the common and then heads east through the village to link up with the canal. You can follow the towpath south passing weirs, locks and a small fishing lake. The route then heads west along part of the Hertfordshire Way and then north to pass the site of the former Royal Palace and the Rudolf Steiner School. From here it is a short strol back to the common where the walk finishes. The route passes very close to Kings Langley train station at its south eastern tip. This could make an alternative start point if you are coming by public transport.",
