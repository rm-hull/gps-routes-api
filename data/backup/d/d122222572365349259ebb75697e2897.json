But first it has to turn around in order to be headed in the right direction and a shrill horn is sounded to warn other boats of the impending obstacle. Being able to reverse upstream into the wide bend in the river gives more room to manoeuvre and is presumably the main reason why the cruiser is moored at this location. The Southern Comfort is a paddle steamer that was purpose built for the Broads; the luxury river cruiser has a capacity of 100 passengers for public trips or private hire and runs regular trips from Horning, along the River Bure, to Ranworth Broad and back."

  "description": "This Norfolk Broads village has some lovely waterside walks along the River Bure and the surrounding broads. It's one of the finest Broads villages with waterside pubs, shops, restaurant, tea-rooms and boat trips making it very popular with tourists. This walk from the village takes you to the Horning Ferry before heading to Bure Marshes, Woodbastwick and Salhouse Broad . Look out for lots of water loving birds as you make your way along the waterways of this lovely area. The walk starts by heading through the village towards Horning Ferry, just to the south east. Here you'll find a fine riverside pub and a ferry service to take you across the River Bure. Check the website for running times. The route then takes a small detour to visit the boardwalk which runs along the Cockshoot Dike to Cockshoot Broad. You then head through Bure Marshes before following Ferry Road to Woodbastwick. From here follow Salhouse Road west before picking up a footpath heading north to the pretty Salhouse Broad.",
