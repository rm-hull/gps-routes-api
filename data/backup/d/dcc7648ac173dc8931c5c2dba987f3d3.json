  "description": "Enjoy peaceful lakeside walking and cycling in this delightful country park in Northumberland. Bolam lake is located less than 10 miles from Morpeth in the heart of the Northumberland countryside. There are woodland paths, grassland and a super visitor centre with cafe, shop and information area. Cyclists please keep to the marked bridleway and give way to walkers. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head a few miles north to Hartburn Glebe where there are peaceful woodland trails, a pretty river and a variety of wildlife to look out for. Another good option is to climb to the nearby Shaftoe Crags. The crags are located just a mile west of the park and include interesting rock formations and wonderful views over the Northumberland countryside. A short distance to the north west of the crags you will find the National Trust's Wallington Hall where there's lakes, woodland, parkland and a beautiful walled garden.",
