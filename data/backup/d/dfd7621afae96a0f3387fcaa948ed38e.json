  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle along the beautiful Loch Ard, near Aberfoyle in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. This circular route starts in the car park at the eastern end of the loch and takes you along the loch and through the surrounding woodland on good paths. On the way there are lovely view points with picnic benches where you can sit and admire the view over Loch Ard to the forests and surrounding hills. The route also passes a number of interesting sculptures with riddles and the pretty Lochan Ghleannain. You can easily extend your outing by continuing west along the miles of cycle and walking trails in the Loch Ard Forest. The Forestry Commision have created a number of fine waymarked trails to try including the Ben Lomond Viewpoint Trail and the Loch Ard Sculpture Trail. There are also great cycling and walking trails to Loch Katrine, Loch Achray and Loch Venachar and Loch Drunkie .",
