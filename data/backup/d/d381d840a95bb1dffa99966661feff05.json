  "description": "This walk climbs to Pendle Hill from the village of Sabden in Lancashire. The village is located a few miles south west of the hill summit and makes for an alternative start point to the Pendle Hill walk from Barley . It's about a 3 mile walk from the village so roughly 6 miles there and back. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north, passing Calf Hill and Churn Clough Reservoir. You continue past Badgers Well Water and Chartist's Well where you turn north east to Badgers Well Hill. The route continues past Black Hill, Pendle Moor and Ogden Clough before coming to the hill summit which stands at a height of 557 metres (1,827\u00a0ft). From here there are wonderful views over the South Pennines\u00a0to the east, the\u00a0Bowland Fells\u00a0to the northwest, and the\u00a0West Pennine Moors to the south. This walk starts from the village but you could also start from the Nick of Pendle car park\u00a0which is located just to the north west of the village.",
