  "description": "A circular walk from Morston, visiting the neighbouring villages of Stiffkey and Cockthorpe. On the way there's splendid views of the Norfolk Coast and the wildlife at Stiffkey Marshes. There's also nice views of the River Stiffkey and some lovely countryside around Cockthorpe on the inland section. Start the walk from the public car park at the attractive Morston Quay, a couple of miles west of Blakeney. From here you can pick up the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path and follow the National Trail west along Morston Greens and Sitffkey Marshes. At Stiffkey Greens you can follow a footpath south into the village of Stiffkey. After exploring the village the route doubles back to return to the coast. Head east and then at the lake follow a path south and then west along the Morston Road. Another path branches off to the south to take you towards Cockthorpe Common. From Cockthorpe you can follow country trails north east to return to Morston.",

The Blakeney Circular Walk, Blakeney Point Nature Reserve and Blakeney to Cley Walk all start from the village and explore the beautiful area on a series of good footpaths. To the south there's some interesting local history at Binham Priory. Here you can explore substantial monastic ruins dating back to the 11th century."
