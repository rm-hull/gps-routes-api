  "description": "This attractive village in Cheshire includes a conservation area with a number of historic properties including an early 16th century church overlooking the pretty village green. There's some nice waterside walks along the local canal and views of the River Weaver which also runs through the area. This circular walk from the village takes you along the Llangollen Canal to Wrenbury Heath before following a section of the South Cheshire Way through the countryside. The walk starts in the village and heads north to the canal where you will find Wrenbury Lift Bridge, the canal basin and the old mill which is now a pub. Follow the towpath east and it will take you to Starkey's Bridge and Wrenbury Heath. Here you leave the canal and head south towards Aston where you pick up the South Cheshire Way. Follow the waymarked footpath west and it will take you past Wrenbury train station to Smeaton Hall. Turn north west here and the country lane will take you back over the River Weaver to return to the village centre.",
