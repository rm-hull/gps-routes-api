  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll across the Lavington and Duncton Commons on this easy walk near Midhurst in West Sussex. There's miles of good footpaths taking you across attractive heathland and woodland. It's a great place for wildlife with woodlark, nightjar, tree pipits, stonechat and reptiles including the rare sand lizard. The site also includes Merlin's Wood with its tunnel of rhododendrons. You can pick up the trails from the car park on Duncton Common Road. Heading west will take you across Lavington Common while heading east takes you across Duncton Common where there are more woodland trails and a pretty stream. The Serpent Trail long distance footpath runs across the common so it's easy to extend your walk. If you head west the trail will take you to Iping Common and Stedham Common where there are more nice heathland trails and a large pond. The South Downs Way passes across Graffham Down just a mile to the south of the common.",

The Grade II-listed traditional country pub, constructed in 1609 and later expanded during the Victorian era, is a charming destination. It features a beautiful garden and a striking inglenook fireplace that becomes a cosy spot with blazing logs in the winter. Its popularity is further enhanced by its location near the South Downs Way and other scenic walking areas. You can find them at postcode GU28 0QA. The pub is dog friendly. The village is also a nice place for a stroll with pretty cottages and a notable 13th-century church to see."
