  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll across the Lavington and Duncton Commons on this easy walk near Midhurst in West Sussex. There's miles of good footpaths taking you across attractive heathland and woodland. It's a great place for wildlife with woodlark, nightjar, tree pipits, stonechat and reptiles including the rare sand lizard. The site also includes Merlin's Wood with its tunnel of rhododendrons.  You can pick up the trails from the car park on Duncton Common Road. Heading west will take you across Lavington Common while heading east takes you across Duncton Common where there are more woodland trails and a pretty stream. The Serpent Trail long distance footpath runs across the common so it's easy to extend your walk. If you head west the trail will take you to Iping Common and Stedham Common where there are more nice heathland trails and a large pond. The South Downs Way passes across Graffham Down just a mile to the south of the common.",
