  "description": "This walk visits the splendid Hartland Moor National Nature Reserve near Wareham in Dorset. It follows the Hartland Way and Poole Harbour Trail around the woodland and heathland. It's a peaceful and attractive area with a number of bird hides where you can look out for the wide variety of birdlife which visit the heath. Look out for osprey, hen harriers, hobbies, woodlark, stonechats, meadow pipits and avocets from the hide at Middlebere Lake. There's also great views to the nearby Middlebere Heath and Corfe Castle. You can start the walk from the roadside parking near Middlebere Farm. The area has strong associations with the Wessex of Thomas Hardy Novels. The fictional Egdon Heath, setting for The Return of the Native, is based on the area. You can extend your walking in the area by visiting Arne Nature Reserve which is a couple of miles to the north of Hartland Moor. Just to the south you can enjoy a walk around Corfe Castle and Corfe Common. You can also pick up the The Hardy Way here and further explore the Purbecks.",
