In the estate you'll find lovely formal gardens and woodland trails through My Lady's Wood and Home Covert. Look out for water loving wildlife by the pretty stream in My Lady's Wood. To continue your walking in the area head to the delightful Lynford Arboretum. Located near Mundford the site has a number of waymarked footpaths, taking you to pretty lakes and a wide variety of tree species. The arboretum lies on the edge of Thetford Forest where there are miles of trails to try.",
