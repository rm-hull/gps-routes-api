  "description": "This walk was created by Telford & Wrekin council as a millennium project and named after late former Chief Executive of the council David Hutchison. It runs from Wellington to Newport via Telford and passes through woodland, country parks and some lovely Shropshire countryside. Walk highlights include splendid views of The Wrekin in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This prominent landmark forms a beautiful backdrop for much of the walk. You will also visit the Ercall with its small hill, quarries and wood. The area is full of flora and fauna and is regarded as an internationally important geological site. At Donnington wood you will pass through Granville Country Park. Here you will find a variety of plantlife including Orchids, ox-eye daisy and cowslips.",
