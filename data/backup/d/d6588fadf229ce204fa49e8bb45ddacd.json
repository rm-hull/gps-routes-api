  "description": "This walk visits the Whiteadder Reservoir in the Lammermuir Hills of East Lothian. The picturesque and remote reservoir is a very peaceful place for a stroll with few visitors. At the south eastern end of the site there's good views of the dam and the Whiteadder River which feeds into the reservoir. The area is great for wildlife spotting with Ospreys, Cuckoos, Barn Owls, Red Grouse and Adders to look out for too. At the northern end you could also take a hike up to the ruins of Gamelshiel Castle which dates back to the 16th century.",

Near here the Coldingham Bay to St Abbs and Coldingham Loch Walk will take you on to the pretty Coldingham Loch and into the village of the same name. Just west of St Abbs Head you'll find the historic Fast Castle. The photogenic ruins of the 14th century structure are located in a fine spot on a rocky headland overlooking the sea. To the north there's the popular Gullane to North Berwick Walk to try. To the east there's Edin's Hall Broch. Here you can explore the historic remains of a 2nd century broch while enjoying some fine views over the area."
