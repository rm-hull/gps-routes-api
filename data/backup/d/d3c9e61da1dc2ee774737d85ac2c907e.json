The station was closed to passengers 16/6/47 when the regular branch service ceased, to goods 5/1/53. Although regular freight traffic to Wirksworth continued until 1/4/68, the line has survived and used for various purposes, having been operated since 2003 as the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway by WyvernRail plc (formed 1992). This explains the presence of the crossing-lights in 1998."

  "description": "A fine railway themed walk through the Ecclesbourne Valley from Duffield to Wirksworth. The walk runs along the River Ecclesbourne, following the route of the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway between the two stations. The finish point is Wirksworth station which is the headquarters of the splendid old heritage railway. The line is operated by a large fleet of heritage Diesel Multiple Units and some lovely old steam locomotives. The walk starts at Duffield train station and picks up a trail along the river heading north west towards Windley. The route continues north past Turnditch, Hillclifflane, Idridgehay, Gibbet Wood and Gorseybank before arriving in Wirksworth. On the way you'll pass a number of the old stations dotted along the line. You can stop here for a rest and enjoy watching the trains come in and out of the stations. There's also some attractive countryside and riverside paths to enjoy in the valley.",
