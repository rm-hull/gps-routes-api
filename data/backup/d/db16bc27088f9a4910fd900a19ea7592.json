  "description": "Explore 73 acres of parkland surrounding the Grade II listed stately mansion of Whitworth Hall in Spennymoor . You can hand feed the resident fallow deer, stroll around the ornamental lake and then follow the peaceful woodland walk. There is also a pretty Victorian garden containing England's most northerly vineyard. The Weardale Way walking route runs along the River Wear just to the north of the park. This waymarked long distance trail is a great option if you would like to continue your walking in the area.",
