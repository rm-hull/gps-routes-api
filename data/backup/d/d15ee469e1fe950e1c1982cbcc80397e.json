  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Holme Styes Reservoir near Holmfirth in Yorkshire. It's a lovely quiet spot and something of a hidden gem of the area. You can find the small lake just over 2 miles south of Holmfirth. On the eastern side of the water there's some roadside parking where you can start the walk. From here you can pick up a circular trail running around the reservoir, part of which uses the Kirklees Way .  You could head west along this waymarked footpath to explore the woodland to the west of the site.",
