Before the arrival of the Romans in the area, Norfolk and Suffolk were the home of the Iceni, who in AD 61 rebelled against Roman rule, led by their Queen Boudica. The revolt was suppressed and the town of Venta Icenorum was established in order to bring stability to the area."

A variety of wild flowers is growing on the sunny south wall which is covered by soil. The London to Norwich railway line can be seen in the distance. There are two signposted walks, one leading around the Roman defences, the other following the course of the River Tas. Just to the east of the site there is a Early Saxon cemetery, and on raised ground to the north both an Iron Age burial site and Saxon cemetery have been excavated. The Arminghall Henge is located to the north-east."

The name Boudica (often spelled 'Boadicea', which was the Victorian version or 'Boudicca', used by Tacitus) derives from the Celtic 'bouda' which means victory. Boudica was the wife of the Icenian king Prasutagus. When he died his kingdom was annexed by the Romans, Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped. In AD 60 or 61 Boudica led the Iceni, along with others, in revolt. They destroyed Camulodunum (Colchester) and the site of a temple to the former emperor Claudius. Boudica was defeated in the end and is reported by Tacitus to have poisoned herself. The site where she is buried is unknown."

Whilst flying at around 2,000 feet (600 m) he noticed cropmarks of a circular enclosure made of two concentric rings with a horseshoe of eight pit-like markings within it."

Crawford, who pronounced it to be the Norwich Woodhenge but it was not until 1935 that it was first excavated, by Grahame Clark. His work established that two circular rings were ditches, the outer one 1.5 m deep and the inner one 2.3 m deep, with indications of a bank that once stood between them. The pits in the middle were postholes for timbers that would have been almost 1 m in diameter. The site dates to the Neolithic, with a radiocarbon date of 3650-2650 Cal BC (4440\u00b1150) from charcoal from a post-pit. The henge is orientated on the mid-winter sunset, which, when viewed from the lication, sets down the slope of nearby high ground, Chapel Hill."

  "description": "Follow the Boudicca Way from Norwich to Diss on this walk through the beautiful, unspoilt South Norfolk landscape. The route runs for about 36 miles with some fascinating historical sites to see on the way. The walk also passes through a series of pretty villages including Shotesham , Saxlingham Nethergate and Pulham Market. There are also views of the rivers Yare and Tas to enjoy and a visit to the Venta Icenorum Roman town at Caistor St Edmund . The town was the capital of the Iceni tribe, who inhabited the flatlands and marshes of Norfolk and who revolted against Roman rule under their queen Boudicca (or Boadicea) in the winter of 61 CE. The walk is easily accessible, starting and finishing at mainline railway stations.",
