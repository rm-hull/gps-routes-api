Over the doorway there is a curious inscription, taken from Psalm 95: THE SEA IS HIS AND HE MADE IT: AND HIS HANDS PREPARED THE DRY LAND."

  "description": "This Grade I listed castle is located near Abergele in Conwy, Wales. The 19th century house is surrounded by an expansive estate with miles of peaceful woodland trails for walkers. The area also includes some beautiful gardens and the viewpoint at Cefn yr Ogof, which stands at a height of 204 metres. There are excellent views towards the coast from this elevated spot. Near here there's also an old stone folly where you can poke your head through the window and enjoy another fine view down to the beach below. The castle became famous in 2020 when it was used as the setting for the 20th series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!",

To continue your historical walking you could visit the nearby Bodelwyddan Castle. On the western side of the castle there's the small village of Rhyd y Foel where you can enjoy a climb to the Pen y Corddyn Mawr hill fort. There's more fine views over the River Dulas valley from this interesting ancient site."
