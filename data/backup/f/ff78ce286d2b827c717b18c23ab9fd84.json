  "description": "This walk visits the splendidly positioned Fast Castle on the Scottish Borders coast. There is a car park at Dowlaw where you can start your walk. From here you can pick up a path which steeply descends to the cliff top and the castle. The ruined structure dates back to the 1300s and is located on a rocky headland overlooking the sea. Here you can explore the fascinating ruins and enjoy some glorious views along the coast. Keep your eyes peeled for birds such as Shag and Cormorant on the rocks below. The castle is located just west of St Abbs Head Nature Reserve. The reserve is a great place to extend your walk with lots of sea birds and more fine coastal trails to try. You can reach the site by picking up the Berwickshire Coastal Path at the car park and following it east for a few miles.",

      "content": "The Eyemouth to St Abbs Walk will take you along the coast path to the headland from the nearby town. Eyemouth is well worth a visit, with its picturesque harbour and the historic Gunsgreen House to see. Head inland and there's some pleasant waterside trails along Whiteadder Reservoir in the Lammermuir Hills of East Lothian. Near here you can also visit Edin's Hall Broch where you can explore the historic remains of a 2nd century broch while enjoying some fine views over the area. The Coldingham Bay to St Abbs and Coldingham Loch Walk will take you on to the pretty Coldingham Loch and into the village of the same name."
