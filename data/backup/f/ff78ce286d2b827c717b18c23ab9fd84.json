  "description": "This walk visits the splendidly positioned Fast Castle on the Scottish Borders coast. There is a car park at Dowlaw where you can start your walk. From here you can pick up a path which steeply descends to the cliff top and the castle. The ruined structure dates back to the 1300s and is located on a rocky headland overlooking the sea. Here you can explore the fascinating ruins and enjoy some glorious views along the coast. Keep your eyes peeled for birds such as Shag and Cormorant on the rocks below. The castle is located just west of St Abbs Head Nature Reserve. The reserve is a great place to extend your walk with lots of sea birds and more fine coastal trails to try. You can reach the site by picking up the Berwickshire Coastal Path at the car park and following it east for a few miles.",
