  "description": "This Shropshire based market town sits close to the border with Staffordshire in\u00a0Telford and Wrekin. This walk in the town takes you along the now disused Newport Canal. There's a nice footpath running along the canal for just over a mile along the northern outskirts of the town. You can pick up the trail just to the west of the town centre at Windy Meadows Farm. Follow the trail east and it will take you past Victoria Park which is worth a small detour from the route. The park is a pleasant place for a stroll in the town with ducks and swans to feed on the water. The route then continues to Islington and Meretown but you can extend the outing by continuing east to visit the lovely Aqualate Mere . There's another pleasant waterside path to pick up at this large, scenic lake. The site is one of the area's highlights and notable as the largest natural lake in the\u00a0English Midlands. Also of note is the splendid Chetwynd Deer Park . The private 200 acre park hosts special events and can also be hired out. This lies just to the north of the canal and includes the pretty Park Pool where you can look out for a variety of birdlife.",
