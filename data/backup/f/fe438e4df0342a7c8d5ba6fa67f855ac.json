  "description": "This large area of common land is located just to the west of Leatherhead. It's a good place for walking with miles of trails taking you to grassland, ancient woodland and picturesque ponds. The common includes bridleways which are suitable for cyclists as well. It's a great place for wildlife too with nightingales, warblers and pretty butterflies in the summer months. There is a handy bird hide on the eastern side of the site, next to the ponds. There's an information board here detailing the birds you might see on the water. Keep your eyes peeled for little grebe and damselflies here. This walk starts from the National Trust car park at the southern end of the common. Very close by is Bookham train station so the common is very accessible by public transport. From here you can pick up the footpaths heading north west and then create a circular route through the area.",

You can also pick up the North Downs Way here and head east to the nearby Box Hill Country Park. Just south east you will find Norbury Park where there's some more woodland trails and walks along the River Mole on the Mole Gap Trail. A few miles to the north of the common there's Oxshott Heath and Woods to visit. The village is also notable as being one of the most expensive places to live in the country. Residents include several premier league footballers and tennis player Andy Murray. For more walking ideas in the area see the Surrey Hills Walks page."
