It's worth the time to visit, especially if you have visited the castle previously; are curious about the Druids; and like nature walks. Rock Close is to the east of the castle and accessible via an arch over the stream that passes under a road. It could take about an hour to leisurely walk the entire path."

Built in 1874 to welcome the return of the family after an absence of 54 years, Blarney House may surprise by being in the Scots baronial style, which is rare in the southern half of Ireland. Its architect was John Lanyon from Belfast. Typical of High Victorian buildings, Blarney House incorporates elements of several other styles. Its porch is neoclassical and comes from the Colthurst\u2019s house at Ardrum, a neighbouring estate."

  "description": "This walk visits a wonderful medieval castle in the town of Blarney in County Cork. The ancient castle dates to 1446 and is the site of the famous Blarney Stone. According to legend, kissing the stone endows the kisser with the gift of the gab (great eloquence or skill at flattery). The castle grounds are a great place for a walk with miles of trails taking you around attractive woodland with nature trails, beautiful gardens and pretty streams. There's also Blarney Lake and the Blarney River to see in this lovely area. To continue your walking in the area head south east to the coast where you can try the Crosshaven Cliff Walk. This fine circular walk provides wonderful views over Cork Harbour and visits the 16th century Camden Fort Meagher. You could also try the circular Cork Marina Walk where there's fine views over the River Lee and a visit to the 16th century Blackrock Castle.",

      "content": "Castle History: Constructed nearly 600 years ago by the formidable chieftain Cormac MacCarthy, Lord of Muskerry, famously known as \u201cThe Strong\u201d, Blarney retains its allure despite much of it being in ruins. Beneath the castle's main body, a network of subterranean passages from the Middle Ages exists, although most remain inaccessible. Visitors can still explore the eerie dungeon, once a prison for captives. Ascending from these depths, you can climb to the castle's battlements and savour panoramic views of the countryside. The tall watch tower adjacent to the castle remains vigilant over the Blarney estate. Despite its dilapidated state, Blarney Castle continues to captivate. While descending from the battlements, one can gaze into the roofless remains and envision its heyday \u2013 a bustling banqueting hall filled with medieval nobility and their attendants, a family room resplendent for its era, and the ominous murder hole, strategically designed to dispatch rocks or boiling water onto intruders. To the south of the castle there's some fine coastal walking at the Old Head of Kinsale Loop and Charles Fort. The National Monument of Ireland dates back to the 17th century and includes good footpaths to follow around the Bastions. There's also some excellent views over Kinsale harbour and exhibitions where you can learn all about the history of the area. To the north there's Mallow Castle which includes several historic buildings including a 16th-century fortified house, a 19th-century mansion, and the ruins of a 13th-century castle. There is also a deer park with rare white deer."
