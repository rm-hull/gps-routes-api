The peace of a glorious early-autumn day was shattered by a duck shoot just a few yards away; when the gun-shots were not booming, the poor ducks were flying noisily all over the shop. Perhaps the guns themselves were plutocratic guests from the nearby exclusive Littlecote House Hotel. This photograph was taken on the very northern edge of the gridsquare."

  "description": "This walk visits Littlecote House in Wiltshire. The historic Elizabethan country house dates back to the mid 1500s and is surrounded by beautiful grounds. The house is now run as a hotel where you can enjoy a delicious afternoon tea before strolling around the gardens and visiting the on site Roman settlement where you can see an ancient mosaic floor. There's also some interesting history as Henry VIII courted his third wife Jane Seymour at the house in the 16th century. The D-Day landings of the second world war were also planned within the house. This circular walk starts from the house and follows footpaths around Littlecote Park where you can enjoy views of the River Kennet and some attractive woodland. At the western end of the park there's the village of Ramsbury while at the eastern end there's Chilton Foliat to explore. Both are worthy villages with nice riverside trails and good refreshment options.",
