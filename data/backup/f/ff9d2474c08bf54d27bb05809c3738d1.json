  "description": "Enjoy miles of woodland cycling and walking trails in this large forest near Killerton. There are a number of waymarked trails to try starting from the National Trust Car Park. The forest is excellent for wildlife spotting with various birds and deer to look out for. It is also well known for its butterflies with white admiral, small pearl-bordered fritillary, dark green fritillary, purple emperor and silver-washed fritillary amongst the species. You can extend your exercise by heading to the nearby Killerton Park where there are more cycling and walking tracks to try. Ashclyst Forest is located just a few miles north east of Exeter near Broadclyst .",

On the route you will find Brampford Speke and the picturesque Bickleigh Mill. The site is a fine place for an easy stroll with a historic mill and shopping area right next to the river. There's also an excellent riverside pub here too. The circular Broadclyst Walk visits the forest from the nearby village. The historic settlement is well worth exploring with an historic watermill, a 15th century church and a 16th century pub to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
