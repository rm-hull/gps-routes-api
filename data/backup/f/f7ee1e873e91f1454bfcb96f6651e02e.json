  "description": "This walk visits the Trefil Quarry in the small village of Trefil in Blaenau Gwent, south Wales. The limestone quarries sit just north of Trefil, not far from Tredegar. At 409 metres (1,342 ft) above sea level, the Ordnance Survey recognise Trefil as the highest village in Wales. You can follow a country lane north towards the quarry before picking up trails above the site with some fine views over the unusual landscape of the quarry. The route then continues south to visit Shon-Sheffrey's Reservoir before returning to the village. Along the way there's some nice views of the surrounding countryside and moorland too. You can see the nearby Sirhowy Valley and the mountains of the Brecon Beacons National Park from these fine vantage points. The area is also great for wildlife with ring ouzel, wheatear, stonechat, whinchat, snipe and red grouse to look out for. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit Parc Bryn Bach where there are some lovely walks around a pretty lake and park.",
