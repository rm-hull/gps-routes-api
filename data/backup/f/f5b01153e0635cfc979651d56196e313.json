  "description": "This Leicestershire based village lies just to the north of Market Harborough in the Harborough district of the county. The charming village includes many historical features including a noteworthy church dating back to the 13th century. For walkers there's some pleasant country footpaths and easy walks along the nearby canal. This circular walk from the village visits Bowden Hall before linking up with the Grand Union Canal. You can then follow the towpath into Market Harborough where you can explore the attractive canal wharf. The route then passes through the town before returning you to Great Bowden. You could extend the walk by continuing west to visit one of the higlights of the area at Foxton Locks. Here you will find an impressive staircase of locks set in a lovely country park.",
