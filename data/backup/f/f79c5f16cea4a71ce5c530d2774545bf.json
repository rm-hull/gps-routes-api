  "description": "Explore this beautiful river gorge on this waterside walk in Knaresborough. This circular walk takes you through the wooded gorge before crossing the Nidd Viaduct and returning to Knaresborough through the countryside around Old Bilton. It makes use of the Harrogate Ringway long distance path for part of the route. The walk starts in Knaresborough at the Conyngham Hall car park near the town centre and train station. You then head along Harrogate Road and High Bond End Road before turning down Lands Lane towards the river. The trail then weaves its way through the ancient woodland to Viaduct Wood and the Nidd Viaduct. Look out for a variety wildlife such as tawny owl, roe deer, woodpeckers and herons on the water. You then cross the Nidd Viaduct and head through the village of Old Bilton. The final section takes you through the countryside along Bilton Lane to the finish point back at the car park. Although this route is designed for walkers the section from the village of Old Bilton to Knaresborough follows the Beryl Burton Cycleway so cyclists can enjoy a nice traffic free path in the area too. The Knaresborough Round passes through the gorge so you could pick up this 20 mile circular trail to extend your walk. There's also the shorter Knaresborough River Walk which starts from the nearby 12th century Knaresborough Castle and explores the pretty grounds of Conyngham Hall.",
