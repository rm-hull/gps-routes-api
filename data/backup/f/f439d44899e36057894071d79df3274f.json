  "description": "This circular woodland walk in the Cotswolds visits Cranham Woods, Buckholt Woods and Coopers Hill. These large peaceful woods have miles of walking trails through attractive Beech woodland. Cyclists can try a series of downhill mountain bike trails. The walk starts from the parking area at the southern end of the woods near Cranham. You then head through Buckholt Wood towards Cooper's Hill, site of the Cheese Rolling event held on the Spring Bank Holiday which involves locals chasing a large round cheese down a near-vertical grass slope. The route then heads through Cooper's Hill Woods before returning to the car park. If you would like to extend your walk then you could visit the nearby Prinknash Abbey Park or climb Painswick Beacon for wonderful views over the Cotswolds. Much of this walk makes use of the Cotswold Way National Trail so you could also continue east along the trail through Witcombe Wood to Birdlip Hill and the lovely Crickley Hill Country Park .",
