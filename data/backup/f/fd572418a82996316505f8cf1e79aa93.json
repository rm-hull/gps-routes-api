  "description": "This lovely circular walk explores Cemaes Bay and Wylfa Head on the Anglesey coast. The bay is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty which is also partly owned by the National Trust. On the route there's fine views over to the Isle of Man and the mountains of Northern Ireland on a clear day. The walk starts on the front in Cemaes village and follows the Anglesey Coast Path west along the bay to Wylfa Head. On this headland you can sometimes see porpoises in the seas below. After rounding the headland the route passes the old Wylfa Power Station before picking up paths to take you east through the countryside. These lead you back to the village where you can stop at the Cemaes Heritage Centre. The centre forms a permanent exhibition, a meeting room and training room. It features a brand new heritage experience, in which one can learn about the bygone era of Cemaes and the parish of Llanbadrig. There's also a a nice tea room where you can enjoy refreshments after your exercise. To continue your walking in the area head west and explore the delightful Cemlyn Bay. There's a nice circular walk here with fine views over the bay. You can pick up the Anglesey Coast Path and follow the waymarked trail to the bay. Heading north east will take you to the interesting Llanbadrig Church. Those who make the pilgrimage from Cemaes to the headland to the east, where the church stands, will be rewarded by both the history of the church and views on a clear day to the Isle of Man, the hills of the Lake District and the Mountains of Mourne in Ireland.",

A little further east is the climb to Parys Mountain where there are fine views over the area. The lovely waterside paths at Llyn Alaw lie just to the south. The lake is the largest body of water on the island. A couple of miles to the west of the lake there's also Llanddeusant where you can explore the fascinating Llynon Mill. The 18th century mill is notable as the only working windmill in Wales. The site also includes two Iron Age roundhouses where you can learn all about the ancient history of the area.
