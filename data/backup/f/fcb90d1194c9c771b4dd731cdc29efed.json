  "description": "This coastal walk takes you along the East Yorkshire coast from Barmston to Bridlington via Fraisthorpe and Auburn. The flat easy walk passes along the lovely sandy beach with fine views throughout. It runs for a distance of just under 5 miles. You can start the walk from the public car park on the sea front at Barmston. Then head north along Barmston Sands, Fraisthorpe Sands, and Auburn Sands where you will pass the site of the medieval village of Auburn. The final section takes you past Wilsthorpe and Hilderthorpe before passing along Bridlington's South Sands and finishing at the pier. You can extend your outing on the Bridlington to Flamborough Head Coastal Walk. This continues north to Flamborough Head where you can enjoy wonderful cliff top views and look out for a wide variety of sea birds.",
