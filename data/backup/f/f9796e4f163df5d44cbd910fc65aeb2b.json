From here you can pick up footpaths heading south west up to the hill. The summit stands at a height of 383 metres, commanding fine views over the surrounding West Pennine Moors . On the way there are some surfaced stone paths, old stone walls and a ruined farmhouse to see in this remote moorland area. To continue your walking in the area head a few miles south to Rivington Country Park where you can enjoy the popular climbs to Rivington Pike and Winter Hill .
