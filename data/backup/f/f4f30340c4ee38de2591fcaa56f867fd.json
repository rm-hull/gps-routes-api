  "description": "This short easy cycle or walk trail runs from Swindon to Chiseldon along the old Swindon to Marlborough railway line. The trail starts near Swindon Country Cricket Ground and heads to the lovely Coate Water Country Park where you can hire boats or try your hand at the crazy golf. The route then joins the disused railway path which takes you to Chiseldon and includes a stretch through a delightful bluebell wood. For walkers the best start point is at Coate Water where there is parking next to the trail start. To continue your cycling around Swindon see our circular Swindon Cycle Route which visits several of the parks in the town.",
