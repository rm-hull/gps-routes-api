  "description": "This Lancashire based town has some fine local parks and country trails to explore. This circular walk from the town visits Worden Park to the south of the town. The walk starts in the town centre in the Towngate area. From here it is a short stroll south to the entrance of Worden Park. The 150 acre park has well laid out footpaths taking you to woodland, formal gardens,a conservatory and a maze. After exploring the park you could visit the South Ribble Museum & Exhibition Centre located near the start of the walk. Here you can find out all about the history of the area including the famous Leyland Motors which was based in the town. The company manufactured lorries, buses and trolleybuses during the 20th century.",
