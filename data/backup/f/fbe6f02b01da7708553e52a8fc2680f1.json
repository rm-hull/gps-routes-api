  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Scar House Reservoir to Angram Reservoir in Nidderdale. The reservoir has a well surfaced footpath running around the perimeter and a car park at the eastern end. It runs for nearly 4 miles and is fairly flat so will suit most abilities. The surrounding countryside is beautiful with views of the Yorkshire Hills and the River Nidd. You can easily extend your walk by picking up the Nidderdale Way and heading along the river. Following the trail south will take you to Middlesmoor where you can visit the wonderful How Stean Gorge .",
