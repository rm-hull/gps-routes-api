  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside walk along the River Cam and River Great Ouse from Cambridge to Ely. The route runs for about 18 miles on nice flat paths so could be completed in a day. You can catch a direct train back to Cambridge at the end of your walk. It's a really beautiful stretch of water with pretty marinas, lots of wildlife and lovely views of the surrounding Cambridgeshire countryside. Starting in Cambridge the route passes Milton Country Park, Horningsea, Waterbeach, Upware, Little Thetford before arriving in Ely. The route uses a section of the Fen Rivers Way long distance trail. You can extend the walk by continuing along the Great Ouse to Littleport. You can also link up with the Harcamlow Way near Horningsea.",
