  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside walk along the River Cam and River Great Ouse from Cambridge to Ely. The route runs for about 18 miles on nice flat paths so could be completed in a day. You can catch a direct train back to Cambridge at the end of your walk. It's a really beautiful stretch of water with pretty marinas, lots of wildlife and lovely views of the surrounding Cambridgeshire countryside. Starting in Cambridge the route passes Milton Country Park, Horningsea, Waterbeach, Upware, Little Thetford before arriving in Ely. The route uses a section of the Fen Rivers Way long distance trail. You can extend the walk by continuing along the Great Ouse to Littleport. You can also link up with the Harcamlow Way near Horningsea.",

      "content": "Head a few miles south of the city and you could visit the nearby village of Haslingfield. Here you'll find pleasant walks along the River Rhee, rows of quaint thatched cottages, a church dating back to the 12th century and a noteworthy Tudor Manor House where Queen Elizabeth I stayed during the 16th century. Just to the north of the city is the delightful Wicken Fen. The nature reserve is a great place for walking and cycling with flowering meadows, reedbeds, waterways and an abundance of wildlife to see. The Lodes Way can also be picked up here. This circular walk or cycle follows National Cycle Route 11 through the Cambridgeshire Lodes, a series of ancient man made waterways created to link a series of Fenland villages to the River Cam. On the way it visits the Jacobean mansion of Anglesey Abbey. The historic site includes some beautiful gardens with ornate statues and herbaceous borders."
