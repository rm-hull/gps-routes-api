      "caption": "Sharpham House was designed in 1770 by Sir Robert Taylor for Captain Philemon Pownall, R.N. Although building started in 1770 it was not completed until 1826, after Captain Pownell's death. In 1954 W.G.Hoskins described the house as \"externally a plain, almost ugly, late Georgian house . . .\" The principal rooms are decorated in the Adam style and the gardens were laid out by \"Capability\" Brown. The house is now the home of the Sharpham Centre for Contemporary Buddhist Enquiry which runs numerous courses and is also a non-sectarian retreat."

  "description": "This walk explores the Sharpham House Estate in Devon near Totnes . The estate is now a retreat where people can learn relaxing mindful meditation techniques in beautiful surroundings. The site includes a Grade I listed Palladian villa\u00a0with parkland, gardens, woodland and views of the River Dart which flows along the eastern edge of the estate. It's a great place for wildlife too with the birds such as the rare Cirl Bunting to look out for. The estate is open to the public on certain days with more details on the link below. You can also follow the public footpaths to the south and west of the site at anytime. The Dart Valley Trail runs along the western edge of the estate. You could pick up this long distance trail and follow it north along the river into Totnes. Heading south would take you to Ashprington and Tuckenhay where there's a noteworthy 18th century pub.",
