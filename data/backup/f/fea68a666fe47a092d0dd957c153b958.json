  "description": "This circular walk visits St Agnes Head before climbing St Agnes Beacon and visiting the fascinating Wheal Coates tin mine on the Cornish coast. It's a beautiful area with yellow gorse and purple heather prominent features in the late summer months. The area also has a fascinating mining history with atmospheric coastal ruins dating from the early 19th century. It is often referred to as Poldark country because of the associations with the historical novels by Winston Graham and the television series starring Aidan Turner. There's a car park on the headland where you can start your walk. After exploring the headland the route then climbs inland to St Agnes Beacon. The hill stands at a height of 189m (620 ft), commanding fabulous views over the surrounding coast and countryside. After descending the beacon the route then heads to the Wheal Coates tin mine. The mine is one of the highlights of the area with dramatic ruins overlooking a beautiful coastline. It was opened in 1802 and closed in 1889 when the price of tin fell. The route then heads along the coast to visit Chapel Porth where there is a lovely beach. From here you follow the coast path back to the St Agnes Head car park. To extend your walk you can head south and visit the Chapel Combe valley and the popular village of Porthtowan. Heading north east along the South West Coast Path will take you to Perranporth.",

It's about a 5 mile walk to the worthy settlement where you will find a splendid pub right on the beautiful beach. Just south of Newquay you can pick up the Holywell to Crantock Circular Walk to visit the lovely Holywell Bay and the secluded beach at Porth Joke. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
