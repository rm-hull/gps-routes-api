  "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking trails in this large area of woodland near the Wiltshire village of Great Wishford. This route starts in Great Wishford and makes use of the Monarch's Way and the Salisbury Country Way to take you into the woods. Start off in the village centre and then follow the Grovely Road south west to the woods. There's lots of nice wide trails with beech trees lining the way. Look out for a variety of birdlife and the Purple Emperor butterfly as you make your way around the expansive site. A Roman road also passes through the centre of the woods. This makes for a good cycle path taking you from one end of the woods to the other. You can pick up the path from Wilton and head west to the forest, as an alternative route. It's a great area for mountain bikes with lots of additional trails to choose from. If you would like to extend your walking in the area then the village of Great Wishford and the surrounding area is well worth exploring. The village has a fascinating parish church with a 13th-century chancel and 15th-century tower. You can also enjoy a stroll along the River Wylye which runs through the village. If you continue west along the Monarch's Way it will take you to Great Ridge Wood where there are more good woodland trails to try.",
