  "description": "Explore over 800 acres of heathland and woodland on this walk in Surrey. This circular walk starts from the Ockham Common car park and takes you past the lovely Bolder Mere where you can look out for various dragonflies. You then head through Wisley Common on more woodland trails before passing Cockrow Hill and returning to the car park. There's lots of interesting wildlife to look out for including the rare hobby bird. In the spring you can see bluebells in the woods and in the autumn lots of pretty heather. The route passes very close to the delightful Wisley Gardens. Wisley is second only to Kew Gardens on the list of the most visited paid entry gardens in the country. Park features include several ponds with fountains and a canal with water lilies. On the other side of the common you will find Painshill Park. Here you can explore 158 acres of 18th century landscaped parkland with waterside footpaths along the large Serpentine Lake and a number of peaceful woodland trails. Just to the west of the common you can visit the picturesque Pyrford Lock on the River Wey Navigation. There's lovely waterside trails, views of the historic Newark Priory and a splendid canalside pub to be found here.",
