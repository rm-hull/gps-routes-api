  "description": "This Hampshire based coastal town sits on the western side of Portsmouth Harbour, opposite the city of Portsmouth. It's a fine place for a walk with old coastal forts, lakes, lovely sea views and an interesting naval history. This walk follows the Solent Way across the sea front to Alver Valley Country Park. The walk starts in Falkland Gardens next to the Gosport Ferry Terminal where there are great views over Portsmouth Harbour and the boats of the Royal Naval Dockyard. From here you can pick up the Solent Way and follow the waymarked footpath west across Haslar Lake to Clayhall. You continue to the coast where you'll come to Fort Gilkicker, a historic Palmerston fort built during the mid 19th century. The route then turns north west to head along Stokes Bay where there is a shingle beach and nice sea views. You will then pass Browndown before entering the Alver Valley Country Park. There's some pleasant boardwalk trails along the River Alver with lots of wildlife to see in the nature reserve area of the park. If you would like to extend the walk then you could continue west along the coast path to visit neigbouring Lee on Solent and the wildlife rich Titchfield Haven in Fareham .",
