The highest point in Hastings, now named North's Seat, is at the top of Fairlight Down in Hastings Country Park. The spot is named after Frederick North (MP) who represented the town during the 19th century."

  "description": "Enjoy over 600 acres of beautiful parkland and coast on this circular route in Hastings. The park is located in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, most of the park has been designated a Special Area of Conservation and a Local Nature Reserve. Peregrines, black redstarts and fulmars can be seen on the coastal cliffs, while Dartford warblers, stonechats and yellowhammers can be seen on the gorse covered hills. The route below is most suitable for walkers but National Cycle Network route 2 also runs through the park and is a short cycle from Hastings. See the Eastbourne to Rye Cycle Route for more details. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the Rye to Hastings Walk and visit the beautiful Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. You could also try our longer Hastings Circular Walk which visits the park and starts from the harbour in the town. The Eastbourne to Hastings Walk is another good, long distance option.",
