  "description": "With 865 acres of parkland, beautiful landscaped Cornish gardens and stunning coastline, Mount Edgcumbe Country Park is a fantastic place to visit. This circular walk begins at the parking lot, near the Cremyll Ferry which you can catch from Plymouth to the park. The path then joins the coastal path to Raveness Point, passing the beautiful Barn Pool (see video) and the Raven's Cliffs. You continue to Picklecombe Point before returning to the start point through the delightful deer park, passing the magnificent Mount Edgcumbe House on the way. NB. The route below is designed for walkers but National Cycle Network route 2 runs through the park. Also see the Plymouth to Looe cycle route for a ride through Devon to Cornwall which runs through the park.",
