  "description": "This lovely waymarked walk explores the Teme Valley around the Worcestershire village of Martley. There's beautiful countryside, traditional orchards, riverside paths and woodland trails to enjoy on the way. The route runs for about 6 miles on fairly flat paths with some small climbs. Start the walk in the centre of the village and follow the footpaths north past the The Chantry School towards the orchards around Alden's Farm and Prickley Green Farm. The path then turns west towards Rodge Hill Farm where you pick up a section of the Worcestershire Way long distance trail. You then climb south to Rodge Hill and Pudford Hill where there are splendid views over the surrounding countryside. From this high point of the walk you descend to Hambridge Farm where you pick up a riverside path along the River Teme, passing the woodland on Kingswood Common before turning east to return to the village. Back in Martley you can enjoy refreshments at the local pub and pay a visit to the interesting Norman Church of St Peter. The church includes a complete set of 17th century bells and some medieval wall paintings inside. To extend the walk you could contine south along the Worcestershire Way to Berrow Green and Ankerdine Hill . The hill is located near Knightwick where you can pick up our River Teme Walk to Worcester. An Iron Age Hillfort can also be found at nearby Berrow Hill, just to the west of Berrow Green. Heading north along the Worcestershire Way will take you to Abberley where there's some nice woodland trails around Abberley Hill on the Abberley Circular Walk .",
