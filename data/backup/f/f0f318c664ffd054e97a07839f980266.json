  "description": "This walk is a moderate climb to Ashurst Hill from the Lancashire village of Appley Bridge. It's a circular walk, taking in some lovely Lancashire countryside with splendid views and a nice waterside stroll along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The walk starts from the train station at Appley Bridge and heads south west along country lanes and public footpaths to the beacon. From the 172m (564ft) summit there are wonderful views to the coast and Blackpool Tower. After taking in the fine views, the walk descends past Dalton to the River Douglas and the canal. Here you can enjoy a stroll along the water before returning to the train station. You can extend your walking in the area by climbing to the nearby Parbold Hill. It's only about a mile west of the station and affords more great views to the Pennines and the Welsh Mountains. Also near the station is the delightful Fairy Glen. The hidden beauty spot includes pretty streams, beautiful waterfalls, dramatic cliff faces, wooden bridges and shady woodland trails.",
