Although not easy to see it here, the spot in this photo was at one time the centre of a Roman tile making complex which included a villa (here), a bathhouse and numerous clay pits, the various earthworks and ditches of which can still be clearly seen amongst the trees. As well as Roman sites, Ashtead Common boasts prehistoric earthworks, mediaeval boundary systems and a C17th brick-lined spring."

  "description": "This circular walk from the village visits the Chessington World of Adventures before heading to three of the highlights of the area at Epsom Common, Ashtead Common National Nature Reserve and Horton Country Park. The walk starts from Chessington South train station where you head south west to Winey Hill and the public footpath which runs along the western edge of the famous Chessington Theme Park and Zoo. The route continues south past Chessington Wood and out into the countryside around Malden Rushett. You'll then enter Epsom Common, passing the ponds before looping round to the Ashtead Common Nature Reserve. There's miles of trails on the commons with lots of woodland birds to look out for on the way. After exploring the commons the route picks up the London Loop and follows the waymarked trail north to West Park Farm and Horton Country Park. There's 400 acres of parkland here with woodland, ponds and country views to enjoy. From the park it's a short walk east to return to the train station where the route finishes.",
