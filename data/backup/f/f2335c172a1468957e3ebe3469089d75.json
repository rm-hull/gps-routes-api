  "description": "This walk takes you from Langsett Reservoir to Ladybower Reservoir in the Peak District. The route runs for about 10 miles, crossing the hills of the Howden Moors in between the two bodies of water. There's some moderate hill climbs with wonderful views and lovely heather moorland scenery to enjoy on the way. The route starts from the car park and visitor centre at Langsett Reservoir and follows footpaths around the water to Hingcliff Common. You then follow a bridleway south along Mickleden Edge towards Howden Edge and Margery Hill. The route then descends through Cranberry Clough to Howden Reservoir where you pick up a lovely footpath to take you to the Derwent and Ladybower Reservoirs. On the way look out for the historic Slippery Stones packhorse bridge at the northern end of Howden Reservoir. The 17th century bridge is a reminder of the former Derwent Village which was 'drowned' in 1944 when the\u00a0Ladybower Reservoir\u00a0was created.",
