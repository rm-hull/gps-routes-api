This track runs through a large field, of wheat in early August 2009, cut a few days later, and its verge contained a wide variety of plants, including thistle and burdock, which were attracting many butterflies on the first visit. A few days later the burdock was no longer flowering, and the wheat had been cut, and there were far less butterflies to be seen. While it may be an open track through a wheat field there is much to see if you know how to read the countryside and how it changes through the year."

  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk around these pretty reservoirs in Hertfordshire. The four reservoirs include Startops End, Marsworth, Tringford and Wilstone Reservoir. They are fantastic for birdwatching with visitors including grebes, bitterns, peregrine falcon, pied flycatcher and ringed plovers. This circular walk starts at the village of Marsworth and takes you around the reservoirs on a series of footpaths before returning along the Grand Union Canal. It's a nice easy walk with many waterside sections. The walk can be extended by picking up the Aylesbury Ring or Grand Union Canal Walk which run through the area. You could head west along the Aylesbury Canal into Aylesbury which is about 6 miles from the reservoirs. You could also pick up the Wendover Canal Arm and follow it south west into Wendover.",

The classic village pub includes a fine interior with an inglenook fireplace, exposed wooden beams and old photographs featuring village scenes and personalities past and present. They serve good food and have a nice garden area for warmer days. You can find them on Tring Road at postcode HP23 4PD for your sat navs."

      "content": "Just over a mile east of Marsworth Reservoir you'll find the noteworthy Pitstone Windmill. The National Trust owned mill dates back to the 17th century and as is Grade II listed. For a small fee you can explore both the inner and outer workings of the mill and learn about the grinding of the flour in the milling process. The climb to the iconic Ivinghoe Beacon also starts from the windmill car park. From here you can enjoy wonderful views over the surrounding area. The circular Wiggington Walk and the Tring Circular Walk pass close to the site and provide a further opportunity for exploring the area. Head north along the canal and you can visit the historic village of Mentmore where you will find several interesting old buildings associated with the 19th century Mentmore Towers Estate. For more walking ideas in the area see the Chilterns Walks and Buckinghamshire Walks pages."
