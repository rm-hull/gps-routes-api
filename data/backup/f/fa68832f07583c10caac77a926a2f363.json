This track runs through a large field, of wheat in early August 2009, cut a few days later, and its verge contained a wide variety of plants, including thistle and burdock, which were attracting many butterflies on the first visit. A few days later the burdock was no longer flowering, and the wheat had been cut, and there were far less butterflies to be seen.\nWhile it may be an open track through a wheat field there is much to see if you know how to read the countryside and how it changes through the year."

  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk around these pretty reservoirs in Hertfordshire. The four reservoirs include Startops End, Marsworth, Tringford and Wilstone Reservoir . They are fantastic for birdwatching with visitors including grebes, bitterns,\u00a0peregrine falcon,\u00a0pied flycatcher\u00a0and ringed plovers. This circular walk starts at the village of Marsworth and takes you around the reservoirs on a series of footpaths before returning along the Grand Union Canal . It's a nice easy walk with many waterside sections. The walk can be extended by picking up the Aylesbury Ring or Grand Union Canal Walk which run through the area. You could head west along the Aylesbury Canal into Aylesbury which is about 6 miles from the reservoirs. You could also pick up the Wendover Canal Arm and follow it south west into Wendover.",
