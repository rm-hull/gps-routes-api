The name \"shade\" does not refer to a shady area (there are few trees on this wet heathland anyway), but instead it refers to something the ponies do: when they \"shade\" they stand out the heat of the day away from the undergrowth where insects are more of a nuisance. On a mild spring day such as this the ponies (and some cattle) are more likely to be grazing on the lawn rather than standing - food supplies are low and they have used up their fat reserves accumulated last year."

  "description": "This circular walk explores a lovely area of the New Forest between the village of Frogham and Fritham in Hampshire. The walk starts from the Abbots Well public car park on Hyde Common in Frogham. From here you can pick up footpaths heading east to up to the Hampton Ridge where there are some fine views over the area from the elevated position. You will pass Windmill Hill and Thompson's Castle before heading into the woodland of the Amberwood Inclosure. The route continues east to Hiscocks Hill and Gorley Bushes before coming to Fritham village. Here you could stop for some refreshments at the Royal Oak, roughly the half way point on the walk. The route then heads west across Fritham Plain, passing Freeworms Hill, the Sloden Inclosure, Deadbuck Hill, Hallickshole Hill and the Alderhill Inclosure. The final section passes along the pretty Latchmore Brook before returning to Hyde Common and the car park.",
