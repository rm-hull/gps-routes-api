  "description": "Travel from Knaresborough to the village of Old Bilton on this traffic free cycle path. It starts near the town centre and train station in Knaresborough and heads west through Foolish Wood to Old Bilton passing Bilton Hall Farm on the way. The route can be extended to nearby Harrogate along National Cycle Network Route 67. It's a quiet country lane with nice countryside views so it's also suitable for walkers. You can extend your exercise by heading to the lovely Nidd Gorge. The walk takes you along the River Nidd through a lovely wooded gorge before crossing the Nidd Viaduct. The Nidderdale Greenway runs past the viaduct so this is a good option for continuing your exercise. The traffic free path runs into Ripley along a dismantled railway line.",
