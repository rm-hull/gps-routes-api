  "description": "Visit the Otway Fly and enjoy a walk along the longest and highest steel canopy walkway in the world. The walkway runs for 600 metres reaching a maximum height of 47 metres. Located in in western Victoria, the forest includes trees such as Myrtle beech and Mountain ash, the tallest hardwood species in the world. To return to the forest floor you can try the exhilirating 30 metre zip-line! To continue your walking in the Otway National Park, head south along the Phillips Track to visit Triplet Falls. There's a short walking trail taking you to the three falls that cascade over a lush rainforest to the floor of the valley. There's also more elevated viewing platforms from which you can view the falls through the trees. To continue your tree top walking in Australia head to Tasmania and try the Tahune AirWalk. The route runs through the Huon Valley with fine views of the Huon River, the Hartz Mountains and the Picton River. You can see more details on our Tree Top Walk Tasmania page.",
