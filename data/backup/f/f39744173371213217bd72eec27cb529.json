It's about a 6 mile walk with somer moderate climbs so a reaonable level of fitness is required. Starting in Woolacombe the path heads south along Woolacombe Sand and Morte Bay.

Here you will find sandstone rocks popular with climbers and splendid views towards Lundy Island . The final section runs along the headland before finishing at Croyde Sands. The walk uses sections of the South West Coast Path and Tarka Trail . You can extend your walking on the Ilfracombe to Woolacombe Coastal Walk to the north or continue south to Saunton Sands , Crow Point and the lovely Braunton Burrows .",
