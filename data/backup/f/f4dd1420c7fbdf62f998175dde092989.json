The aftermath of the extraordinary snowstorm that occurred over a narrow band of the Midlands and South East England on 28 October 2008 is recorded here. It began snowing at about 6pm in London Colney continuing for several hours. The weight of the snow combined with the fact that many trees had not yet shed their leaves caused many branches to snap off. Such was the general coldness that the snow was still present in small patches two days afterwards. This is the River Colne on the morning after looking upstream towards Telford's bridge."

  "description": "The idyllic\u00a0Hertfordshire village of Shenley sits in a pleasant rural position on the outskirts of North London. This walk from the village visits Salisbury Hall and the de Havilland Aircraft Museum. You'll also pass the training grounds of Arsenal F.C and Watford F.C before heading to the village of London Colney . Here you can enjoy river walks along the River Colne. The walk starts in Shenley and follows country lanes north east past Combe Wood to Shenley Hill. You pass along Rectory Lane to Pinks Hotel where you turn to north to follow footpaths up to Salisbury Hall and the de Havilland Aircraft Museum . Here you'll find a collection of aircraft including the\u00a0de Havilland Mosquito\u00a0and the\u00a0de Havilland Vampire\u00a0\u2013 the third operational jet aircraft in the world. The Mosquito W4050 is particularly noteworthy being the only surviving World War II twin piston engine prototype of a combat aircraft to be preserved in the World. It can now be viewed by the public on the very site where it was designed and built. After exploring the museum the route continues north to visit London Colney. Here you'll find public footpaths running along a series of lakes next to the River Colne. It's a very pretty area which includes a picturesque village green and a splendid old seven arch bridge over the river. The route then heads back through the countryside to Shenley on different public footpaths.",
