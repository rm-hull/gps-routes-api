The aftermath of the extraordinary snowstorm that occurred over a narrow band of the Midlands and South East England on 28 October 2008 is recorded here. It began snowing at about 6pm in London Colney continuing for several hours. The weight of the snow combined with the fact that many trees had not yet shed their leaves caused many branches to snap off. Such was the general coldness that the snow was still present in small patches two days afterwards. This is the River Colne on the morning after looking upstream towards Telford's bridge."

  "description": "The idyllic Hertfordshire village of Shenley sits in a pleasant rural position on the outskirts of North London. This walk from the village visits Salisbury Hall and the de Havilland Aircraft Museum. You'll also pass the training grounds of Arsenal F.C and Watford F.C before heading to the village of London Colney. Here you can enjoy river walks along the River Colne. The walk starts in Shenley and follows country lanes north east past Combe Wood to Shenley Hill. You pass along Rectory Lane to Pinks Hotel where you turn to north to follow footpaths up to Salisbury Hall and the de Havilland Aircraft Museum. Here you'll find a collection of aircraft including the de Havilland Mosquito and the de Havilland Vampire \u2013 the third operational jet aircraft in the world. The Mosquito W4050 is particularly noteworthy being the only surviving World War II twin piston engine prototype of a combat aircraft to be preserved in the World. It can now be viewed by the public on the very site where it was designed and built. After exploring the museum the route continues north to visit London Colney. Here you'll find public footpaths running along a series of lakes next to the River Colne. It's a very pretty area which includes a picturesque village green and a splendid old seven arch bridge over the river. The route then heads back through the countryside to Shenley on different public footpaths.",

      "content": "To the west of the village you can pick up the Ver-Colne Valley Walk. This long distance footpaths runs along the Rivers Colne and Ver through some lovely countryside. Next to the trail you'll also find Bricket Wood Common where there are some peaceful woodland trails. To the north there's the town of St Albans to explore. The St Albans Walk takes you to the Roman Verlulamium Park, the Watercress Wildlife Site and the River Ver. On the northern outskirts of the town there's also miles of good cycling and walking trails to be found around the Heartwood Forest near Sandridge. Also to the north there's the town of Hatfield where you can explore the grounds of the historic Hatfield House. The grounds include several waymarked walking trails with woodland, parkland and gardens to see. A few miles south west there's Aldenham Country Park to explore. There's some nice waterside trails around the park's large lakes here.  Also to the south you can pick up the Dollis Valley Green Walk and follow the pretty Dollis Brook towards the village of Totteridge in Barnet. It's a nice place to visit with a pretty village green, a cricket pitch, some pleasant local countryside and a nearby nature reserve to visit. Just east is the neighbouring village of Ridge where you'll find the noteworthy Old Guinea pub. The early 19th century inn has a particularly lovely large garden with stunning views across the surrounding countryside. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hertfordshire Walks page."
