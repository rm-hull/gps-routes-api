  "description": "This circular walk from the Somerset village of Freshford takes you to Avoncliff with its splendid aqueduct on the River Avon and Kennet and Avon Canal. The walk starts from Freshford train station which is on the Great Western Railway. You can catch trains here from Southampton, Bath and Bristol. After leaving the station head south east to join with a footpath along the River Avon. This will take you through Avoncliff Wood to the Avoncliff aqueduct. The significant structure carries the Kennet and Avon Canal and the Bath to Westbury railway line over the River Avon. It was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas, between 1797 and 1801 and is a Grade II listed building. From its elevated position there are fine views over the river below. After crossing to the other side you can follow footpaths north west along the river past Winsley and Murhill. After you pass the weir you can cross to the other side and follow country lanes and another footpath back to the train station. This walk finishes here but you could stroll a short distance through the village to the River Frome. Here you'll find more nice riverside footpaths and Freshford Mill.",
