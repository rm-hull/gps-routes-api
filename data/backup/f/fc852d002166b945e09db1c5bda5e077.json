  "description": "This East Lothian coastal walk takes you from Aberlady to Gullane along the beautiful Aberlady Bay Nature Reserve. The reserve was the first Local Nature Reserve to be founded in Britain in 1952. The walk follows a section of the John Muir Way for a distance of about 5 miles. On the way you will pass Marl Loch and Gullane Sands before coming into Gullane. Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of birdlife including Reed Bunting and Pink-footed Geese. The area includes Waterston House, the headquarters of the Scottish Ornithologists' Club (SOC). There is a huge ornithological library here, thought to be the largest in Scotland. Habitats in the reserve include salt marsh and sand dune with lots of wildflowers and rare plants to see as well. You can extend the walk on the Gullane to North Berwick Walk which continues east along the coast with views across the Firth of Forth to a series of islands, including the RSPB's Fidra Island.",
