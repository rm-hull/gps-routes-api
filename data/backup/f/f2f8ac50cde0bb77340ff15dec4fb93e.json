  "description": "This pretty village in North Cornwall is located near the coast in the Bude area. This circular walk from the village takes you along the Bude Canal to neighbouring Bude before returning on a shared cycle path. Along the way there's pleasant waterside paths and some lovely views of the River Neet valley countryside. You could extend the walk by heading west to pick up the Bude to Widemouth Bay Walk and enjoy a lovely coastal walk along the South West Coast Path .",
