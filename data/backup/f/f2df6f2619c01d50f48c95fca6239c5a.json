  "description": "This walk explores the woodland trails in the expansive Bishop Wood near Selby, Cawood and Wistow. The woods are located just a few miles north west of Selby. You can start the walk from the parking area of Scalm Lane. Then pick up a series of flat footpaths taking you around the northern part of the ancient woodland. The trails make for particularly fine autumn woodland walk and there are pretty bluebells to see in the spring months too. Look out for a variety of woodland birds and wildflowers in the warmer seasons.",

Skipwith Common is also near the town. Highlights here include the Exmoor ponies and herd of wild deer on the common. The wood can also be reached by tracks from the nearby village of Sherburn in Elmet."
