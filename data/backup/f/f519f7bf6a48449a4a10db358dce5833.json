At 475m above sea level, it provides great views across the Usk Valley towards the cone of the Sugarloaf Mountain on the other side. The pond was built around 1824 to provide water for the Garn Ddyrys Forge near Govilon in the valley below. It is probably known by this name as it was near the house of the Earl of Abergavenny's gamekeeper. Its Welsh name of Pen-ffordd-goch, translates as 'head of the red road', probably a reference to the red sandstone which was used in the construction of the mountain road to Govilon."
