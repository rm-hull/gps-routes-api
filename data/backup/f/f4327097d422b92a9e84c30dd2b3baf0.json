  "description": "This delightful Kentish village is a fine spot for riverside walks and access to the North Downs countryside. There's also some interesting history with an old priory, a medieval castle and a nearby museum to visit. This circular river walk from the village takes you along a section of the Medway Valley Walk. The waymarked trail will take you along both sides of the river, visiting several local highlights including Allington Castle, Allington Lock, the Museum of Kent Life and Aylesford Priory on the way. The walk starts on Aylesford bridge. This medieval bridge was one of the earliest bridges to be built across the River Medway, dating back to the 14th century. From here you can follow the northern side of the river east to Allington where you will pass the Museum of Kent Life. This open-air museum includes a thatched barn, an oast house and a farm with animals. It is one of the few remaining places in Britain where hops are grown, harvested, dried and packed in the Oast house. Near the museum you can cross the river where you will pass Allington Castle on the southern side. This Medieval 12th-century castle is furnished with tapestries, antique furniture and a Great Hall in which Henry VIII & Anne Boleyn dined with Sir Thomas Wyatt around 1530. It's now a private residence, but can be hired as an exclusive wedding venue, corporate event venue or filming location. There's also beautiful Kentish Gardens and orchards to see at the expansive site. From the castle you head north west through Little Preston to return to Aylesford. The route then heads back to the village before continuing west to visit Aylesford Priory. Also known as The Friars this historic site dates back to the 13th century. It is now a popular place for pilgrimage, as well as for retreats and conferences. You can explore the lovely grounds and take in the stunning medieval buildings, before enjoying walks down the Peace Garden and Rosary Way. The site also includes some notable artwork such as the ceramic artist Adam Kossowski.",
