  "description": "A circular walk around Bury, taking in the River Irwell, two reservoirs and the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal. There's nice, easy waterside paths and some great views of the surrounding Pennine Hills to enjoy on the way. The walk starts in the town centre just to the west of the train station. Here you can pick up the Irwell Sculpture Trail and follow it south and then west to reach the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal. Follow the towpath south towards Radcliffe before turning right to Crow Trees Farm and Withins Reservoir. Follow the paths on the right on the reservoir and they will lead you to the larger Elton Reservoir. It's a lovely spot with nice views across the water to the rolling hills beyond. Continue north past the reservoir and you can pick up the Daisyfield Greenway which will take you back into the town centre. To continue your walking in the Bury area head north along the Irwell Sculpture Trail through Summerseat and Burrs Country Park to Ramsbottom. Here you can enjoy a climb to the Peel Tower. Located on Holcombe Hill the distinctive monument is dedicated to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th century Prime Minister considered the father of modern British policing. It's a major local landmark and worth the climb to the top for the views over Bury and the surrounding area. In Radcliffe you can pick up the Outwood Trail and visit Outwood Country Park. The cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line from Radcliffe to Prestwich, passing Clifton Country Park on the way.",
