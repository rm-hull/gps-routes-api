  "description": "This market town in Lincolnshire has some nice riverside trails and a local nature reserve to visit. It's in a notable location on the edge of the Wash where Norfolk meets Lincolnshire. In the town there's some interesting old buildings including the 14th century Guildhall, Maud Foster windmill (1819) and the impressive St Botolph\u2019s Church. This walk explores the quays and docks to the south of the town, following a footpath along The Haven river. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the Macmillan Way and follow the waymarked footpath south past the Quay, the Swing Bridge and the docks. The trail then takes you along The Haven to Slippery Gow where you can pick up alternative paths to the west of the river. These will take you north before rejoining the river and following it back into the town centre. You can extend the walk by heading north along the River Witham towards Anton's Gowt.",
