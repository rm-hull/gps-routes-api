  "description": "A fabulous circular walk around Rochdale which visits a series of lovely reservoirs and includes a section along the River Roch. The walk visits Blackstone Edge, Healey Dell, Knowl Hill, Ashworth Moor Reservoir, Greenbooth Reservoir and the Ashworth Valley where there's nice trails along the Naden Brook and the Cheesden Brook. Other highlights include Tandle Hill Country Park, Alkrington Woods, Queens Park and the Ogden and Piethorne Reservoirs in the Piethorne Valley. There are several challenging climbs but with the reward of splendid views of the area.",
