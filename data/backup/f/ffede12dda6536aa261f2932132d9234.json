  "description": "This walk visits Beauly, one of the loveliest villages in Scotland. It's a popular place to visit with a number of independent shops, cherry blossom trees and a pretty square in the centre. The walk starts at the historic Beauly Priory next to the river. The 13th century priory ruins are a fine place for a stroll in the village. Beauly is one of three priories founded in Scotland in about 1230 for monks of the Valliscaulian order. From near the priory you can then pick up a waterside trail heading east along the River Beauly. The trail will take you to Tarradale House with some nice views across the estuary and the Beauly Firth. The village is located just a few miles from Inverness where you could try the Inverness Canal and Forest Walk. There's some nice easy walks along the Caledonian Canal to enjoy here.",

The hotel takes its name from the home of the 13th Century Cistercian monks who chose Beauly as a tranquil location for their secluded meditation and worship. You can find them on the square at postcode IV4 7BX for your sat navs."
