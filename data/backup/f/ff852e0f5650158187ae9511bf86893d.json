  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Victoria Falls next to Loch Maree in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. The loch is over 13 miles long making it the fourth largest freshwater loch in Scotland. You can start your walk at the Victoria Falls car park which is located on the southern side of the loch. The splendid falls are named after Queen Victoria who visited the site in 1877. There are nice trails to follow through the surrounding Caledonian Pinewood Forest and great views over Loch Maree from the elevated position of the falls. The water at the falls comes from the Beinn Eighe mountain to the south. After viewing the falls you can stroll down to the loch shore and visit another viewpoint and car park just to the west at Slattadale. The area is great for wildlife so keep your eyes peeled for crossbills, Black-throated divers and sea eagles as you make your way along the footpaths.",
