  "description": "This walk visits the village of Kingswood in Kent. The settlement is located in the Maidstone District of the county, just west of Lenham and north east of Sutton Valence. The village is in a good spot for exploring the North Downs and is close to some pleasant woodland. This circular walk from the village explores King's Wood before heading to one of the local highlights at Leeds Castle. The walk starts in the village and heads north to explore King's Wood where there are some peaceful woodland trails to try. Continue north and you will pass Broomfield before coming to Leeds Castle. The historic castle includes 500 acres of beautiful parkland, open water and formal gardens. To continue your walking around Kingswood head south to pick up the Greensand Way .",

      "content": "Head south to Sutton Valence and you can pick up the Greensand Way. This major long distance walk follows the ridge of greensand rock through Surrey and Kent. Here you can also visit the ruins of the 12th century Sutton Valence Castle. You can then climb up to the castle and enjoy wonderful views over East Sussex and the Weald of Kent. Just to the north east there's the neighbouring village of Harrietsham where you can pick up the circular bluebell woodland walk. The walk includes a visit to the noteworthy Ringlestone Inn, a beautiful grade II listed pub housed in building dating back to 1533 and originally used as a hospice for monks."
