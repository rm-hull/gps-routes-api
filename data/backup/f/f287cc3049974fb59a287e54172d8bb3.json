  "description": "This little village is located just east of Caerphilly in the beautiful Rhymney Valley. There's lots of good walking trails, a fine local viewpoint and a splendid local pub for refreshments afterwards. This walk from the village climbs to the 222 metre high Rudry Mountain to the west of the settlement. You can follow footpaths west up to the viewpoint from the village church which dates back to the 13th century. There's also a car park just to the south of the mountain if you prefer to start from there. On the way to the top of the mountain there's lovely views over the countryside of the Rhymney Valley to enjoy.",
