  "description": "This walk visits the ruins of the ancient Pendragon Castle in Mallerstang Dale, Cumbria. The historic site is located a few miles south of Kirkby Stephen in a remote spot next to the River Eden. Pendragon is Grade I listed with a history stretching back to the 1100s. The walk starts from the car park just off the B6259 on Tommy Road. From here you can pick up paths to take you around the castle ruins. There are some excellent views to the surrounding fells as you make your way around the site. You can then continue your walk up to Castle Bridge where you can cross the river and enjoy a river side trail on the western side of the water. The castle is located on the Lady Anne's Way long distance walk. The long distance trail is named after Lady Anne Clifford who\u00a0rebuilt the castle in 1660, adding a brewhouse, bakehouse, stables and coach-house. It remained one of the favourites among her many castles until her death in 1676 at the age of 86. You could continue your walking in the area by following her trail north into Kirkby Stephen where you could enjoy some pleasant riverside trails.",
