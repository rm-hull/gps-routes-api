  "description": "This walk takes you along the beautiful Cow Green Reservoir to the spectacular Cauldron\u00a0Snout waterfall in the North Pennines AONB. You start off at the car park at Cow Green Reservoir which is located on the eastern side of the water at a postcode of DL12 0HX. From here you head 2 miles south along the reservoir to the waterfall, passing the impressive Cow Green Dam on the way. Cauldron Snout is a very powerful waterfall on three levels. At 200 yards (180\u00a0m) long, it is reckoned to be the longest waterfall in England. At the waterfall you have the option of heading back to the car park or continuing along the Pennine Way and the\u00a0River Tees towards Langdon Beck. The path runs right along the river to Sayer's Hill and Harwood Beck with plenty of wild moorland scenery to enjoy. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Cross Fell for spectacular views over the Lake District and Solway Firth. If you continue east along the Pennine Way you will soon come to High Force Waterfall . It's one of the biggest waterfalls in England and a spectacular sight with the water dropping 70 feet (21m) into a plunge pool below. If you head north you could visit Burnhope Reservoir and Burnhope Seat the highest point of County Durham.",
