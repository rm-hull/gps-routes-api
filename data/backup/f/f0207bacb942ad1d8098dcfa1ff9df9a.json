  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful waterside walk along the River Lim from Uplyme to Lyme Regis. It's a nice peaceful walk with countryside views, rushing weirs and views of the coast in Lyme Regis. Though a short route, it actually takes you from Devon into Dorset. The walk starts at the small East Devon village of Uplyme about 1.5 miles north west of the coastal resort of Dorset based Lyme Regis. You begin at the parish church of St. Peter and St. Paul\u00a0which includes a 14th century tower. From here head south along Church Street where you can pick up a footpath running along the river. A mixture of quiet lanes and riverside footpaths take you down into the town. The walk then finishes at the Lyme Regis Town Mill a\u00a0watermill\u00a0dating from 1340, which has been restored to working order, producing flour. It is powered by water from the River Lim via a leat running along a\u00a0lynch. In Lyme Regis there are several good options for extending your walk along the splendid Jurassic Coast . You could try the popular Undercliff Walk to Seaton or head to the magnificent Golden Cap Estate .",
