  "description": "This walk explores the delightful Lambley Dumbles in Nottinghamshire. The area is a lovely place for a walk with streams, waterfalls, ancient woodland and lots of interesting geology and flora to see. The walk starts in the village and then heads west to the Dumbles and Bonney Doles. Here you can pick up a circular footpath heading along both sides of the stream. There's information boards along the way which will tell you all about different plants and trees you can see on the walk. There's also a map with all the footpaths you can follow through the surrounding area. Here you'll find woodlands, orchards, rolling farmland and the scenic steep sided valleys known as the Dumbles. These valleys were formed at the end of the ice age when large amounts of thawing ice created the streams that carved out the valleys into the bedrock. The streams flow east into the village where they converge with the River Trent to form the Cocker Beck.",
