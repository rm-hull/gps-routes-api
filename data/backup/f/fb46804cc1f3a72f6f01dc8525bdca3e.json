  "description": "This expansive area of wetland in Kent is ideal for walking with miles of flat footpaths, quiet villages and beautiful scenery to enjoy. The wetland, rivers and streams on the marsh also attract a huge variety of wildlife, so keep your eyes peeled for Herons, Great Crested Grebes and the Bar Talied Godwit as you make your way through the area. This circular walk starts and ends in the town of New Romney on the edge of Romney Marsh. It visits the villages of St Mary in the Marsh, Ivychurch and Old Romney before returning to the town. Highlights on the route include the 12th century church in St Mary in the Marsh where Edith Nesbit, author of The Railway Children, is buried. At Ivychurch there is also a wonderful old church known as the 'Cathedral of Romney Marsh'. The main body of the church dates from 1360 and includes an impressive nave. To visit the marsh by bike you can follow National Cycle Network Route 2 from nearby Lydd or Hythe. There's lots of good options for extending your walking in the area. You could head to the splendid Dungeness Nature Reserve near Lydd. It's a fantastic area with coastal paths, lakes, lagoons and a huge variety of wildlife to look out for. Also nearby is the lovely waterside walk along the Royal Military Canal Path and the beautiful nature reserve at Rye Harbour .",
