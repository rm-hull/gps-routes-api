  "description": "This super walk in the Gower AONB takes you along an elevated sandstone ridge known as the 'backbone of Gower'. With a high point of 188m/617\u00a0ft the walk is quite challenging but you are rewarded with wonderful views of the coastline and countryside of the Gower Peninsula. The walk starts in the little village of Penmaen where there is parking at the National Trust car park. You then pick up the good footpath along the ridge with wonderful views back to Oxwich Bay . You continue towards Cefn Bryn Common and to the neolithic\u00a0burial ground of Arthur's Stone.\u00a0Its name comes from a legend that the ancient British\u00a0King Arthur\u00a0threw a large stone from\u00a0Llanelli\u00a0which landed on this spot. Look out for Wild ponies and horses in this area. There is also the\u00a0Broad Pool\u00a0 nature reserve consisting of a large pond which attracts wildlife such as dragonflys and wetland birds. At the summit point there is a handy toposcope detailing all the landmarks that can be seen from the hill top. This walk descends back to Penmaen from Arthur's Stone but you could continue along the ridge to Ryer's Down and Llanmadoc where you will find the splendid Whiteford Sands Nature Reserve . Here you will find woodland and sand dunes with nice coastal views to the lighthouse at Whiteford Point. The Three Cliffs Bay Walk also starts from Penmaen.",
