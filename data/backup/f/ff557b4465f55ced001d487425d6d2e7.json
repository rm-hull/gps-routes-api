The Great North Forest Heritage Trail also runs through the park so you could continue your cycle/walk along this route. If you head north you could visit the nearby Herrington Country Park, James Steel Park in Washington and the famous Penshaw Monument .",

      "content": "Head east and you can explore the coast around Seaham. Here you can pick up the Durham Coastal Footpath and visit the nearby Castle Eden Dene Nature Reserve. Just to the south you can pick up National Cycle Route 14 and the Haswell to Hart Countryside Walkway. The multi-user trail uses the trackbed of a disused railway line to travel between the two old stations. Also for cyclists the epic W2W Cycle Route - NCN 70 passes through the park. The long distance ride runs from coast to coast from Walney Island to Wearmouth in Sunderland. A few miles to the west of the park there's one of the area's historic highlights at Finchale Abbey. Here you can explore the photogenic ruins of the ancient abbey which dates back to the 13th century. The Grade I listed priory site is run by English Heritage and includes woodland and riverside walks. Near here there's also Rainton Meadows Nature Reserve. There's pretty lakes, meadows and lots of wildlife to see here. You can find the reserve only a couple of miles west of the park near East Rainton."
