  "description": "This pretty Cotswolds village is the northernmost village in the county of Gloucestershire. It's a great area for walkers with several waymarked trails running through the area. There's also some delightful gardens and excellent views from the hills surrounding the village. This walk from the village visits some of the higlights of the area using three waymarked walking trails. You'll follow sections of the Heart of England Way, the Monarch's Way and the Cotswold Way to visit the delightful Kiftsgate Gardens, Hidcote Manor Garden and the town of Chipping Campden where you can enjoy a climb to the fine viewpoint at Dover's Hill. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Heart of England Way and follow it south east to Hidcote Manor Garden. These gorgeous gardens contain a number of beautifully designed outdoor 'rooms'. Highlights include the kitchen garden, plant house, herbaceous borders and the orchard. You'll also pass Kiftsgate Court on this opening section. The gardens, famed for its roses, are the creation of three generations of women gardeners. There are public footpaths that pass both gardens but a fee is required to gain access. From Hidcote you continue to the south west towards Mickleton Hills Farm and Chipping Campden. This attractive market town has a particularly interesting High Street, with a series of buildings dating from the 14th century to the 17th century. It's a popular tourist destination because of its location, history and fine selection of inns and restaurants. After passing west through the town you turn north along the Cotwolds Way to climb to Dover's Hill. The hill is a high point on the limestone escarpment that effectively forms the northern edge of the Cotswolds. There is a spectacular view northwards across the Avon valley from here. After taking in the views the route returns to Mickleton on the same paths.",
