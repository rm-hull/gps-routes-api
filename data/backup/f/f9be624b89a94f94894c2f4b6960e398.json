  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle around the beautiful Hayle Estuary RSPB reserve in Cornwall. A section of the South West Coast Path runs along the estuary from Hayle Harbour to Lelant. There's tremendous views of Porth Kidney Sands and a visit to Griggs Quay to enjoy. The route starts in Hayle near to the train station and harbour. You soon come to the delightful Carnsew Pool where there is a circular walking trail around the water. You continue towards Lelant Water and RSPB Ryan's Field. Here you will find a lagoon with little islands where you can look out for a variety of birds. The next section takes you past Griggs Quay to Lelant where you have the option of continuing to Porth Kidney Sands. The reserve is wonderful for bird watching with 18,000 birds\u00a0including many wading birds, gulls and terns. Look out for teal, curlew, little egret and oystercatcher as you make your way around this stunning area. In Hayle you can also visit the Copperhouse Pool next to the harbour. There's a path along the Copperhouse Creek where you can get very close to the birds. National Cycle Route 3 passes the site so you can extend your outing by heading south to St Erth along the River Hayle. Walkers can continue west along the South West Coast Path to Carbis Bay and St Ives .",
