This very well prepared all weather walk that runs for about 1km along the river has about 80 fishing stations and is used for competitions several times a year as well as for regular recreational fishing by the locals. The walk proper starts several hundred metres from Portglenone bridge from a good sized car park which is signed off the A54 Bellaghy road. Alternatively, on foot this point can be reached along the bank of the Bann from the bridge though take note that this part of the walk can be muddy."
