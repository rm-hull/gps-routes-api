This very well prepared all weather walk that runs for about 1km along the river has about 80 fishing stations and is used for competitions several times a year as well as for regular recreational fishing by the locals. The walk proper starts several hundred metres from Portglenone bridge from a good sized car park which is signed off the A54 Bellaghy road. Alternatively, on foot this point can be reached along the bank of the Bann from the bridge though take note that this part of the walk can be muddy."

  "description": "This route takes you along the Fisherman's Walk in the village of Portglenone, County Antrim. The popular riverside trail runs along the River Bann where you can often see fishermen relaxing at their leisurely pursuit. Along the way their are benches where you can sit and enjoy the tranquil scene. The walk includes an optional detour into Glenone Forest which sits beside the trail on the western side. You can continue your walking in the area on the other side of the river in Portglenone Forest . There's some nice peaceful trails and lots of spring bluebells to enjoy in this small area of woodland.",
