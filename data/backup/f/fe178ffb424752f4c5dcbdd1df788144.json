  "description": "This interesting market town is located in north\u00a0Buckinghamshire, near to the borders of\u00a0Northamptonshire\u00a0and\u00a0Oxfordshire. It's surrounded by some lovely countryside with other highlights including the\u00a0River Great Ouse, the Grand Union Canal and the magnificent Stowe Park. This circular walk from the town takes you to the beautiful Stowe Park , just to the north east. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up footpaths running north through the countryside toward Chackmore.  Shortly after you come to Stowe where you can follow public footpaths around the perimeter of the site. On the way there are nice views across the historic parkland and woodland. For a fee you can access all of the grounds which are run by the National Trust. There are stunning gardens to see with other highlights including the Grecian Valley, the Gothic Temple, the Temple of Friendship and the Palladian bridge. On the western side of the park you'll cross the picturesque Oxford Water on an old bridge before returning to the town on Stowe Avenue.",
