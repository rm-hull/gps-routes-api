  "description": "This circular walk explores the pretty Hay Wood near Warwick in Warwickshire. You can start the walk at the car park area on Hay Wood Lane at the western side of the woods. From here you can pick up the peaceful woodland trails heading east into the site. There's a few easy trails to follow with lovely bluebells to see in the spring months and lots of woodland birds to look out for. Good footwear is required after rain as the paths can be quite muddy. The woods are located right next to the National Trust's Baddesley Clinton so it's easy to extend your walk if you have time. There's also the Heart of England Way , a long distance footpath running past the western fringe of the site.",
