  "description": "This circular walk explores Northumberland's Wark Forest in the wider Kielder Forest. The expansive forest has miles of peaceful walking and mountain bike trails. This route starts at Stonehaugh Picnic site where there is a small car park and camping site. The site is a good place to start a variety of walks in the forest. This route takes you north from the site to visit the Blacka Burn and Blackaburn Lough where there are good bird watching opportunities. You'll also pass Standard Hill and Capon Edge where there is a bridleway. The village of Wark lies just few miles to the east. There's some nice walks along the River North Tyne here.",
