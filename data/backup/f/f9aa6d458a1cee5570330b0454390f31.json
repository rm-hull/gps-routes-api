  "description": "Climb to the 796-metre-high (2,612 ft) summit of Mount Leinster on this challenging walk in the Blackstairs Mountains. The mountain is located on the border of Counties Carlow and Wexford, near the town of Borris. The walk starts from the Nine Stones car park, a landmark point at the foot of Mount Leinster on the L3005. You then follow a car free tarmac road to the summit where you will find a 2RN transmission site with a mast height of 122 m. There's also wide ranging views over the countyside of Wexford, Carlow, Kildare and Waterford. On a clear day you can see all the way to Wales. This is the easiest route to the summit, running for about 1.5 miles, so it's a 3 mile hike in total. Look out for wildlife including wild horses which can often be seen grazing on the hillside. To extend the walk you can continue east from the summit to East Top and Black Rock Mountain, the terminal peak of the eastern shoulder of Mount Leinster. The South Leinster Way also passes the mountain. The National Waymarked Trail runs for 104km from nearby Kildavin to Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary."
