  "description": "This circular walk takes you along the wonderful cliff top path in the village of Crosshaven in County Cork. The loop walk runs for just over 5km along a fairly flat trail. On the way there are glorious sea views over Cork Harbour and a visit to an coastal historic fort. The walk starts off in Crosshaven village and heads north east toward Camden Fort Meagher which was built to defend the mouth of Cork Harbour. You can explore this 16th century coastal stronghold that includes underground tunnels and an interesting World War I exhibition. The trail continues south past Grab All Bay and Weaver Point before coming to Church Bay Beach on Poulnacallee Bay. The final section then follows quiet roads inland to return to the village. To continue your coastal walking in the area head south west to try the popular Old Head of Kinsale Loop .",

The ancient castle is surrounded by some beautiful grounds and gardens with miles of footpaths to enjoy. To the northwest there's the circular Cork Marina Walk where you can enjoy fine views over the River Lee and a visit to the 16th century Blackrock Castle."
