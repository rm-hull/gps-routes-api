  "description": "This pretty Hampshire village is in a great spot for exploring the rolling Hampshire Downs and Hangers. This circular walk from the village visits the famous Watership Down and the neighbouring settlements of Sydmonton and Kingsclere. You'll also pass the excellent viewpoints at Ladle Hill and Nuthanger Down. Watership Down is located just south of the village on the Wayfarer's Walk long distance footpath. The down provides some splendid views over the area. The area was made famous by Richard Adams' 1972 novel and the subsequent animated film. Also on the walk is the Sydmonton Court estate, just to the south west of Ecchinswell. The estate consists of a 16th century Tudor manor house and is home to the summer arts Sydmonton Festival.",
