This is the best aspect although the BT Tower is also just visible in an ESE direction. The view to the north and west is totally blocked by trees. The new Wembley Stadium arch is just visible through the murk. This is possibly the closest OS Triangulation Pillar to central London."

Not a big hill, a knoll 86 metres high. It is above land of 30-60 metres elevation. It is well wooded but in some directions and up trees especially has extensive views. West can be seen Harrow on the Hill, south: Wembley Stadium and east: (over the vale of the Brent Reservoir which can be made out climbing trees) is Hampstead Heath in front of which are the hillside communities of Golders Green, Childs Hill and Frognal."

  "description": "Explore 103 hectares (254 acres) of rolling fields, hills and woodland in this country park and nature reserve in the London Borough of Brent. The walk starts in the car park at the eastern end of the park and follows footpaths to the top of Barn Hill. At the top of the hill there is a pond and great views towards Wembley Stadium and London. There are also two other hills with viewpoints, several other ponds and grazing ponies to see in this fine open space. Parking is available for about 50 cars but if you're coming on public transport you can catch the underground to Kingsbury Station on the Jubilee line. If you'd like to continue your walk you can follow the Capital Ring to the nearby Brent Reservoir for waterside trails.",
