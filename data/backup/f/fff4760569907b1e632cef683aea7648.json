  "description": "This circular walk explores the Afon Clywedog gorge near Dolgellau in Gwynedd. You can pick up the trail to the east of Dolgellau near the Torrent Walk campsite. The trail then runs along both sides of the rushing river through the attractive wooded gorge. On the way there's pretty waterfalls, weirs and some interesting rock formations to see. There's also the remains of old mills and a smithy, indicating the industrial past of the area. You can start the walk from the roadside parking area just off the B4416 to the east of the walk. Then pick up the trails heading west to Rose Cottage where there is a little stone bridge. Cross here and you can follow the footpath on the opposite side back to the car parking area. Along the way there's some interesting flora and fauna with otters, dormice, lichen and ferns to see. To continue your walking in the area you could try the popular Precipice Walk. The elevated path provides wonderful views over the Mawddach River and the surrounding mountains of Snowdonia. Near here there is also the New Precipice Walk which can be picked in the little village of Llanelltyd.",
