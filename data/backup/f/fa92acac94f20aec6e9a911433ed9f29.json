  "description": "This walk in the Lake District takes you from the village of Pooley Bridge to the wonderful Aira Force waterfall. The walk runs for just over 6 miles with some moderate hill climbs along the way. You can start off from the public car park at Pooley Bridge at the north eastern end of Ullswater Lake. You then head west, passing Dunmallard Hill before climbing towards Wreay and Bennethead. The walk continues south west into Swinburn's Park where there are some peaceful woodland trails and gills to see. This leads into Gowbarrow Park where you will pass Gowbarrow Fell with splendid views over the lake. At the western side of Gowbarrow Park you will come to Aira Force. The National Trust owned area includes the picturesque 65ft high falls and woodland trails with Himalayan firs, red squirrels and views of the Aira Beck. You can continue your walking in the area on the Pooley Bridge to Glenridding Walk which follows lakeside trails on the southern side of the water.",
