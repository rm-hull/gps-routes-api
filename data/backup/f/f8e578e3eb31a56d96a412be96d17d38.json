  "description": "The Watkin Path to the Snowdon summit is considered to be the most challenging of the available routes as it starts from the lowest elevation. It is, however, very pretty with attractive woodland and waterfalls near the start. You can start your walk from the good sized Nant Gwynant car park off the A498. Then if you head south over the Afon Glaslyn you will soon come to the start of the Watkin path on your right. You head north along the path, passing through woodland before a waterside stretch along the Afon Cwm Llan. You'll pass some lovely waterfalls before coming to the Gladstone Rock. The rock is dedicated to the Prime Minister William Gladstone, who opened the path in 1892. The path continues north from the rock with great views over the Glaslyn estuary and Llyn Glaslyn lake below. The next section from Bwlch y Saethau  is quite challenging with a very steep incline and loose stones. Shortly after you reach the summit where you are rewarded with magnificent views towards Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Lake District. There's several other routes across Snowdon to try. If you would like to do a circular walk then the Snowdon Horseshoe is a good option. For a longer but less demanding climb try the Llanberis Path . The beautiful Llyn Gwynant and Llyn Dinas are also very close to the start of this route. You could visit these two lovely lakes from the same car park. You can virtually climb to the summit using the google street view link below!",
