  "description": "This pretty Essex village has many picturesque features including a ford on the River Ter, an old windmill, a cricket pitch and cottages around Church Green. This circular walk from the village uses a section of the Essex Way and other country lanes to explore the area. The walk starts in the village centre and passes along the Cricket Green to Flack's Green. You then follow the waymarked Essex Way footpath north west to Sandy Wood and Fuller's Green. Pleasant country lanes then takes you north east to Fairstead where you pick up the Essex Way again. Follow it south and it will take you back to Terling.",
