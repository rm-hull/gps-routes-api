Built by the Normans on a hill above the town this was definitely a location for keeping an eye on the peasantry below!"

The M6 motorway can be seen winding through the left side of the picture, which gives some scale to the enormous buildings of Primepoint 14, a development that developers and planners assured local residents would not have any detrimental impact on the Stafford skyline!"

  "description": "Stafford is the county town of Staffordshire and has some nice waterside walking trail along the canal, river and nature reserve in the town centre. There's also some fine historic buildings including the\u00a012th century St Chad's Church and the Elizabethan\u00a0Ancient High House\u00a0which is notable as the largest\u00a0timber-framed\u00a0town house in England. This route starts near Stafford train station and head south west along public footpaths for about a mile to reach the historic Stafford Castle. The ancient Grade II listed castle is a prominent local landmark and one of the historic highlights of the area. From the elveated position of the castle you can enjoy fine views of Stafford and its surrounding countryside. The 26 acre castle grounds are a pleasant place for a stroll with woodland and a pretty herb garden to explore. Outdoor theate productions also take place in the castle grounds each summer. After exploring the castle the route follows alternative footpaths back towards the train station.",
