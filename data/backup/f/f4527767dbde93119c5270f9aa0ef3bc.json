  "description": "Explore the extensive, National Trust owned Styal Estate on this walk in Wilmslow, Cheshire. You can stroll along the River Bollin, through the peaceful woodland to the pretty Styal village. The cottages and barns of the village were built in the 1820s for the workers at Quarry Bank Mill. The cotton mill was built in 1784, and powered by Europe's most powerful working waterwheel on the banks of the River Bollin. Experts at the mill will provide you with an excellent history of the cotton industry and workings and machinery of the mill. You can also enjoy a stroll through the beautiful Quarry Bank gardens with caves, cliffs, trees, rhododendrons, a glasshouse and views across the river to the mill. Our Wilmslow Walk visits the estate from the town, following a river footpath through Carrs Park to the site. It's a nice way of visiting the estate if you are coming from Wilmslow train station or the town centre.",

      "content": "Just a few miles west of the park you'll find another excellent National Trust property in the shape of Tatton Park. The expansive park has miles of cycling and walking trails taking you to a lake and beautiful Italian and Japanese gardens. At the northern edge of the park there's also the lovely Rostherne Mere. The area is also a designated nature reserve where you can look out for a variety of wildfowl on the water. Part of the walk follows the Bollin Valley Way which can be followed toward Wilmslow or the Manchester Ship Canal at Partington. On the western side of Wilmslow you will find Lindow Common Nature Reserve. The small common is a nice place for a stroll with pleasant footpaths taking you around birch woodland and heathland. There's also lots of wildlife to see on the common's pretty lake.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
