  "description": "This circular walk from Ulverston takes you up to the Hoad Monument on Hoad Hill. It's a fairly short but quite steep climb with benches to rest on along the way if you need to. You can start the walk in the town centre and then follow footpaths north east past Town Bank and then up to the hill top which stands at a height of 436\u00a0feet/133 metres. Here you will find the distinctive 100\u00a0feet (30.5 metre) high tower at the top of Hoad Hill. The tower was built in 1850 to\u00a0commemorate the life and work of\u00a0Sir John Barrow\u00a0who was born in Ulverston in 1764. He is notable as a founding member of the\u00a0Royal Geographical Society, and held various government posts in the 19th century becoming the Second Secretary to the Admiralty. The monument is often referred to as the Ulverston Lighthouse though it has never functioned as one. It is something of a local landmark and a Grade II listed building. You can climb the tower's 112 steps and enjoy wonderful views of the Furness Peninsula, Morecambe Bay and the southern\u00a0Lake District. After taking in the views the route descends to the north west, passing the woodland of the Out Rake Plantation. You then head south west past Flan Hill to meet up with the Cumbria Way . You can then follow the waymarked footpath south through Gill Banks Woods and Lawyers Woods. Shortly after you return to the town centre where the route finishes.",
