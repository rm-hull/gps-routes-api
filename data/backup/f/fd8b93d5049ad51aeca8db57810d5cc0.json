Extensive quarrying of Dalkey Hill in the 19th century has resulted in the existence of Dalkey Quarry, which is now a rock-climbing location. Dalkey Hill and areas to the east and south of Dalkey Village were formerly the lands of Dalkey Common."

You can start the walk from the Killiney Hill car park and then follow trails up to the quarry where you can enjoy fine views over the city of Dublin. Head south from here and the paths will take you to the 140 metre high summit of Dalkey Hill. Here you can enjoy more wonderful coastal views over the Irish Sea to Wales.",
