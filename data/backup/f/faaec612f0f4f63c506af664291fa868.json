  "description": "The town of Lynton and village of Lynmouth sit side by side on the Exmoor coast in north Devon. It's a splendid place for walkers with a number of long distance trails passing through the beautiful area. As well as the wonderful coastal views there's also nice woodland trails and riverside paths along the East Lyn River. This 7 mile circular walk visits some of the highlights of the area using waymarked trails on good paths. Starting in the centre of Lynton you first follow a section of the South West Coast Path east towards the picturesque harbour village of Lynmouth. The path descends to the village which sits at the confluence of the West Lyn and East Lyn rivers, in a gorge 700 feet (210 m) below Lynton. You continue towards Countisbury where you can climb to Foreland Point Lighthouse at the most northerly point along the Devon and Exmoor coast. From here there are great views across the Bristol Channel to the Welsh coast. The route then descends back to the hamlet of Countisbury before coming to Watersmeet. The delightful area includes 2000 acres of river gorge and woodland with the opportunity for refreshments at the riverside tea garden at Watersmeet House. The walk then follows a section of the Tarka Trail back to Lynton. There's lots of good options for continuing your walking in the area. One of the highlights is the climb to the Valley of the Rocks. This dry valley contains the geological marvels known as the Lynton Beds. You could follow the South West Coast Path east and visit Culbone Wood and the delightful village of Porlock Weir. You could also follow the Two Moors Way and Tarka Trail south to the Cheriton Ridge in the Exmoor National Park. The Samaritans Way South West also passes through the area.",

      "content": "The Rising Sun is a fine choice for some post walk refreshments. It's a historic thatched pub of some note, dating all the way back to the 14th century. Inside there's a charming old interior with crooked stairways, narrow passages, sloping floors and low beams. There's also literary interest as R.D. Blackmore wrote several chapters of his novel Lorna Doone while staying in one of the inn's rooms during the 19th century (you can see more details on the Lorna Doone Walk which explores areas connected with the novel). The inn serves delicious sea food meals and also provides rooms with sea views, if you would like to stay in the area. It's located in a splendid spot next to the harbour in Lynmouth at postcode EX35 6EG for your sat navs. They are also dog friendly."
