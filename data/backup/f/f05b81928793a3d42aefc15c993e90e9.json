  "description": "Moors Valley Country Park and Forest, is situated in Ashley Heath, on the Dorset/Hampshire border. The park has a number of peaceful woodland paths so is a great place for a safe and easy cycle or walk. There are a number of well waymarked cycle and walking routes through the park, while there is also cycle hire available throughout the year. The park contains the Moors River and two Lakes where you can see Grey Herons, Great Crested Grebes, Mallards and Mute Swans. There is also a steam railway and a 'Go Ape' adventure park. Moors Valley is situated right next to Ringwood Forest so there is scope for continuing your ride for several miles through more peaceful woodland.",

      "content": "The Castleman Trailway skirts the southern edge of the park and offers a good opportunity for extending your exercise. The shared cycling and walking trail runs from Ringwood to Poole along the disused Southampton to Dorchester railway line. On the way it visits two other fine country parks in the area - Avon Heath Country Park and Upton Country Park. Also nearby is the town of Verwood. Here you can enjoy a walk around Verwood Forest, the Cranborne Common Nature Reserve and the Stephen's Castle Nature Reserve where there's a lovely viewpoint."
