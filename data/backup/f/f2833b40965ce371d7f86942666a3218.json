  "description": "This walk explores Storeton Woods in Birkenhead on the Wirral. The woods are located just south of Birkenhead and west of Bebington on the peninsula. You can start your walk from the on road parking on Rest Hill Road which disects the two sections of the woods. From here you can easily pick up some pleasant woodland trails which runs through the old sandstone quarry. You can see evidence of the old tramway used to transport the stone. A fossilised dinosaur footprint was also found in the quarry in the 19th century and later moved to Liverpool Museum. The site is great for wildlife too, with a variety of woodland birds to look out for from the trail.",
