To the south is the splendid Anderton Boat Lift. This remarkable feat of engineering is located on the Trent and Mersey Canal and is one of the highlights of the area. Just a couple of miles to the east you'll find Pickmere Lake. The pretty lake is a popular spot with swimmers and also has some nice footpaths along the southern side of the water. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
