It is now used for domestic supply and another compensation reservoir has been built down stream in the Jumbles."

There's an appealing interior with old beams, an open fire, numerous pictures on the wall, comfy chairs & a cosy, welcoming atmosphere. Outside there's a nice beer garden for warmer days. You can find it close to the train station on Overshores Rd with a postcode of BL7 0LU for your sat navs.  Pictured above are the Strawbury Duck Pub and the adjacent Entwistle Reservoir.
