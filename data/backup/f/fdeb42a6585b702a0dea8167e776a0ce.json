  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir near Bolton . There is a good footpath around the water which makes use of the Witton Weavers Way on the eastern side. The walk starts near Entwistsle railway station which can be reached from Manchester, Blackburn and Clitheroe. You then pick up the lovely path with waterside and woodland sections to enjoy. There are also great views of the surrounding countryside and the impressive Entwistle viaduct. To extend your walk you can head to the nearby Entwistle Reservoir or follow the Witton Weavers Way a mile south to Jumbles Country Park .",
