  "description": "This lovely reservoir in Fife has a nice 2 mile footpath running around the perimeter. You can park at the eastern side of the water, just off the A915 and then pick up the trail. There's splendid views across the water, some nice woodland sections and lots of wildfowl to look out for. The site is located near St Andrews and just a couple of miles south of Craigtoun Country Park. You can extend your walking here and visit the park's ruined temple, nature trail, Italian garden, greenhouses and formal gardens.",
