  "description": "This 16th-century tower house in Banchory is surrounded by 600 acres of formal gardens, woodland and rolling countryside. It's perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll with six waymarked walks of varying lengths. Highlights include a lovely walled garden with gravel paths, some marvellous topiary and wonderful specimen plants in herbaceous borders. To continue your walking in the area you could head east and visit the splendid Drum Castle. There's a series of nice trails to try here with woodland, an arboretum and a rose garden. Also in Banchory you can visit the wonderful Falls of Feugh where you can watch the salmon leaping up the cascade.",
