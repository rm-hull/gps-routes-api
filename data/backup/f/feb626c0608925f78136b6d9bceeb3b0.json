  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this pretty reservoir in the Quantock Hills area of Somerset. There's nice footpaths climbing above the reservoir, with lovely views across the water to the surrounding countryside and woodland. You can start your walk from the roadside parking area on Lawyer's Hill. Then follow the road and public footpaths towards Ebsley Cottage at the eastern end of the water. The path then climbs towards Littledown with nice views back down to the reservoir. To extend your walking in the area, head west to the Great Wood where you will find miles of waymarked cycling and walking trails. On the south western fringe of Great Wood you will find Wills Neck , the highest point in the Quantock Hills.",
