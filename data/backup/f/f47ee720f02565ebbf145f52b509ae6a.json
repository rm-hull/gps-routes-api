  "description": "This attractive Nottinghamshire market town has some nice waterside walks along the Chesterfield Canal and the River Idle which run through the area. In the town there's fine Georgian buildings, a spacious square and the interesting Mayflower Trail. On the trail you can learn about the Pilgrim Fathers, who originated from villages of Babworth and Scrooby on the outskirts of East Retford between 1586 and 1605. There's also the Mayflower Pilgrims Visitor Centre to visit in the town. This route from Retford makes use of the Chesterfield Canal towpath and the Trent Valley Way to create a circular walk around the town. On the way you'll visit the neighbouring villages of Clayworth and North and South Wheatley. There's nice waterside paths and some splendid views of the Nottinghamshire countryside to enjoy on the way. The walk starts on the canal just to the east of the tourist information centre and the bus station. From here you can pick up the towpath and the Cuckoo Way and head north towards Hayton and Clayworth. After passing through the village you head east to pick up the Trent Valley Way. Follow the waymarked trail south and it will take you through the countryside to the villages of North and South Wheatley. Here there's a number of 17th century brick houses and a noteworthy ruined church which dates from the 11th century. You then head south west along Muspit Lane and Howbeck Lane to Clarborough. Shortly after you rejoin the canal and follow it back into Retford.",
