  "description": "This walk visits the historic grounds of Kiplin Hall\u00a0in the\u00a0Vale of Mowbray area of North Yorkshire. The Jacobean House dates from the early 17th century and is a Grade I listed property. The expansive grounds are a lovely place for a walk with a lake, woodland, parkland, and beautiful walled and formal gardens. You can also explore the house and learn all about its history. Inside you can see the furniture, portraits, paintings and personal belongings of the four families who have owned the Hall the past 400 years. In February there is a popular snowdrop walk where you can enjoy carpets of the pretty white flowers. To continue your walking in the area head a mile north west to visit Ellerton Lake . There's some nice waterside trails and lots of wildlife to see at the adjacent Bolton-on-Swale Nature Reserve.",
