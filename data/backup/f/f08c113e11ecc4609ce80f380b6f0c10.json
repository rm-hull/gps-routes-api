  "description": "A circular walk from Edale visiting Jacob's Ladder, Edale Cross, Mount Famine, Rushup Edge and Lord's Seat. The Jacob's Ladder path is a series of stone steps located at the start of the Pennine Way in the Peak District. It's a challenging climb but you are rewarded with fabulous views at the top. The walk starts from the train station in the popular village of Edale and follows a country lane north to Grindsbrook Booth at the start of the Pennine Way. Follow the path west to Upper Booth before the steep ascent along Jacob's Ladder. You continue past Edale Cross before descending to Coldwell Clough and Higher Heys Farm where you pick up the Pennine Bridleway. Follow it south east past Mount Famine to Rushup Edge where you turn east. The route then passes along the ridge with magnificent views in all directions. You'll pass Lord's Seat at 550 m (1,804 ft), the highest point on Rushup Edge. After descending Lord's Seat you have the option of climbing up to Mam Tor but this route turns north to Cold Side before returning to Edale. Jacob's Ladder is located on the fringes of Kinder Scout. You can extend your walk by climbing to this popular hill summit.",
