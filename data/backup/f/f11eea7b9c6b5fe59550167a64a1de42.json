  "description": "This walk visits a fascinating ancient site near Skryne in County Meath. The atmospheric area was once used as the inauguration place and seat of the High Kings of Ireland. The site also has strong associations with Irish mythology and has uncovered many archaeological gems over the years. You can start the walk from the parking area just to the north of the site. Then follow footpaths south past St Patrick's Parish Church to the Rath of the Synods and the Mound of Hostages. Here you can explore the ancient ceremonial and burial sites which are considered to be some of the most significant archaeological sites in Ireland. From the hill there are also excellent views over the surrounding countryside. The Hill Of Tara is located about 43km north west of Dublin, so should take just under an hour in the car.",
