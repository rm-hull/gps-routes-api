  "description": "This walk visits a fascinating ancient site near Skryne in County Meath. The atmospheric area was once used as the inauguration place and seat of the High Kings of Ireland. The site also has strong associations with Irish mythology and has uncovered many archaeological gems over the years. You can start the walk from the parking area just to the north of the site. Then follow footpaths south past St Patrick's Parish Church to the Rath of the Synods and the Mound of Hostages. Here you can explore the ancient ceremonial and burial sites which are considered to be some of the most significant archaeological sites in Ireland. From the hill there are also excellent views over the surrounding countryside. The Hill Of Tara is located about 43km north west of Dublin, so should take just under an hour in the car.",

      "content": "Head north and you could try the Boyne Valley Walk. This waterside route explores the lush green countryside of the River Boyne Valley, taking you from Navan along the canal towpath to the ancient site of Knowth. On the way you will also pass another local historic highlight at Slane Castle. The castle grounds include a whiskey distillery, woodland trails and a natural amphitheatre which has been used for many concerts. Just to the east of Slane Castle is the site of the famous Battle of the Boyne. The area includes an excellent visitor centre and a number of walkways taking you around the site of the historic 17th century battle. There are also pretty gardens and walks along the River Boyne and the Boyne Canal. You can reach the site from nearby Drogheda by following the Drogheda Boyne Greenway west from the town. The shared cycling and walking trail utilises sections of boardwalk and riverside paths along the River Boyne to reach the battlefield. It's a pleasant way to reach the site without a car.  Just to the west is the medieval Trim Castle where there are some pleasant grounds and more riverside trails."
