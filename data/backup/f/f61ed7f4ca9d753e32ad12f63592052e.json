  "description": "This delightful Cheshire based village is a lovely place for a stroll. There's picturesque old cottages, a mid 19th century watermill, canalside trails and some historic local castles to see. This walk from the village takes you to the Bunbury Locks on the Shropshire Union Canal. The route then goes on to climb to the splendid viewpoint at Beeston Castle which lies just to the west of the village. You can start the walk in Bunbury and follow country lanes north to link up with the canal at the impressive staircase locks. Follow the towpath west to Tiverton and Wharton's Bridge where you can pick up the popular Sandstone Trail. This can then be followed south to climb to the 13th century castle where you can enjoy some wonderful views over the Cheshire Plain. From this elevated ancient spot you can see across eight counties from the Pennines in the east to the Welsh mountains in the west. You can extend the walk by continuing south to visit Peckforton Castle and Peckforton Hills .",
