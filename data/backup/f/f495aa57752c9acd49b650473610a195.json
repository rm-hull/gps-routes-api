  "description": "Harrow on the Hill village is an interesting place for a walk in Greater London. The historic area includes the 11th-century St Mary's Church and Harrow School, one of the most famous public schools in England. You can enjoy a stroll around the churchyard of the elevated church which sits atop Harrow Hill. From here there are fine views over the city of London with visible landmarks including Canary Wharf, the BT Tower in Warren Street, and Wembley Stadium. The Grade I listed church is the highest building in the historic county of Middlesex. Footpaths will then take you through the village and past the school's old buildings and grounds. The Old Schools date back to 1615 and are Grade I listed. In the area there's also antiquarian shops, Victorian cottages and many other notable old buildings to admire. To stretch your legs further head to the nearby Harrow Weald Common or Fryent Country Park which lies just to the east.",
