Its sole purpose now is as a unique leisure and wildlife facility for the enjoyment of locals and the many visiting hill walkers. Pendle can be seen on the distant skyline."

  "description": "This circular walk visits the Gaddings Dam reservoir near Todmorden. The spot is something of a hidden gem with a secluded beach and wonderful views from its elevated position on the moors. You can start your walk from the roadside parking area opposite the Shepherd's Rest Inn on the Lumbutts Road. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south to the reservoir. There's a circular path running around the lake with some excellent views across the moors to Pendle, the Calder Valley and the surrounding hills. The site was created in the 19th century to provide water to the mills of Lumbutts village which lies just to the north east. There is also a small beach at the reservoir which is said to be the highest beach in the country. It's a lovely little tranquil spot to have a paddle in the summer months. The route then heads north west to Rake End, passing the Basin Stone, an unusually shaped rock formation on the way. At Rake End you can pick up the Pennine Bridleway and follow it east back to the car park and the pub. You could extend the walk by heading east to Lumbutts village and visiting a series of other reservoirs. Alternatively head less than a mile south to Warland Reservoir where there's a longer waterside path to enjoy.",
