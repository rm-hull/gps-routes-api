  "description": "Explore the Goodrich Castle estate before climbing to Coppet Hill on this walk in Herefordshire. There's fascinating history, woodland trails and great views from the high points to enjoy. You can start the walk from the Goodrich Castle car park. First explore the ruinous Norman medieval castle described by Wordsworth as the 'noblest ruin in Herefordshire'. Then follow the footpaths south through Goodrich before climbing Coppet Hill. The hill is also a nature reserve with woodland and lots of wildlife. Look out for butterflies, deer and a variety of birdlife. From the high points of the hill you can see the Brecon Beacons, the Clee Hills and the Malvern Hills. You can use the google street view link below to virtually explore part of the castle grounds and see the great views you get of the surrounding Herefordshire woodland and countryside. To extend your walking in this lovely area you could pick up the Wye Valley Walk and enjoy a waterside walk along the River Wye. Follow the river south east and it will take you towards Welsh Bicknor, Lower Lydbrook and the Forest of Dean. Eventually you will come to Symonds Yat Rock where there are woodland trails and wonderful views over the Wye Valley. Near here is the mysterious King Arthur's Cave which is also worth a visit. The castle and hill are located a few miles south of Ross-on-Wye. You could follow the riverside path from the town as an alternative route.",
