The cursus, now ploughed out in most sections, is a double embankment running for 10km from Thickthorn Down to Pentridge. Thinking is that it was a ceremonial track."

There is a real layering of different ages here with neolithic, bronze-age and Roman."

It has been conjectured that cursus were used in rituals connected with ancestor veneration, that they follow astronomical alignments or that they served as buffer zones between ceremonial and occupation landscapes. Evidence also suggests they may have been used for ceremonial competitions and a proving ground for young men involving a journey to adulthood."

  "description": "This circular walk visits the Dorset Cursus in the Cranborne Chase AONB. The historic area includes several long barrows, tumuli and wonderful views over some beautiful countryside and woodland. As well as exploring the ancient site the walk also climbs to Gussage Hill and visits the village of Gussage St Michael. Start the walk from the parking area on Wyke Down at the eastern end of the cursus. Then head south west past Down Farm, following the course of the cursus towards Cashmoor. The Neolithic earthwork enclosure comprises parallel banks spanning over 6 miles of chalk downland. The route then heads south to visit the small village of Gussage St Michael. The village includes a Grade I listed church with parts dating to the 12th century. From here you head north east to climb to Gussage Hill. The hill stands at a height of 117 metres providing excellent views right across the cursus. You then follow a bridle path past Harley Wood before returning to the car park.",
