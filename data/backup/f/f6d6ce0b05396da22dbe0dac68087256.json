  "description": "This village near Nottingham has some fine riverside trails and two fine local country parks to visit. This walk from the village takes you along the popular Cliff Walk which runs along the River Trent to the Rockley Memorial Park. You can start off near the train station where you can pick up the Trent Valley Way and follow the riverside path north along the Cliffs. It's a nice wide path which is accessible for buggies, wheelchairs and mobility scooters. Along the way you will pass the Rockley Memorial Park which is dedicated to local men who died in the Great War. It's an attractive park to explore with rhododendrons, azaleas, landscaped lawns and wonderful towering trees. The path also passes the impressive Stoke Weir and Lock at the village of Stoke Bardolph. There's a nature trail on the opposite side of the river here. The walk can be extended by continuing along the Trent Valley Way to Shelford and Fiskerton where there are several million pound properties and a fine riverside pub.",

      "content": "Head west along the river and you could explore Holme Pierrepont Country Park and Colwick Country Park near West Bridgford. Here you'll find a nature reserve, a number of lakes and the National Watersports Centre. Just to the east there's the neighbouring town of Bingham where you can try the Bingham Linear Walk. The pleasant route runs along a disused railway line through the town and then out into the countryside where there are views of the River Smite. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nottinghamshire Walks page."
