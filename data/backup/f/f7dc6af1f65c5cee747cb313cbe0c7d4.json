The fourteenth-century church predates Claydon House by around 400 years but that did not stop the 2nd Earl Verney building his mansion very close to it. The very corner of the guttering of the house can just be seen as a dark mark against the blue sky on the left edge of the photograph. In fact the lawned area that now lies between the church and the house was once a graveyard, the removal of which was ordered by the Earl. The church is still the parish church of Middle Claydon and does not belong to the National Trust."

This is the Middle Lake of the three."

These outbuildings, presumably a former stable block or a carriage store or just an entrance portico, are to the east of the main Claydon House but facing towards it across a courtyard enclosed on three sides. Even such a utilitarian building demanded embellishment and here a clock turret surmounted by a cupola and an ornate weathervane complete the edifice. Although it is not easily visible in this view the date of 1754 has been picked out in black bricks between the two side windows. This would imply that it just predated the commencement of the building of the main house in 1757. As ever it is good to report that the clock was telling the right time!"
