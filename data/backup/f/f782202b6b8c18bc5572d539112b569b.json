Along the riverbanks, you\u2019ll find a mix of alder, willow, and ash trees, which help stabilise the soil and provide shade to the river. Wetlands and floodplain meadows feature plants like meadowsweet, yellow flag iris, and marsh marigold, which thrive in damp conditions. During spring and summer, woodland sections of the trail are carpeted with bluebells, wild garlic, and primroses, while hedgerows are adorned with hawthorn and blackthorn blossom. Wildflowers such as cow parsley, red campion, and dog violet can also be seen alongside the path, supporting pollinators."

The River Bollin and its surrounding habitats attract a variety of wildlife. The river itself is home to brown trout, grayling, and dipper birds, which can often be seen bobbing along the river\u2019s edge. Kingfishers are another highlight, their flashes of blue visible as they dart over the water hunting for fish. Mammals like otters and water voles may occasionally be spotted in quieter sections, while the woodlands provide shelter for badgers, foxes, and various species of bats. Birdlife is abundant, with buzzards, woodpeckers, and nuthatches commonly seen or heard in the trees. Insects such as dragonflies, damselflies, and butterflies like peacock and comma are active near the water and wildflower meadows during warmer months."

      "caption": "Glaze Brook enters the Manchester Ship Canal. Here, on the border between Cheshire and Salford, the Manchester Ship Canal receives the waters of Glaze Brook (also known as the River Glaze). The Glaze drains a substantial area of mossland hereabouts and was the boundary between the ancient Lancashire Hundreds of West Derby and Salford. This latter fact is recorded on the wall of a bridge near here that carries the A57 road over the Glaze, but as the wall is made of sandstone the lettering is wearing away.This part of the Ship Canal is a canalised section of the River Mersey. The Mersey joined the canal a little way upstream of this point (to the left) and will leave the canal a little further downstream, close to where the River Bollin joins the canal."

  "description": "Follow the River Bollin from Macclesfield to Partington on this delightful waterside walk through Greater Manchester and Cheshire. The walk starts at the Macclesfield Riverside Park and follows the river through Prestbury, Wilmslow, Hale and Bowdon to Partington on the Manchester Ship Canal. On the route you will pass the 18th century Grade II listed Mottram Hall and National Trust owned Dunham Massey. This Georgian House is set in a magnificent 121-hectare (300-acre) deer park and boasts Britain's largest winter garden. As well as the River Bollin there are also views of the Bridgwater Canal and a short final section along the Manchester Ship Canal into Partington.",
