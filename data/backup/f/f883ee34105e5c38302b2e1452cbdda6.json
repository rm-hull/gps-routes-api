  "description": "This Lancashire mill village is located near Ramsbottom and Rawtenstall on the rivers Irwell and Ogden. You can visit the village on the East Lancashire Railway, a fine heritage railway with the historic steam trains. It's a very appealing place for walkers with river trails, nearby lakes and miles of footpaths across the expansive moorland to the west. The village itself is also very pretty with terraced mill cottages, a gothic architectural church, and old textile mills to see. This circular walk from the village visits some of the local highlights including Calf Hey Reservoir, Holden Wood Reservoir, Ogden Reservoir, Holcombe Moor, Musbury Tor and quarry, the old railway and the River Irwell. The trail uses sections of the Rossendale Way long distance footpath for much of the walk. On the way you'll enjoy waterside trails along the rivers and lakes, and some excellent views over the area from the elevated moorland which is owned by the National Trust. At the northern end of the walk you can extend your exercise by further exploring the lovely Haslingden Grane .",
