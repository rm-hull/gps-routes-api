  "description": "This Cumbrian village is located in a remote and scenic spot in the North Pennine AONB. Local walking highlights include the waymarked South Tyne Trail. This long distance riverside trail can be followed along the river south to Tyne Head where you will find a sculpture marking the source of the river. To the east you can explore the Nenthead Mines and visit the heritage centre where you can learn all about the lead and zinc mining history of the area. For cyclists the village is located on the epic Coast to Coast Whitehaven to Tynemouth cycle route. Garrigill is a popular place for a pit stop along this epic trail. This short walk from the village takes you south along the South Tyne Trail to visit Ashgill Force waterfall. Along the way there are lovely views of the rushing river before coming to the photogenic falls. It's a lovely spot with the 55 feet high falls and a number of smaller cascades to see on the way.",

      "content": "Back in the village head to The George & Dragon Inn for some post exercise refreshment. The historic building dates back to 1611 with the pub opening in the early 1800s. They serve good quality home cooked food and have a good selection of ales. Inside there's a cosy interior with flagstone floors and wood burners. There are also picnic tables outside where you can relax with a lovely view of the village on warmer days.  In 2023 the pub underwent an extensive restoration project. You can find the inn at postcode CA9 3DS for your sat navs."
