  "description": "Located near the boundary between County Waterford and County Tipperary you'll find the beautiful Vee Gap. Positioned in the dramatic surroundings of the Knockmealdown Mountains it provides a vantage point looking over onto the Galty Mountains further north. You can start the walk from The Vee car park at the southern end of the pretty Bay Lough . The walk then follows a section of the Tipperary Heritage Way , a waymarked long distance trail running through the area. Follow it north and it will take you past Bay Lough before turning east through Bohernagore Wood where you can see some beautiful Rhododendrons. You continue east along pleasant woodland trails before reaching the V-shaped turn on the road after which The Vee Gap is named. You'll reach a height of around 2,000 feet (610m) with wonderful panoramic views over the surrounding mountains and countryside. On a clear day the Vee affords views along and across the valley to Clonmel , Cahir, Ardfinnan, Clogheen, Ballyporeen and even Cashel. The route then heads north to Goaterbridge and finishing in Ardfinnan where there's a fine old bridge over the River Suir.",
