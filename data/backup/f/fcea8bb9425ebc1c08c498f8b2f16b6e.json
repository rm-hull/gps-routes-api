In this view the path is quite high above the Lagan (well hidden in the valley to the right), close to the entrance from the towpath near the Red Bridge."

  "description": "This large park in Belfast has some nice woodland trails and views of the River Lagan which runs right through the forest. It is unusual to find a working forest within a city so the area is well worth a visit. The woods have a number of waymarked trails to try with lots of woodland wildlife to look out for. There are also interesting historic sites including the 12th century Norman motte and Ice House. You can start your walk from the forest car park, off Belvoir Drive. From here you can directly pick up the trails through the woodland, meadows and along the river. To extend your walk simply follow the Ulster Way and the Lagan Towpath along the Lagan to the nearby Lagan Valley Regional Park. The Lagan Towpath will take you through the Lagan Valley to Lisburn. You're also very close to the splendid Lady Dixon Park which includes more nice footpaths taking you to the arboretum, the Azalea Walk, fountains, a walled garden and a delightful a Japanese-style garden with pretty water features.",
