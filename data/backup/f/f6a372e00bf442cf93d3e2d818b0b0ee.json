  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Loch Morie in the Scottish Highlands. It's a lovely peaceful place with a well marked and easy to follow track. You can start the walk from the country lane at Bouth where you can pick up the Loch Morie Track. Follow it north west and it will take you to the loch where there's a trail running along the western side of the lake. From here you can enjoy splendid views across the water to the surrounding forest and mountains. To continue your walking in the area head west to visit Loch Glass .",
