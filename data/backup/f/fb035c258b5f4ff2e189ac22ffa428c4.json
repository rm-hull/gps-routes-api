This is the area where one of those streams, Mimmshall Brook, goes underground through a series of swallow holes. The whole site is an SSSI."

  "description": "This fine Hertfordshire based village is known for its BBC transmitters, excellent golf course and 18th century Folly Arch. For walkers there are some pleasant trails around the golf course and the Gobions Wood Nature Reserve. The reserve is located just south of the village an includes footpaths taking you around a pond and peaceful ancient woodland. In the spring months there are lots of bluebells to see. Also look out for a variety of wildlife including blackcap, chiffchaff and buzzards. The circular walk takes you through the reserve and then south to visit the historic folly arch which dates back to the 1700s. The route then continues west to North Mymms and Water End where you can enjoy views of the local brook and the River Colne.",
