  "description": "The Yorkshire Wolds village of Brantingham has a number of waymarked trails running through the area. This circular walk makes use of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, the High Hunsley Circuit and the Beverley Twenty to take you on a tour of the countryside to the east of the village. You'll visit some of the local wolds and dales with some peaceful woodland sections and a visit to the village of Welton. It's a lovely rural setting with some beautiful scenery to admire. The walk starts in Brantingham which is very pretty village with an attractive green and duck pond in the centre. From here you head east along the Beverley 20 to Turtle Hill. You then turn south, passing attractive Wauldby where there's a manor farm, a church, a pond and some pockets of woodland. The route then heads along the Wolds Way through the woodland of Welton Dale to the village of Welton. It's a picturesque village with a mill pond and village green with a memorial fountain. There's also an 18th century mill and a the Green Dragon Pub which is a nice place to stop for refreshments. After exploring the village you head north west through Elloughton Wold and Elloughton Dale before a short woodland section takes you back into Brantingham. To extend your walking in the area follow the Wolds Way south to the River Humber where you can pick up the Trans Pennine Trail and visit Humber Bridge Country Park near Hull. Here you can enjoy a walk across the Humber Bridge to Barton Upon Humber or pick up the Hessle Foreshore Walk which takes you along the attractive river bank to Hull.",

This includes a visit to the historic 17th century pub said to have been a favourite haunt of highwayman Dick Turpin. Just a few miles to the north east you'll find the worthy village of Skidby. The main attraction here is the Grade II listed Skidby Mill which dates back to 1821. The working mill includes an interesting museum and a fine restaurant with a landscaped garden. Head a few miles north west and you'll find North Cliffe Woods. The bluebell woods are a pleasant place for a peaceful stroll with lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Wolds Walks page."
