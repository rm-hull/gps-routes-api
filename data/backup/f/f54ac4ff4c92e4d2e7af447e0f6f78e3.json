  "description": "This walk climbs to Graig Fawr hill near Dyserth and Prestatyn in North Wales. The National Trust estate is located just to the north east of Dyserth. You can start the walk from the car park near Castle Quarry and follow footpaths north to the hill top which stands at a height of 153 metres (502 feet). From here there are some excellent views north to the coast around Prestatyn. There's also good views towards the surrounding hills of the Clwydian Range . The hill is surrounded by woodland and limestone outcrops that rise up steeply, above the little village of Meliden. Both the Offa's Dyke Path and the North Wales Path pass the hill. You could pick up these waymarked trails to extend the walk if you have time. Head north east and you could visit the Prestatyn Hillside Nature Reserve where there are some peaceful woodland trails and good wildlife spotting opportunities.",
