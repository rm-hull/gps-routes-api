  "description": "This pretty country park is located in Newcastle Under Lyme, Staffordshire. It has safe, family cycle paths and well maintained walking trails taking you around the open grassland landscape. There is a large pond which attracts great crested newts, a plateau with lovely views of the surrounding countryside, farm meadows, wilidlife conservation areas and woodland areas. The Newcastle Way walk runs past the park so you could continue your walk along this long distance path. The adjacent Apedale Country Park is also a good option if you would like to continue your outing.",
