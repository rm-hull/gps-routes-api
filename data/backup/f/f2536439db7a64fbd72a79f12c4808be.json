  "description": "This Cheshire based town has some nice waterside walks along the two canals and the river which flow through the area. The attractive town has a number of interesting historical buildings including a noteworthy 12th century church and a Roman Theatre. It is also home of the annual folk and boat festival, the Roman and Norman festivals, and regular farmers' markets. This walk from the town takes you along the Dane Valley Way and the Trent and Mersey Canal to the neighbouring town of Northwich where you can visit the lovely Marbury Country Park. The walk starts on the Trent and Mersey Canal in the town centre. Here you can pick up the Dane Valley Way and follow the waymarked footpath north along the River Dane and the canal. You'll pass Harbutt's Field, Whatcroft, Rudheath, Wincham, Marston and Dairy House Meadows before coming to Marbury Park in Northwich. The park contains magnificent Lime avenues, an Arboretum and the delightful Budworth Mere near Great Budworth. Pickmere Lake also lies just to the east. To the south there's also the Anderton Nature Park, Carey Park and the splendid Anderton Boat Lift. This remarkable feat of engineering is located on the canal and is one of the highlights of the area",

There's a charming interior with a bar built in the shape of a narrowboat, closely resembling the one at The Shroppie Fly at Audlem. There's also a nice garden area outside where you can sit and watch the boats go by on a summer day. You can find them on 1 Booth Lane with a postcode of CW10 0JJ for your sat navs."

      "content": "To continue your walking from the town you could pick up the Middlewich Arm of the Shropshire Union Canal. It will take you south west to Church Minshull. The town is also notable as the home of the Wardle Canal. It is the shortest canal in the country with a length of 154 feet (47 m). Just east of the town you could visit neighbouring Winsford. Here you can enjoy another waterside walk along the canalised section of the River Weaver on the Weaver Way. The popular Whitegate Way also starts/finishes in Winsford. The shared cycling and walking trail follows a disused railway line north to Cuddington. A car park and the old station can be found at the Winsford end. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
