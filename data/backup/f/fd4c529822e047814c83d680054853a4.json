  "description": "This elevated ridge in Swaledale is a popular place for walkers. The craggy ridge rises to a height of 1,552 feet (473 m) with some tremendous views over the surrounding Yorkshire Dales. This circular walk takes you up to Fremington Edge from the village of Reeth where car parking is available. From the village head north west to cross the Arkle Beck and then head north west through lovely Arkengarthdale to Castle Farm and Fleggs House. Here you turn north east to climb up to Fremington Edge Top where you will soon come to the high point on the ridge. Follow the paths south east across the ridge past the disused radio mast to New Close Bank. Here you pick up a country lane to descend to Reels Head and High Fremington. Soon after you cross the beck again to return to Reeth. Much of the route takes place bridle paths so is also popular with mountain bikers.",
