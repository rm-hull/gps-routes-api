  "description": "This pretty coastal village sits justs to the north of Torquay in Devon. The area is still largely rural making it a fine place for a walk away from the busier parts of Torbay. This walk from the village takes you south to visit Watcombe Beach and Oddicombe Beach. On the way there's some wonderful red sandstone cliffs and some classic local views from the high points. The walk starts from the car park next to the beach where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it south to Shackley Beach, Watcombe Head, St Marychurch and Oddicombe. It's an interesting area with the rare Babbacombe Cliff Railway which will take you down to the secluded beach. There's also the Babbacombe Model village and some fine cliff top views to enjoy here.",
