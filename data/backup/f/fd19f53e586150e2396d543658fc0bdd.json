  "description": "This delightful circular walk in Goathland visits the beautiful 70 ft high Mallyan Spout waterfall in the North York Moors National Park. The walk starts from the parking area in the pretty village of Goathland and heads west along a country lane for about half a mile. You then follow a footpath north to the waterfall. You continue through a peacefull wooded valley along West Beck to Beck Hole on the Murk Esk River. The route then returns to Goathland along the track bed of the original Whitby to Pickering railway line. The walk has some lovely waterside sections and splendid views of the surrounding North York Moors to enjoy. If you enjoyed this walk then you could head to the nearby Falling Foss Waterfall for more lovely woodland trails. It's another highlight of the area with a 30ft high waterfall and a delightful old tea room. You could also continue along the rail trackbed to Grosmont on the Grosmont to Goathland Rail Trail. Our Goathland Circular Walk also visits the falls directly from the village centre. It then climbs to the hills above Goathland for wonderful views over the moors.",

The hotel includes a restaurant, bar and a new coffee shop which offers homemade cakes, light snacks, afternoon teas, barista coffees, speciality milkshakes and more. Additionally the hotel has some beautiful gardens surrounding the Grade II listed former country house. It's a lovely place to visit on fine days. You can find the hotel in the village at a postcode of YO22 5AN for your sat navs. Opposite the hotel you'll also find the historic Goathland Parish Church. It's built on a site which has celebrated worship for many hundreds of years; a sign of the history of the village. You could also head north into the pretty little village of Beck Hole where you'll find The Birch Hall Inn. The charming old pub has a lovely garden area overlooking the river. The pub also doubles up as the village shop so you can pick up some extra supplies here too. You'll find them on Beck Hole Road at postcode YO22 5LE for your sat navs."

      "content": "The falls are a great place for a dog walk but it's best to keep them on leads in areas where there are livestock. The area near the falls can be quite slippy so please take special care here of yourself and your pet. It is probably better to have them off lead in these areas. The Mallyan Spout hotel mentioned above is also dog friendly."
