  "description": "This delightful circular walk in Goathland visits the beautiful 70 ft high Mallyan Spout waterfall in the North York Moors National Park. The walk starts from the parking area in the pretty village of Goathland and heads west along a country lane for about half a mile. You then follow a footpath north to the waterfall. You continue through a peacefull wooded valley along West Beck to Beck Hole on the Murk Esk River. The route then returns to Goathland along the track bed of the original Whitby to Pickering railway line. The walk has some lovely waterside sections and splendid views of the surrounding North York Moors to enjoy. If you enjoyed this walk then you could head to the nearby Falling Foss Waterfall for more lovely woodland trails. It's another highlight of the area with a 30ft high waterfall and a delightful old tea room. You could also continue along the rail trackbed to Grosmont on the Grosmont to Goathland Rail Trail . Our Goathland Circular Walk also visits the falls directly from the village centre. It then climbs to the hills above Goathland for wonderful views over the moors.",
