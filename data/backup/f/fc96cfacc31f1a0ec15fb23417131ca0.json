This is not the original site of this 17th century packhorse bridge which was further downriver at the former Derwent village (to the South), but the construction of the Ladybower dam in the mid 20th century meant that Derwent village would be submerged beneath the waters of the new reservoir. The bridge (a scheduled ancient monument) was therefore dismantled and the stones numbered and put into storage for a number of years before it was reconstructed in 1959 at the new site which is shown in the photograph."

  "description": "This circular walk visits Derwent Reservoir, Howden Reservoir and the old packhorse bridge at Slippery Stones in the Derbyshire Peak District. The walk starts at the Fairholmes car park, at the southern end of Derwent Reservoir. From here you head north along the reservoirs and woodland to the Slippery Stones bridge at the northern end of Howden Reservoir. It's a scenic and historic spot with the 17th century bridge is a reminder of the former Derwent Village which was 'drowned' in 1944 when the Ladybower Reservoir was created. There's nice views of the River Derwent which can be followed north onto the Howden Moors. It's also a popular spot for wild swimming in the beautiful crystal clear waters.",
