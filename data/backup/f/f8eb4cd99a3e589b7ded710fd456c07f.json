  "description": "Explore 188 acres of lovely parkland near Burgess Hill in East Sussex. The park trails pass oak trees, grassland, a lake and a stream. Many different birds visit the park including stonechats, linnets, woodpeckers, chiffchaffs, and blackcaps. In the spring months the area is a draw for walkers as it's covered in carpets of bluebells. Cycling is permitted through the park along the bridleways but all of the paths are open to walkers. There is a car park on Folders Lane at the southern end of the site. From here you can pick up the trails heading north across the common. Burgess Hill train station is about a mile to the west if you prefer to visit by public transport.",

There are great views over the Low Weald from this popular viewpoint. On the northern side of Burgess Hill there's the Bedelands Nature Reserve to explore. The wildlife rich reserve includes bluebell woodland, wildflower meadows, grazed meadows, a lake and a waterfall. For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks page."
