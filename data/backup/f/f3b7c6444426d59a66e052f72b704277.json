  "description": "This walk takes you along the lovely Northumberland coast from Druridge Bay to Amble. It's about a 4 mile walk, passing along scenic beaches with fine coastal views throughout. The route is pretty flat so suitable for most abilities. The walk starts from the car park at Druridge Bay Country Park. From here you head north along a section of the Northumberland Coast Path to Hauxley Nature Reserve where there's some good wildlife watching opportunities. Keep your eyes peeled for heron, redshank, tree sparrow, reed bunting, bull finch, coot, moorhen and curlew. You might also see red squirrels, stoats and otters in this area. Soon after Hauxley you pass the Sand Dunes at Amble before arriving at Amble village. You can extend the walk by picking up the Amble to Warkworth Walk which continues north to nearby Warkworth.",
