  "description": "Enjoy wonderful coastal views on this circular walk around the popular North Wales town of Llandudno. The walk visits the wonderful limestone headland of Great Orme and the lovely Conwy Sands. It's a special part of the country with wonderful geology, archaeology and wildlife. Start the walk from Llandudno train station and head east towards the coast. Here you can enjoy a stroll along the promenade where you will pass the Grade II listed pier. The impressive 19th century structure is the longest pier in Wales at 2,295 feet (700\u00a0m). You can then follow the coast path around the Great Orme headland with the option of exploring the myriad of trails within the country park. There's lots of pretty wildlflowers to see in the summer months. Also keep your eyes peeled for the Kashmiri goats grazing on the slopes of the headland. On the western side of the town you can enjoy nice views over Conwy Bay and visit the sand dunes of Conwy Sands. The walk uses a section of the North Wales Path long distance trail. You can extend your walking by continuing south to Conwy where you can enjoy a climb to Conwy Mountain . It's another lovely area with lots of pretty heather and wonderful views over the mountains of Snowdonia. Heading east will take you to Great Orme's little brother - Little Orme .",
