  "description": "This attractive Somerset based town has a fine 17th century market square and some outstanding architecture to enjoy. The town is notable as having given its name to the county. It was around the start of the 14th century, the county town of Somerset. For walkers there's some lovely country footpaths to explore the surrounding area and pleasant waterside trails along the River Cary to the north of the town. This walk from Somerton takes you to one of the highlights of the area at Lytes Cary. You'll also visit the neighbouring villages of Kingsdon, Charlton Adam and Charlton Mackrell. The walk starts in the town and heads east along the Macmillan Way West to Somerton Erleigh and Somerton Wood before passing through Kingsdon Wood. Here you head south to enter the village of Kingsdon. From the village you can follow country lanes to Lytes Cary. This National Trust owned manor house includes lovely grounds with beautiful gardens, attractive topiary, ponds and ornate statues. After exploring the house you head north to Charlton Adam where you pick up the Macmillan Way West again. You can follow the waymarked footpath west past Charlton Mackrell before returning to Somerton.",
