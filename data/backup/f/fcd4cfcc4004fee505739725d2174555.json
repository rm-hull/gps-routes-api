  "description": "This Buckinghamshire based village has some fine country walks into the surrounding Chiltern Hills. There's also a worthy local nature reserve and a fine village pub to investigate. This circular walk from the village visits Bledlow Wood, Chinnor Hill, Radnage and the Yoesden Wood Nature Reserve. There's some lovely rolling hills, peaceful woodland trails and wonderful views from the high points on the trail. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north to Rout's Green and the local farmland. The route then pick up a section of The Ridgeway and follows it to Hempton Wainhill. You then head south past Thickthorne Wood and Bledlow Great Wood before coming to Chinnor Hill. This area is also a nature reserve and provides excellent views over the surrounding area. The route then follows footpaths past Sunley Wood and Hedgerley Wood before coming to the neighbouring village of Radnage. Here you'll pass Yoesden Wood before returning to Bledlow Ridge. The Yoesden Wood nature reserve is a nice place for a stroll next to the village. There's chalk grassland with rare butterflies and wild flowers and a woodland of beech, yew and whitebeam trees. It's located less than half a mile west of the village at postcode HP14 4AR.",
