This 45 acre park boasts woodlands, a wildflower meadow and an apple\norchard. Also at Shenley you will find the Shenley Cricket Centre with its 19th century pavillion designed by W.G Grace. The path then heads to London Colney , joining the River Colne which leads you to the picturesque Colney Heath and then onto the finish point at Smallford, near St Albans and Hatfield Park .",
