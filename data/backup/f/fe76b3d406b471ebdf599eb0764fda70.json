The Calder and Hebble originally had a Halifax Branch, rising through 14 wide locks from Salterhebble Junction on the Main Line, over 1 mile 6 furlongs to Halifax Wharf. Most of this closed in 1944, leaving just this short arm which is seen looking back towards Salterhebble from the A629 road bridge."

  "description": "This circular walk around Halifax explores the waterways and woods to the south of the town. Start the walk from the train station and then head south along the Hebble Way which takes you along the Hebble Brook. This will lead you to the Halix Arm of the Calder and Hebble Navigation Canal where you can pick up the towpath and head east. It's a nice flat footpath with good views of the River Calder and the surrounding countryside of Calderdale. The path passes along the edge of Elland Park Wood which is a nice place to see bluebells in the springtime. Just before you reach Brighouse you can leave the canal, picking up the Calderdale Way. This long distance, waymarked trail will take you north west through Cromwell Wood and Upper Exley before returning you to the canal. You can then follow the same waterside paths north to return to Halifax town centre and train station. To continue your walking around Halifax head north west of the town to visit Ogden Water where there's a nice footpath running around the reservoir. It is actually at the opposite end of the Hebble Brook which forms part of this walk. To the east of the town you will find Shibden Park. There's some lovely trails here taking you to a beautiful mere, a Wilderness Garden, cascades and pools, woodland and a fruit garden with a collection of heritage fruit trees.",
