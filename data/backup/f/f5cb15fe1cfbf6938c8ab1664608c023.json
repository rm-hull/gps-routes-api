  "description": "This route from Rye uses two of the area's long distance footpaths to create a circular walk around the town. You'll follow sections of the 1066 Country Walk and Saxon Shore Way waymarked trails to visit the lovely Rye Harbour, the ruins of Camber Castle and the nearby town of Winchelsea. The route starts near the train station in the town and heads south along the River Brede to the Martello Tower and the nature reserve. Here you will find a wide range of habitats including saltmarsh, lagoons, grazing marsh, shingle and reedbeds. Keep your eyes peeled for wildlife including ringed plover, avocet, oystercatcher, redshank, lapwing, and sandwich terns. The path also passes close to the noteworthy Camber Castle. You can visit the interesting ruins of this 16th century Device Fort, built by Henry VIII to protect the Sussex coast against French attack. The trail bends round to the west to visit the small town of Winchelsea which makes a great place to stop for refreshments at one of the pubs or cafes. In the town you pick up the 1066 Country Walk to take you along Cadborough Cliff back into Rye. The final section crosses the pretty River Tillingham and the Rye Windmill before returning to the town centre. To extend the walk you can pick up the Royal Military Canal Path and enjoy some easy waterside walking to the Sussex Coast.",
