  "description": "This country park on the outskirts of London has 413 acres of rolling meadows, brooks, lakes, ancient woodland, and historical sites to explore on foot or by bike. The wide variety of habitats in the park attracts an abundance of wildlife - look out for Muntjac deer, rabbits and pheasants. In the woodland areas you can see great crested grebe, kingfisher, hobby, treecreeper, nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker while the two large lakes attract geese, swans, mallard ducks and mandarin ducks. Also in the park is the Grade II listed Trent House, surrounded by statues, lime trees, an obelisk, a Japanese water garden, an Orangery and the Camlet Moat. This scheduled Ancient Monument first appeared in local records in 1440. Trent Country Park is located in Enfield close to Cockfosters tube station on the Piccadilly Line. The London Loop runs through the park so you could pick up this trail and head to the nearby Whitewebbs Country Park. The park has an ornamental pond, woodland trails, small lakes and pretty streams to enjoy.",
