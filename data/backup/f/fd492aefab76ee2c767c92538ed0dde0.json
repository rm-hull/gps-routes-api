A fortified two-storey hall was added in the 16th century, along with crenellations. With the Laffin estate covering a relatively small area of 86 hectares (210 acres), it suggests that alternative sources of income, such as fishing or trade, likely financed the castle's construction. Following the 1641 Rebellion, the Laffins relinquished control of Slade. Subsequently, the castle was utilized for storage by the salt works until the 19th century, when it was repurposed into tenement housing. Upon its acquisition by the Office of Public Works in the 1940s, efforts were made to restore the castle to its original state. The oldest segment of the castle is the four-storey tower, featuring vaulted ceilings on the ground and third floors. The parapet is adorned with Irish-style crenellations, offering strategic views of Bannow Bay and Waterford Harbour. The entrance door is safeguarded by a machicolation and murder-hole. Additionally, a fireplace and garderobe remain intact on the second level. The three ground-floor chambers, inaccessible from the living quarters above, may have served as storage facilities. The hall stands at two storeys in height, its entrance fortified with a murder-hole. Positioned at the west end is a sizable fireplace, while the south wall houses an oubliette. Access to the upper floor is via a mural staircase."

Towards the southern region of the townland, remnants of an earlier ringfort are evident. The harbour within Slade village underwent expansion during the mid-19th century, utilizing piers that trace back to at least the 17th century. A salt-house was erected in the 17th century for the purpose of preserving fish landed in the harbour.

Constructed 800 years ago by Knight William Marshal, you can immerse yourself in history with a guided tour where you'll hear stories of medieval life and the duties of a light keeper. Then marvel at the breathtaking vista from the balcony, with vast stretches of sea unfurling in front of you. The lighthouse is among the most captivating examples of medieval architecture in Ireland. The tower rises to a height of four stories, boasting walls measuring up to 4 meters in thickness. The structure comprises three rib-vaulted chambers in the lower tier, while the upper, narrower segment was designed to accommodate the warning beacon. These two levels are linked by a mural stairway concealed within the wall, consisting of 115 steps. Constructed from local limestone, the original edifice remains fully intact. The first tier spans a diameter of 13 meters at its base and encompasses three stories, each featuring its authentic 13th-century stone fireplace. Within the wall's thickness, several mural chambers are embedded, including two garderobes (toilets). The upper tier, measuring 6 meters in diameter, initially supported the beacon fire, which was later substituted by the lantern. In times of dense fog, fog signals were activated at the lighthouse to alert seafarers, a crucial measure before the advent of radar and radio. Fog guns positioned at the cliff edge were discharged every 10 minutes, eventually replaced by explosive charges set from atop the tower on an extending arm. Ultimately, a compressed air horn (hooter) emitted a blast every 45 seconds during foggy conditions."

      "caption": "View from the top of Hook Head Lighthouse. The existing tower originates from the 12th century, although legend has it that Dubh\u00e1n, a missionary in the Wexford region, established a primitive form of beacon as early as the 5th century. The headland is referred to in Irish as Rinn Dubh\u00e1in, meaning St. Dubh\u00e1n's Head. However, the similar-sounding Irish word 'du\u00e1n' translates to a fish hook, hence the English name. It is commonly known locally as \"the Hook.\" The tower was erected by William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, who was Strongbow's son-in-law and succeeded him as Lord of Leinster. Pembroke had founded a port in the town of New Ross, approximately 30 km upstream. In order for his new port to thrive and for ships to safely navigate their course, Pembroke commissioned the construction of a 36m high tower at the mouth of Waterford Harbour. Although the precise year of construction remains uncertain, Pembroke first arrived in the region in 1201, and the earliest map depicting the lighthouse fulfilling its function dates back to 1240, indicating that construction must have occurred between these periods. The initial guardians of the light were a small group of monks whose modest monastery was located on the peninsula. These monks would have regularly lit warning fires and beacons over the years to alert sailors to the perilous rocks on the peninsula. It was these monks residing at the monastery in the 13th century who became the inaugural light-keepers. They are also believed to have assisted in the tower's construction."

      "caption": "County Wexford Hook Head Lighthouse Keeper's House. The monks vacated the tower, and in the mid-17th century, they were succeeded by the inaugural lighthouse keepers. In 1671, a new lantern, still fueled by coal, was installed atop the tower, replacing the old beacon light. The coal fire was eventually discontinued in 1791, when a whale oil-lantern, measuring 12 ft. in diameter and equipped with 12 lamps, was put in place. This arrangement persisted until 1871 when new gas lights, fueled by gas produced in the enclosure known as 'the gas yard', were installed. During the 1860s, three residences were constructed for the lighthouse keepers. Paraffin oil became the new power source in 1911, and a clockwork mechanism transitioned the light from a fixed to a flashing mode. This mechanism required winding every 25 minutes by the keeper on duty. Finally, in 1972, electricity became the primary power source, and light-sensitive switches were incorporated to control the lantern. In March 1996, The Hook Lighthouse underwent conversion to automatic operation, and the last light-keepers, who had diligently ascended the stairs and tended to the light, were permanently withdrawn from the station. The lighthouse is now remotely managed from D\u00fan Laoghaire by the Commissioners of Irish Lights. In 2001, the lighthouse was opened to the public as a tourist attraction after the former keepers' residences were transformed into a visitor centre. In January 2011, The Hook's fog horn sounded for the last time as all the fog horns were deactivated. It was deemed that the technology on modern ships had advanced to such an extent that the fog horn was no longer deemed necessary. In June 2011, the structure claimed the top spot in a Lonely Planet feature listing the \"Top 10 Flashiest Lighthouses\"; the author hailed Hook as \"The great granddaddy of lighthouses\"."
