  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside surrounding the 14th century Old Wardour Castle in Tisbury, Wiltshire. The site is managed by English Heritage who provide an audio tour where you can learn about the castle's history. You can also climb the turrets for wonderful views over the surrounding area. Start the walk from the castle car park before exploring the ruin and the beautiful landscaped grounds. You can then pick up a section of the Wessex Ridgeway long distance footpath to take you up to New Wardour Castle. The Palladian style house was built in the 18th century for the Arundell family. Follow the trail toward Wardour where the path curves round through Wardour Park. You'll pass a series of ponds and a small wooded area near Park Gate Farm. Here you pick up the Wessex Ridgeway again to take you between Heron Pond and Pale Park Pond before returning to the castle car park. To extend your walking in the area you could follow the Wessex Ridgeway north to the splendid Fonthill Estate. There's miles of lovely trails to follow here through woodland and along the large Fonthill Lake. Just to the north east is Dinton Park where there's more nice scenery surrounding a Neo-Grecian house.",

      "content": "The circular Tisbury Walk visits the castle from the nearby village. The picturesque settlement is well worth a visit with quaint old cottages, a 12th century parish church, an ancient yew tree, a 17th century pub and a Grade I listed Tithe Barn to see. Just to the south west is the pretty village of Compton Abbas where you can visit Fontmell and Melbury Downs, Compton Abbas Airfield and the highest point in the Cranborne Chase AONB at Win Green Hill. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cranborne Chase Walks page."
