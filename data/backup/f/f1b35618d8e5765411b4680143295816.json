  "description": "This market town in County Durham has some nice riverside trails, local country parks, nature reserves and woodland areas to explore on foot. It's located on the River Tees near to the towns of Darlington , Hartlepool and Middlesbrough . Stockton is notable for having the broadest High Street in England and an old market place with a 18th century Town Hall and Market Cross. This short walk in the town visits the pretty Billingham Beck Valley Country Park on the north eastern side of the town. You can start the walk from the visitor centre car park and pick up the footpaths taking you to wildflower meadows, reed-beds, ponds, marsh and woodland. It's a great place for wildlife with birds such as grey heron, kingfisher, snipe, sedge warbler, coot and moorhen attracted to the wetland areas. To continue your walking around the town head south and visit the Tees Barrage . Here you can also pick up the riverside Teesdale Way , a waymarked long distance walking trail. For a sample walk in the town centre see the video below. This visits some of the historical and architectural highlights of the town. At the start you can see the Stockton Flyer, a popular art installation in the town centre. People gather round to watch the sculpture rise from within a stone plinth at 1 p.m. every day. It moves emits smokes, and sounds a whistle. The piece is a stylised depiction of the Locomotion No. 1, which first arrived in Stockton in 1825, and, as part of the Stockton and Darlington Railway had a large impact on the town.",
