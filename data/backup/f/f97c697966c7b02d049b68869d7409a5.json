  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll around these beautiful gardens in Sheffield. The gardens have miles of lovely paths to follow through the extensive grounds. The gardens cover 19 acres with 5,000 species of plants, manicured lawns, ornate fountains and the Grade II listed glass pavilions. Highlights include the Herbaceous walk with stunning herbaceous borders on both sides of the path. The plants and trees are set out in displays from the continents they come from with information boards to explain them. There is a nice cafe to relax in after your walk. To extend your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Endcliffe Park. Here you'll find a lovely woodland trail along the picturesque Porter Brook. If you'd like to reach the gardens by bike then National Cycle Route 6 will take you there from the city centre. It also runs on to Endcliffe Park so it's easy to visit both in one day.",
