  "description": "Visit the spectacular Falls of Glomach on this walk in Kintail. The falls are one of the highest in Britain, with a drop of 113 m (370 ft). You begin at the car park at the National Trust for Scotland Morvich countryside centre and follow waterways to Dursduain Wood. Here you follow peaceful woodland footpaths through the forest before the final stretch to the falls which involves a steep climb. It's a fabulous, challenging hike with wonderful views of the Kintail mountains and the awesome gorge and waterfall at the end of the climb. Just to the north of the falls you can extend the walk by visiting the tranquil waters of Loch na Leitreach.",
