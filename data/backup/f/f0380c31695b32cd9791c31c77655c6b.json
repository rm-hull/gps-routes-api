  "description": "This walk takes you from Reighton Sands to Filey along the long stretch of beach between the two settlements. It's about 3.5 miles, passing along the beautiful Filey Bay with splendid coastal views throughout. The walk starts from the car park at Reighton Gap. From here you can follow footpaths down to the beach and head north west along Reighton Sands, Hunmanby Sands, Muston Sands and Filey Sands. The walk finishes on the sea front in Filey but you could extend the walk to visit the nearby Filey Brigg Country Park where there are more excellent views from the cliff tops.",
