  "description": "This popular Perthshire village is located in a fine spot at the western end of Loch Tay in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. This walk from the village takes you along a section of the old railway. On the way you will pass the Killin Viaduct and enjoy some fine views of the River Dochart and the historic Finlarig Castle. Start the walk near the Falls of Dochart where there's a pub and car parking available. From here you can pick up a trail heading north east over the river Dochart to the Bridge of Lochay. On the way you will also cross another bridge over the River Lochay before coming to the photogenic ruins of Finlarig Castle. The trail is also suitable for cyclists. You'll also pass close to the western edge of Loch Tay where there are more waterside walking and cycling opportunites. To continue your exercise along the old railway pick up the Killin to Callander route which will take you west through Glen Ogle to Loch Earn and Callander.",

The inn has some history too, dating all the way back to the 1700s when it was previously a blacksmiths. You can find the inn at postcode FK21 8SL for your sat navs."
