  "description": "This walk explores the ancient oak woodland of Strid Wood on the Bolton Abbey Estate in the Yorkshire Dales. The woods include pleasant walking trails along the River Wharfe with waterfalls, countryside views and pretty bluebells to admire during the spring months. The Strid itself is a natural marvel, where the river abruptly narrows, forcing the water through with great pressure. It was created by the erosion of softer rock through the circular motion of small stones in depressions. On the walk look out for wildlife including roe deer, otters, kingfisher and greater spotted woodpecker. There are footpaths on both sides of the river so you can create a circular walk around the woods if you wish.",
