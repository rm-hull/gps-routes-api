  "description": "This walk visits the Coed Taf Fawr and a series reservoirs near Merthyr Tydfil. The visitor centre here is considered the southern gateway to the Brecon Beacons National Park. There are lots of good walking paths and mountain bike trails to try here. The walk starts from the car park and visitor centre located at the northern end of Llwyn-on Reservoir. From here you can pick up the waymarked Taff Trail andf follow it north along the river to Cantref Reservoir. The walk then continues north to visit the pretty Beacons Reservoir. You then turn south to return to the forest where you pick up other woodland trails to take you back to the visitor centre. There's also a number of other waymarked paths in the forest including the Willow Walk all ability trail and a sculpture trail with wonderful wooden carvings. The waymarked mountain biking trails have different grading levels for varying abilities. All the trails start from the car park.",
