  "description": "This small Welsh village is located in Conwy County near Denbigh and St Asaph . The village is notable for several historic buildings including a Grade I listed church and a 17th century public house. This walk from the village takes you up to the Mynydd y Gaer hill fort and the Plas Uchaf Reservoir. The hill fort can be reached by following footpaths north from the village. From the 295-metre-high summit there are excellent views over the surrounding countryside and back down to Llannefydd village. Ona clear day you can also see the mountains of Snowdonia, the Clwydian Range, Mynydd Hiraethog, Blackpool Tower and the Cumbrian hills. Just south west of the hill you'll also find the picturesque Plas Uchaf Reservoir where there are some nice waterside trails with views over the water to the hills.",
