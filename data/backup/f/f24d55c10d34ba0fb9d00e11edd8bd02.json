  "description": "Enjoy a lovely stroll through the Londesborough Estate on this short walk near Pocklington, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The estate of Londesborough was created by the third Earl of Burlington in the 17th century and was also one of the seats of the Dukes of Devonshire. The hall was demolished in 1819 but the surrounding parkland and some remnants of the old buildings still remain. In the park you'll find some lovely countryside with cattle and horses to look out for in the fields. There's also pretty streams, pockets of woodland and two small lakes with the Upper Lake joining the larger Lower Lake via a stream and small weir. It's a delightful place for walkers with good public footpaths and the Yorkshire Wolds Way passing right through the estate. You can start the walk from the car park just to the south of the park, near Goodmanham. Then head north along the paths which will take you around the eastern side of the lake to Londesborough village. After exploring the village you return by crossing the lake on the Wolds Way and returning to the car park. The estate is located just a couple of miles north of Market Weighton. If you prefer you could start the walk from there and follow the Wolds Way all the way to the park. To extend your walk you could continue north along the trail and visit Nunburnholme and Millington Woods. If you head south you can pick up the Market Weighton Canal and enjoy a waterside walk to the Humber Estuary.",
