Much of the terrain consists of marram-covered dunes, and the local council has had to undertake various measures throughout the years to combat coastal erosion."

One of the earliest churches in Sligo, it was founded by Bishop Br\u00f3n mac Icni (d. 512) a contemporary of St. Patrick.  This church was a major pilgrimage site that contained a relic of St. Patrick known as the Fiacail P\u00e1draig, now in the National Museum of Ireland. According to Patricks biographer Tirech\u00e1n in his Collectanea, Patrick prophesied that the sea would force his heirs to move closer to the river Sligo, now the Garavoge. The present building dates to the 12th century. The church was the victim of Viking attack, perhaps the same expedition that assaulted Inishmurray. It is the subject of an ongoing preservation initiative by the Killaspugbrone Preservation Society."
