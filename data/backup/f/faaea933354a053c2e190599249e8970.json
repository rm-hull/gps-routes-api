One of the earliest churches in Sligo, it was founded by Bishop\u00a0Br\u00f3n mac Icni\u00a0(d. 512) a contemporary of\u00a0St. Patrick. \nThis church was a major pilgrimage site that contained a\u00a0relic\u00a0of St. Patrick known as the\u00a0Fiacail P\u00e1draig, now in the\u00a0National Museum of Ireland.\u00a0According to Patricks biographer\u00a0Tirech\u00e1n\u00a0in his Collectanea, Patrick prophesied that the sea would force his heirs to move closer to the river Sligo, now the Garavoge. The present building dates to the 12th century. The church was the victim of Viking attack, perhaps the same expedition that assaulted\u00a0Inishmurray. It is the subject of an ongoing preservation initiative by the Killaspugbrone Preservation Society."
