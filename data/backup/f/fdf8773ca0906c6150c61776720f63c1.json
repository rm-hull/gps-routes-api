  "description": "Enjoy an easy waterside walk around this pretty lake in the Cheshire village of Lymm. The beautiful still waters of the lake are surrounded by attractive woodland with well maintained paths to follow. There is usually plenty of roadside parking around the dam and an ice cream van for refreshments. Start the walk by the Dingle near the canal and then head south to follow the 1 mile path around the water. You could also continue south along the woodland trails along the Bradley Brook to extend the walk. The Cheshire Ring Canal Walk and the Mersey Valley Timberland Trail both run to the north of the dam. You can easily pick up these trails to explore the Bridgewater Canal around the village. Heading west will take you to nearby Warrington, while heading east will take to Altrincham via the splendid Dunham Massey. There's some lovely trails to try here with a magnificent deer park, a 17th century mill and the tranquil Island and Smithy pools. See the Canal Walk Lymm to Dunham Massey page for more details.",
