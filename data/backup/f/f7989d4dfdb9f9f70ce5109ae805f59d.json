  "description": "Travel from Welwyn Garden City to Hertford along a disused railway line on this easy cycle or walk in Hertfordshire. The route follows National Cycle Network Route 61 on a flat, traffic free path. There's nice tree lined sections and views of the surrounding open countryside. The route starts on the outskirts of Welwyn Garden City and runs through Letty Green before finishing at Hertford. The route links with the Ayot Greenway at Welwyn Garden City. It's a similar rail trail which runs to Wheathampstead along National Cycle Route 57. The Alban Way also runs from nearby Hatfield to St Albans. Walkers can pick up the Lea Valley Walk and enjoy a riverside stroll. See the St Albans Cycle Routes page for more rides around the area. See the National Cycle Route 61 page for details of the full route which runs from Maidenhead to Hoddesdon.",
