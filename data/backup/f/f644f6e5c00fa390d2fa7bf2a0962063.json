  "description": "This walk takes you through the woodland and gardens surrounding this mansion in Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, Anglesey. The house is situated on the Menai Strait so there are fabulous views across the water towards Snowdonia. Woodland trails take you to a pretty rhododendron garden, while there is also a spring garden and Australasian arboretum with an an italianate-style summer terrace. You can also explore the house which was\u00a0Lord and Lady Anglesey's family home. It contains Rex Whistler's largest ever painting and fine 1930s furniture. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Anglesey Coast Path which runs past the house. Penrhyn Castle is also not far away and has 60 acres of beautiful grounds to explore.",
