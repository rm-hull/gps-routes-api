  "description": "This Norfolk based village is located on the outskirts of Norwich just south of the University of East Anglia on the River Yare. It's a good place to start a walk with three long distance waymarked paths passing through the area. This walk from the village follows part of the Yare Valley Walk to the man made broad at the nearby University of East Anglia. There's a boardwalk running through the site which will take you along the river to Cringleford Wood and the lake. You can start off just to the east of Cringleford Bridge where there's a car park and a public footpath just off Eaton Street. It's a lovely place for a nature walk with lots of wildlife to look out for along the water. If you were to head south along the Yare Valley Walk it would take you to the Marston Marshes where you will find a waymarked circular nature trail with lots of wildlife to see. To continue your walking in the area you could follow Ketts Country Walk and the Tas Valley Way south to visit the neighbouring village of Swardeston which lies just to the south. Here you can link up with the Hethersett and Swardeston Country Walk which will take you west to nearby Hethersett.",

There's a charming interior with Dutch gables, beams, panelled walls and inglenook fireplaces. Parking is available and there's also a large garden to relax in on warmer days. You can find them at postcode NR4 7LD for your sat navs."
