  "description": "Enjoy a walk around the beautiful Solva Harbour on the Pembrokeshire Coast. There are good walking trails on the east and west side of the harbour with the rocky headland of the Gribin giving wonderful views of the coast and St Bride's Bay. There are also great views of the River Solva and of the pretty Solva beach. This walk starts from the car park and follows good footpaths to the Gribin on the eastern side of the harbour. At the Gribin summit you will find an Iron Age fort and really wonderful views of the harbour and the coast. You can descend to the pebble beach at Gwadn where you may see breeding chough. After returning to the village you could stop for refreshments at the lovely Harbour Inn which has outdoor tables overlooking the river. The walk then continues along the western side of the harbour where there is more lovely scenery. If you would like to continue your walk you could pick up the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and head east towards Newgale on the Solva to Newgale Walk. This section of the path passes two impressive headlands with great views out to Green Scar Island and Ramsey Island. The Solva to St David's Coastal Walk will take you west to the city of St David's, starting from the harbour. It's another lovely section of the coast with highlights including the ruins of St Non's Chapel and the purple sandstone cliffs at Caerfai Bay.",
