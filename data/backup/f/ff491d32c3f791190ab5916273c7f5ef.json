  "description": "This walk visits Horseshoe Lake near Yateley and Sandhurst in Berkshire. The site consisits of working gravel pits that have now been flooded to form an Activity Centre with various water activities and open water swimming. There's also nice footpaths for walkers along Horseshoe Lake and the adjacent Grove Lake and Moor Green Lakes Nature Reserve. Just north of here you can access the National Trust's Finchampstead Ridges where there's some nice woodland trails, pretty ponds and lots of wildlife. The River Blackwater also flows past the series of lakes on the Three Castles Path. The long distance trail provides an opportunity for further exploring the area on a good, waymarked trail. On the walk look out for water loving birds including the Great White Egret, Reed Warbler, Bittern and the rare Black-winged stilt which has been spotted around Moor Green Lakes. Birds of prey such as Marsh Harrier and Hobbies can been seen too. There's also lots of pretty wildflowers where butterflies such as Brimstone, Small Tortoiseshell, Peacock, Comma and Red Admiral can be seen fluttering around. To continue your walk you could head east for more waterside walks around Tri Lakes Country Park. To the south there's peaceful woodland walking and cycling trails around Yateley Common Country Park .",
