  "description": "This circular Peak District walk visits the prehistoric Carl Wark and Higger Tor on the eastern moor of the Dark Peak. It's quite a challenging walk reaching a height of 434 m (1,424 ft) at Higger Tor. From the high points there are splendid views over the Peak District landscape. Start the walk from the parking area off the A6187 near Burbage Bridge. From here you can pick up the footpaths heading north onto Burbage Moor. The route continues along the Burbage Rocks to Upper Burbage Bridge where you turn south. You pass along Fiddler's Elbow before reaching Higger Tor where there's a number of strange grey gritstone rocks. You continue south across Hathersage Moor where you will soon reach Carl Wark. The photogenic rocky promontory is faced by vertical cliffs on all but one side, which is protected by a prehistoric embankment. It stands at a height of 370 metres (1,214 ft) above sea level and is approximately 230 metres (750 ft) long and 60 metres (200 ft) wide. After exploring Carl Wark the route continues south to the car park, passing another interestingly shaped rock at Toad's Mouth on the way. To continue your walking in the area head north west to the nearby Stanage Edge. The stunning gritstone escarpment is one of the highlights of the area. For an alternative route the tor see our Hathersage Circular Walk which starts and ends from the village.",

It starts from the Upper Burbage Bridge Car Park which is located at the northern end of the rocks. It will take you up to the rocks before returning along the pretty brook with its interesting old packhorse bridge. The brook runs south into the National Trust's Longshaw Estate where there are miles woodland and country trails to try. Eventually it comes to the splendid Padley Gorge which is another walking highlight of the area. The Sheffield Country Walk passes just to the east of the tor. The circular long distance trail is a great way of extending your walking in the area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
