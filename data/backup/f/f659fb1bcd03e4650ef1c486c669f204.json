  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Trull Waterfall near Taunton in Somerset. The falls are something of a hidden gem with pleasant trails and a viewing bridge at the site. You can find the waterfall on the eastern side of the village of Trull. Here there are some nice footpaths along the Sherford Brook leading to the pretty falls and bridge. After admiring the falls you can continue south along the East Deane Way to visit Poundisford Park and neighbouring Pitminster. There is an old stone bridge and another waterfall to see on this section of the path.",
