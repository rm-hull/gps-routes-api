  "description": "Crakehall is located in the Hambleton District of North Yorkshire. It is separated into Great Crakehall and Little Crakehall by the Bedale Beck, a tributary of the River Swale. This walk runs between Great Crakehall and the popular town of Bedale to the south. You can follow the pavement along the A684 road between the two villages and enjoy fine views of the surrounding countryside. It's about a 2 mile walk along a fairly flat roadside path. At the southern end of the walk you can extend your outing along the lovely Bedale Beck in Bedale. Scroll down the page for a list of other walks near and around the village.",
