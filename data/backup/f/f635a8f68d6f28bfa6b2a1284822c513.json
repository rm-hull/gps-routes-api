  "description": "This small Derbyshire town is located close to some classic Peak District walks, with stunning scenery in all directions. This circular walk takes you from the town to Combs Reservoir where there are nice trails running along the water and the Meveril Brook. You can extend the walk by heading north and climbing Eccles Pike .  From here there are fabulous views over the Peak District towards Windgather Rocks, Combs Edge, Combs Reservoir, Cat\u2019s Tor and Shining Tor . At the summit you will find a topograph which shows all the sights you can see from the top. The popular climb to Chinley Churn is also just to the north of Eccles Pike and offers more great Peak District views. To the west of the town you'll find Whaley Bridge and Toddbrook Reservoir which has some nice trails to try. This includes the Midshires Way long distance footpath which runs past the reservoir. To the east of the village you can pick up the Pennine Bridleway long distance trail and follow it towards Jacob's Ladder and the epic Kinder Scout .",
