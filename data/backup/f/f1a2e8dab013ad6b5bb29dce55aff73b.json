  "description": "A walk around the beautiful Basildon Park near Reading. There are 4 different waymarked trails through the 400 acres of parkland and woodland that surround the 18th century mansion house. The walk also takes you through the beautiful garden with its maze, wildflower meadows and rose garden. The route also passes very close to Beale Park Wildlife Park and Gardens which are well worth a look. Here you'll find collections of small exotic animals, farm animals and birds, landscaped gardens and woodlands, and children's play areas. You will also pass very close to the River Thames so the walk can be continued along the river too. Heading east will take you towards the pretty village of Pangbourne where you can visit the delightful water meadows and enjoy a stroll along the River Pang .",
