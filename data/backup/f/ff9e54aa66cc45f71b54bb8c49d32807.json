Thus, easy level walking.\nThe railway opened in 1898 and was closed to passenger traffic in 1960. A section between Newbury and Welford remained open for freight traffic to\u00a0RAF Welford\u00a0until 1972. Steam railmotors and a GWR diesel railcar were used on the line, as well as steam engines owned by the Lambourn valley Railway, and Great Western Railway standard engines."

  "description": "Travel from Oxfordshire into Berkshire along the Lambourn Valley Way and enjoy woodland, parkland and a series of quaint towns and villages. The walk starts at the Bronze age fort at Uffington Castle and the distinctive prehistoric Uffington White Horse hill figure. From here you head south across the Lambourn Downs before following the River Lambourn through Lambourn, Boxford and Speen before a lovely stretch along the Kennet and Avon Canal takes you into Newbury . Here you could visit Donnington Castle which lies just off the route. The medieval castle is surrounded by attractive farmland and peaceful woodland. It's a nice place to stop for a picnic and learn about the history of the area.",
