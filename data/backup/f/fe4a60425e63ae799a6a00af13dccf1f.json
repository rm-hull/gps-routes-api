  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Groby Pool and Sheet Hedges Wood near Leicester. There's a large free car park on the southern side of the pool off Newtown Linford Lane. From here it's a short walk to the pool where you can see a variety of birds on the water. There's also some peaceful woodland with bluebells in the spring months. After passing the pool you can continue north into the adjacent Sheet Hedges Wood where there are some additional trails to explore. You can continue your walking in the area by heading just a mile south west to visit Martinshaw Wood. The woodland trust owned wood has some nice trails with lots of birdlife to see. The popular Bradgate Country Park is also just a short walk north of the site.",
