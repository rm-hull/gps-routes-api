  "description": "This large RSPB nature reserve near St Ives has some nice walking trails and a cycle path running through it. The reserve consists of a series of lakes, ponds and lagoons with the River Great Ouse running through the northern section. There's lots of well laid out trails taking you around and between the lakes with National Cycle Route 51 running through the central section along the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway. The reserve is a haven for water loving wildlife with huge numbers of ducks, swans and geese on the lakes in winter.  Also look out for terns, hobbies, lapwings, coots and a variety of dragonflies. You can extend your walk by picking up the Ouse Valley Way which runs through the reserve. If you head west it will take you into St Ives and then onto the lovely Houghton Mill which is well worth a visit. Heading north along the waymarked trail takes you along the river to Earith. There's also another public footpath running along the Ouse into nearby Hemingford Grey. Cyclists can continue along the Cambridge to St Ives busway cycle path. It's a great traffic free route running along a disused railway line.",
