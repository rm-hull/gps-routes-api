The trams were rebuilt in 1928 during the conversion to electric power and again in 1955 and 1990. The tramway closed in 1966 after a small accident but was saved from closure in 1969. The tramway again closed in 1982 and it was extensively repaired.The Tramway is now run by volunteer Trustees and volunteers from the local public. SGT is owned by Bradford Council and the Tustees have taken a 125 year lease on a full repair and maintenance basis, (Thanks to Glentramway for information)"

  "description": "Enjoy a short walk through this delightful glen near Bradford. Shipley Glen lies just to the north of the Yorkshire town of Shipley. It's a short walk from the train station or you could park on Glen Road. The glen has nice footpaths running through sheltered woods along a pretty beck. It's particularly lovely in the spring when you'll see lots of bluebells and Peacock Butterflies. There's also paths above the glen with splendid rock formations and great views to enjoy. You'll also pass the wonderful Bracken Hall near the start of the walk. Here you will find an informative museum, working farms, grassland, moor, woods, rocks, wildlife, history and archaeology. The centre has a wealth of information on the area and also organises guided walks. From the glen you can follow footpaths up to the adjacent Baildon Moor and enjoy wonderful views over Bradford and Leeds from Baildon Hill. You can also visit the fascinating Victorian village of Saltaire and pick up the River Aire Walk and Leeds and Liverpool Canal to extend your walking in the area. The Dales Way Link and the Bradford Millennium Way also pass the glen so you could pick these trails up and head north to visit Bingley Moor and Ilkley Moor. Just across the water is the town of Bingley where you can visit the country park of Bingley St Ives. There's miles of walking trails to be found here around the 500 acre estate. A few miles to the south you will find another splendid beauty spot Chellow Dene Reservoir .",
