  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Nosterfield Nature Reserve near West Tanfield . The route then goes onto visit the nearby Thornborough Henge and Nosterfield Quarry. All three sites are located close together and well worth a visit. The walk starts at the car park at Nosterfield Nature Reserve. Here you will find some pleasant footpaths taking you around a series of lakes. At the site there are also a number of bird hides where you can look out for a variety of water loving birds. After exploring the reserve, head east and then south to visit Thornborough Henge. The fasainating site inlcludes several ancient structures including a cursus, henges, burial grounds and settlements. The Neolithic and Bronze Age 'ritual landscape' is similar to Salisbury Plain and dates from between 3500 and 2500 BC. You can then continue east to visit Thornborough village before turning north to Nosterfield Quarry and Lingham Water. The site is another nature reserve with features including open water, reedbed, fen, exposed magnesian limestone, scrub,  and woodland.",
