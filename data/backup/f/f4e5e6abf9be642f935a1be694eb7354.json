  "description": "Visit the most westerly point of the Jurassic Coast on this circular walk from Exmouth. There's some moderate climbs with great coastal views to enjoy in both directions. The walk starts on the front in Exmouth and follows the coast path south east towards Maer Rocks and Maer Local Nature Reserve. The seaside reserve is a haven for wildlife and also includes many interesting coastal plants. You proceed to Orcombe Point where you will find splendid views and The Geoneedle sculpture. This was unveiled by Charles, Prince of Wales, in 2002 to mark the western end of the Jurrassic Coast World Heritage Site. It is made from a sample of each of the different rock types which can be found along the Jurassic coast. The route then passes along the lovely Sandy Bay with great views of the photogenic red sandstone cliffs of Rodney Point. You then head around the Devon Cliffs holiday park before following a country lane back into Exmouth. To extend the walk you can continue east along the Jurassic Coast to Budleigh Salterton where you can visit the delightful Otterton Mill. You can also try the Exmouth to Budleigh Salterton Railway Path which is suitable for cyclists and walkers. The Topsham to Exmouth Walk explores the beautiful Exe Estuary which is a great place for bird watching.",
