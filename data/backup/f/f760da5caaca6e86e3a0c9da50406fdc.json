      "caption": "Cliffs east of St Govan's Chapel. Storm waves breaking against 30m high limestone cliffs. Wave heights of up to 6.6m were measured at the nearby NDBC.\nThe coastal plateau is a late Cretaceous / early Tertiary marine erosion surface, exposed through tectonic uplift and eustatic (climate-influenced)lowering of sea level. The limestone beds dip south at approximately 15 degrees and are of variable thickness. The Carboniferous Limestone sequence in the Bosherston area is the thickest in Wales, in total around 1500m of strata (more than the height of Ben Nevis, if you could see it all in one place).\nThe beds are cut by sub-vertical fractures (joints).\nThe outer edge of the headland above the larger wave will probably fall away fairly soon, along a wide fissure that is clearly visible from several hundred metres way. This fissure has been opening along a master joint that extends through the limestone beds, and toppling failure is likely to occur."

The photo shows a particularly good example of a blowhole (gloup) at the top of a 35m high headland on the west side of Huntsman's Leap, near St Govan's Chapel.\nIf high tide coincides with large waves the blow hole shoots a column of seawater and spray up to 20m above the limestone plateau - people standing to right of blowhole provide scale.\nThe noise of the blast of seawater can sometimes be heard in Bosherston Village, 2km away from the blowhole, and the experience is similar to viewing a geyser.\nPlease note that this is a potentially hazardous location (particularly in stormy weather when sudden gusts of wind could blow you over). Nearby cliff edges are undercut, and the sides of the blowhole or the roof of any unseen cave shaft could collapse.\nThe feature lies within Range East (part of the MOD's Castlemartin Ranges) and this section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path is closed when firing is in progress."

  "description": "This fascinating 13th century chapel is situated by the side of a spectacular limestone cliff on the Pembrokeshire Coast. This circular walk takes you from the delightful village of Bosherton to the coastal chapel, passing through the beautiful Stackpole Estate on the way. The walk starts in Bosherton with its fine pub, pretty cottages and 13th century Norman church. You then follow a nice country lane through the countryside to the coast where you can climb down the 52 stone steps to the little chapel. There's a doorway into the chapel on the north side, where you will find low stone benches and an empty bell-cote\u00a0in a single chamber. The view out of the window towards the sea is wonderful. After leaving the chapel and climbing back up the steps you continue to St Govan's Head for more great coastal views. Look out for a variety of seabirds, including guillemots, razorbills and kittiwakes. The next section takes you from St Govan's Head to the sand dunes at Broad Haven. You then pass along the lovely Stackpole Lily Ponds where you can look out for\u00a0waterlilies in the summer and wildlife which includes the resident otters. The final waterside section along the ponds leads you back into Bosherton.",
