  "description": "The Portland Basin is situated next to several canals and a river making it a great place to start a walk. This route takes you along the Peak Forest Canal and the Tame Valley Way to the south of the basin. The walk starts from the Portland Basin museum on Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. From here you can pick up a waymarked trail heading south along the canal past Dukinfield and Hyde. Here you cross the canal to Haughton Green and turn north along the Tame Valley Way. The riverside path heads through Kingston before linking with the canal again. A short stretch along the towpath then takes you back to the museum. There's lots of other good options for continuing your walking around Portland Basin. For example you could pick up the Ashton Canal and head west to visit Audenshaw Reservoir. The Huddersfield Narrow Canal branches out to the east and can be followed toward Stalybridge where there's more views of the River Tame and the lovely Stalybridge Country Park .",
