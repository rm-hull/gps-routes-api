  "description": "This delightful village sits in a lovely spot on the Pembrokeshire Coast. There's a picturesque harbour and a beautiful beach to enjoy here. This circular walk from the village explores the coast path before heading into the surrounding countryside. The route uses sections of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and the Miners Walk, two long distance footpaths running through the area. On the walk you'll visit Wiseman's Bridge, Pleasant Valley, Stepaside, Kingsmoor and Bonvilles Court. Just north of the village look out for the old Stepaside Iron works, which is now a historic ruin. An information panel can be found here, detailing the history of the area. The old dramway here has recently been resurfaced and makes an ideal safe cycle for families all the way into Saundersfoot. The walk can be extended by heading north east to visit neighbouring Amroth with more details on the Amroth to Saundersfoot Walk. Here you can pay a visit to the lovely Amroth and Colby Woodland Garden where there's acres of interesting plants and flowers to see.",
