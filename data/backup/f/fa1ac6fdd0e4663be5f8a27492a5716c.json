  "description": "The coastal Suffolk town of Aldeburgh is a lovely place for walkers. This circular route takes you along the River Alde, through Aldeburgh Marshes and along Aldeburgh Bay. On the way there's a great deal of attractive, varied scenery to enjoy. The town has strong associations with Benjamin Britten, the leading British composer of the 20th century. On the coastal section of the walk you will pass the Scallop sculpture dedicated to him. The piece is made up of two interlocking scallop shells, with the following inscription: 'I hear those voices that will not be drowned', which are taken from Britten's opera Peter Grimes. Listening to this piece of music as you stroll along the beach would be the perfect accompaniment to the walk. The trail starts from the Fort Green car park on the sea front. Head south along the coast towards Slaughden before turning west to pick up the footpath along the River Alde. Just after West Row Point the path leaves the river to cross Aldeburgh Marshes. The marshes are great place for wildlife watching. Look out for King\ufb01shers, Snipe and Reed buntings as you make your way through this peaceful area. The route continues north through the North Warren RSPB reserve. The reserve is made up of grassland, lowland heath, reed bed, shingle, dune and woodland. It contains a variety of rare shingle flora and birds such as Eurasian bittern, European nightjar, nightingale and western marsh harrier. When you reach the Suffolk Coast path turn right and then head along the shingle beach back to the car park. This final section passes a model yacht pond, the lifeboat station and a pair of 19th-century look-out towers.",

The pub is dog friendly and will often provide treats for your pet. You can find the pub at postcode IP15 5AJ for your sat navs."
