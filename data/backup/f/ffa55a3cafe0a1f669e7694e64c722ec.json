  "description": "This lovely nature park near Stoke-on-Trent has four waymarked walking trails to try. All the walks start from the visitor centre which has displays, exhibitions and a shop. In the park you will find two large ponds, streams, easy woodland trails and a more challenging climb to Kingsley Banks where there are wonderful views over the Churnet Valley. The area is also great for wildlife with birds including Redstart, Pied Flycatcher, Woodcock and Tree Pipit. Also look out for grass snakes, butterflies and dragonflies around the peaceful pools. There are also lots of pretty plants and flowers to enjoy such as marsh-marigold, Butterbur and bluebells in the woods. At the eastern edge of the park you will find the pretty Caldon Canal. You could extend your walk by following the towpath to Consall Forge where you can stop for refreshments at the canalside Black Lion Inn. Also of interest is the Churnet Valley Steam Railway which runs alongside the canal. The beautiful Consall Hall Gardens lie just to the north and are well worth a visit in the summer months.",

This will take you to the lovely woodland at the Hawskmoor Nature Reserve and the nearby Dimmingsdale with its picturesque ponds. Just to the east of Stoke there's some nice cycling and walking trails around Park Hall Country Park. The former quarry site is now notable as Stoke on Trent's only National Nature Reserve comprising woodland, heathland and ponds. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
