  "description": "This historic market town lies just to the east of the city of Edinburgh in East Lothian. It's a lovely place to come for a walk with coastal paths along the Firth of Forth and riverside trails along the Esk to enjoy. This walk takes you along the beach before picking up a riverside path along the River Esk. The walk starts at the harbour and the pier and follows a shared cycling and walking path east along Fisherrow Beach. You'll come to the point where the river meets with the sea at the eastern end of the sands. Here you turn south and follow the river through the town to Eskview where you pick up the Penicuik to Musselburgh footway and cycleway. You can follow this south past Inveresk to Whitecraig and enjoy refreshment here before returning on the same paths. This final section passes the lovely Inveresk Gardens which is run by the National Trust for Scotland. To extend the walk continue west to Portobello where you can try the Edinburgh Coastal Beach Walk. There's a popular 2 mile stretch of sandy beach with some fine Georgian architecture, Ice cream parlours, arcades, beach-side cafes and bars.",
