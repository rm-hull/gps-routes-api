  "description": "This interesting Essex based village includes an historic castle, a church dating from the 12th-13th century, and a pleasant local nature reserve for easy walks. There's also an 18th century windmill and a toy museum which claims to be the largest in the world. This walk from the town visits Mountfitchet Castle before heading to the Aubrey Buxton Nature Reserve and Alsa Wood. The walk starts from the historic castle which dates back to the Norman period. Today it is run as Living History musuem where you can experience life as it was in 1066. From here you can pick up public footpaths heading north east through the fields to the Aubrey Buxton Nature Reserve. Here you will find woodlands, ponds and species rich grasslands. The site is run by Essex Wildlife Trust and is great for interesting flora and fauna. Look out for Common Spotted Orchids, nutatch and all three species of woodpecker. There's also lots of dragonflies to see around the pretty ponds. From here you can proceed north east and visit Alsa Wood before returning to the town centre on alternative paths. To continue your walking in the area head south to experience the peaceful woodland trails and wildlife in Birchanger Wood .",
