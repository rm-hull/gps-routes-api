  "description": "This country park has a number of peaceful woodland walks to enjoy. It is located near Gravesend in Kent. In the park you will find a pond/wetland area with a viewing platform, information point, and views out over the countryside. The woods are particularly lovely in the autumn where there are lots of mushrooms and fungi to look out for. The route below begins at the car park in Beacon Wood and follows woodland trails around the site. You can extend your walk by following public footpaths into the nearby Lords Wood, Ladies Wood and on into the nearby Darenth Country Park. It's located about a mile to the west and consists of nice wide lawns, picnic areas, meadows and pockets of woodland. In Darenth you can also pick up the Darent Valley Path and enjoy a riverside walk along the River Darent.",
