  "description": "This lake in Mansfield has a nice walking trail to follow around the perimeter of the water. The trail runs for just over a mile with nice views across the lake and lots of waterfowl to see too. Keep your eyes peeled for birds such as coot, grey heron and little grebe as you make your way around the water. You can park at the visitor centre at the southern side of the lake. From here you can pick up the flat waterside trail. The visitor centre is home to the The Mill Adventure Base where you can try various land and water activities such as mountain biking, climbing and kayaking. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the on-site cafe which has a good range of hot and cold food. The River Maun enters the reservoir at the north eastern end. You can pick up some nice riverside trails here to extend your walk. These lead east along the Timberland Trail to the Quarry Lane Nature Reserve and then into the pretty Titchfield Park. Just over 2 miles to the south east you can pick up the Robin Hood Way in Harlow Wood. You can follow the trail to the splendid Newstead Abbey, Papplewick village, Burntstump Country Park and Blidworth Woods where there are miles of nice woodland walking trails.",
