This view is a typical example taken from near the top of the scramble from Dovestone Reservoir to the edge of the moor."

  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Alphin Pike on Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester. From the 469 metre summit there are some splendid views over the Peak District hills. The varied route additionally visits Wimbury Rocks, Indian Head and Chew Reservoir. You can start the walk from the car park at the southern end of Dovestone Reservoir. From here you head west along Bradbury's Lane before turning east to climb to Alphin Pike. There's some fabulous views over the surrounding moorland and hills from here. There's also a great view back down to Dovestone Reservoir from the peak. You continue south east to Wimbury Rocks where you will find some impressive looking rock formations including Indian Head. It is so named as the shape is thought to resemble the profile of a North American Indian. The route continues east towards Chew Reservoir where there are some nice waterside trails to try. The final section heads west through the valley of the Chew Brook, passing the Chew Hills before returning to Dovestone Reservoir.",
