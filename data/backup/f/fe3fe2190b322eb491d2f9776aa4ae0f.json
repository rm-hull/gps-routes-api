  "description": "This walk visits the Moore Nature Reserve in the village of Moore in Halton, Cheshire. The 200 acre site includes good footpaths taking you around a series of pretty lakes, peaceful woodland and attractive meadows. It's great for wildlife with the reserve considered one of the premier birdwatching sites in the region. Look out for wildfowl including tufted duck and heron on the water. You may also see tawny owls and woodpeckers in the woodland areas. There's also paths along the now Disused Runcorn to Latchford Canal and views of the Manchester Ship Canal which runs to the south of the reserve. On the eastern side of the reserve you can extend the walk by picking up the Trans Pennine Trail and enjoying a stroll along the River Mersey and the Ship Canal through Warrington. If you follow the trail north east it will take you towards Sankey Valley Park where there are more good walking and cycling trails to try.",
