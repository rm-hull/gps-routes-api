  "description": "The village of Darfield is located near Barnsley in South Yorkshire. It's well positioned for exploring the lovely scenery of the River Dearne Valley. The RSPB's wildlife rich Old Moor Nature Reserve is also nearby. This walk from the village takes you along a section of the waymarked Dearne Way to visit the reserve. There's some nice footpaths to follow around the wetlands with widlife such as bitterns, lapwings, redshanks, avocets and wintering golden plovers to see. The circular walk then continues along the river to visit the neighbouring settlement of Bolton Upon Dearne. Part of the route also uses a section of the Trans Pennine Trail a popular long distance cycling and walking trail running through the area. The route also passes close to Manvers Lake which has a nice waterside footpath and a lakeside cafe. You can find the pretty lake just south of the river and the nature reserve.",
