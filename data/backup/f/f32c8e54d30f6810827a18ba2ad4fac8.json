At the finish, the time is calculated by computer and the runner gets a printout of all the times between controls on the course. Orienteering is cross country running, where shortcuts are allowed. The course is defined by a series of flags. You have to visit the flags in order,as fast as possible, the trick being to also work out from a map the quickest route."

  "description": "This large country park near Edinburgh has a number of excellent walking and cycling paths. The waymarked walking trails run through the ancient oak woodland and along the River Esk which runs through the park. Cyclists can follow the miles of estate roads and then follow a lovely off road path along the River Esk to Musselburgh on the coast. Look out for an abundance of wildlife including deer, foxes, herons and otters. To extend your walking in the area you could head into Holyrood Park in the city and climb to Arthur's Seat. This splendid hike is a real highlight of the area, commanding fine views over city and the coast. Also nearby is Bonaly Country Park where there are more good cycling and walking trails to try.",

      "content": "The Penicuik to Dalkeith Railway Walk can be picked up near the park. It takes you through some of Midlothian\u2019s historic villages on an easy path. Just to the east of the park you can explore the historic Carberry Hill and pick up the Pencaitland Railway Walk. The trail runs along a dismantled railway and is suitable for both walkers and cyclists. Similarly the Haddington to Longniddry Railway Walk runs between the two East Lothian towns for a distance of about 5 miles. Near here you'll also find the Gosford Estate where there's some nice trails to follow around the grounds of grand mansion. Just to the south of Arthur's Seat there's the pretty Duddingston Loch to explore. There's some nice waterside paths and the splendid Dr Neil's Garden to enjoy here. There's also some history in Duddingston village with a 12th century church and a 14th century pub, thought to be oldest in Scotland. Also in the Dalkeith area is Vogrie Country Park where you'll find some attractive parkland and gardens surrounding the baronial-styled Vogrie House. For more walks in the area see the Edinburgh Walks page."
