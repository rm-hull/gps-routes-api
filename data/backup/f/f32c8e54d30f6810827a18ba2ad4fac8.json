The memory chip carried by the runner then has the time of visit recorded. At the finish, the time is calculated by computer and the runner gets a printout of all the times between controls on the course. Orienteering is cross country running, where shortcuts are allowed. The course is defined by a series of flags. You have to visit the flags in order,as fast as possible, the trick being to also work out from a map the quickest route."

  "description": "This large country park near Edinburgh has a number of excellent walking and cycling paths. The waymarked walking trails run through the ancient oak woodland and along the River Esk which runs through the park. Cyclists can follow the miles of estate roads and then follow a lovely off road path along the River Esk to Musselburgh on the coast. Look out for an abundance of wildlife including deer, foxes, herons and otters. To extend your walking in the area you could head into Holyrood Park in the city and  climb to Arthur's Seat. This splendid hike is a real highlight of the area, commanding fine views over city and the coast. Also nearby is Bonaly Country Park where there are more good cycling and walking trails to try.",
