  "description": "This beautiful lake in Aberdeenshire has some good walking trails running along the water and through the surrounding woodland. The lake is located on the Pitfour Estate in Mintlaw. You could walk from the village or park in the parking area just off the A590. From here you can esily pick up the trails through the woodland to the lakeside. It's a peaceful spot with lovely views over the lake to the surrounding countryside. It's easy to extend your walk by heading south and visiting Aden Country Park. Here you'll find 230 acres of parkland with peaceful woodland, a lake and a Victorian arboretum. The long distance Formartine and Buchan Way runs just to the south of the lake. Pick this up and head west and you can visit Deer Abbey. It's less than a mile away and contains the fascinating ruins of a Cistercian monastery founded in 1219.",
