  "description": "Enjoy breathtaking views over the Snowdonia National Park on this challenging circular walk to the 947 m (3,107 ft) summit of Y Garn. The walk starts at the car park at the western end of Llyn Ogwen and climbs to the wonderful natural amphitheatre of Cwm Idwal. In a Radio Times poll in 2005, Cwm Idwal was ranked the 7th greatest natural wonder in Britain. You pass along the beautiful clear waters of Llyn Idwal before climbing towards Pinnacle Crag. You continue to the summit with views Llyn Clyd and the Ogwen Valley. The route then descends towards the Devil's Kitchen and Cwm Idwal before returning to the car park. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could try the challenging Tryfan mountain. If you continue north from the peak you can visit Foel-Goch, the Marchlyn Mawr reservoir and the summit of Elidir Fawr .",

It's open seven days per week for most of the year \u2013 opening only at weekends during the winter months. The popular snack bar can trace its history back to the early 1900\u2019s when it was precariously perched on rocks at the head of the waterfall from which it takes its name. Known throughout the world it has its place in the mountaineering history in this part of Snowdonia and has been run by the same family since 1953. It moved to its current location over forty years ago to the newer premises incorporating Snowdonia National Park warden office and public toilets. It sells a range of drinks, snacks, pasties, paninis and locally baked cakes. There's an outdoor seating area where you can enjoy your food with fine views of the surrounding mountains. You can find the snack bar between Llyn Ogwen and Llyn Idwal at postcode of LL57 3LZ for your sat navs."

The Lon Las Ogwen cycle route starts/finishes at the western side of Llyn Ogwen. The off road trail will take you north to the coast at Bangor, passing the splendid Penrhyn Quarry at Bethesda and the stunning glacial valley of Nant Ffrancon on the way. It runs mostly along old railway paths and the River Ogwen before finishing on the coast. The route is also suitable for walkers. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
