  "description": "Enjoy breathtaking views over the Snowdonia National Park on this challenging circular walk to the 947\u00a0m (3,107\u00a0ft)  summit of Y Garn. The walk starts at the car park at the western end of Llyn Ogwen and climbs to the wonderful natural amphitheatre of Cwm Idwal .  In a\u00a0Radio Times poll in 2005, Cwm Idwal was ranked the 7th greatest natural wonder in Britain.  You pass along the beautiful clear waters of Llyn Idwal before climbing towards Pinnacle Crag. You continue to the summit with views Llyn Clyd and the Ogwen Valley. The route then descends towards the Devil's Kitchen and Cwm Idwal before returning to the car park. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could try the challenging Tryfan mountain. If you continue north from the peak you can visit Foel-Goch, the Marchlyn Mawr reservoir and the summit of Elidir Fawr .",
