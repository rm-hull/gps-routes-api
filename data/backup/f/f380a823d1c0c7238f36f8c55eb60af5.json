  "description": "This circular walk takes you from the popular town of Ashbourne to the beautiful Dovedale in the Peak District. You'll also visit the wonderful viewpoint at Thorpe Cloud . The route runs for just over 8 miles with a moderate climb on the way. The walk starts just to the north of the town where you can pick up the Tissington Trail . Follow the waymarked path north before branching off to the north west towards Mapleton. Here you can follow another footpath heading north along the River Dove towards Thorpe and then on into Dovedale. The route takes you up to the iconic stepping stones where you'll likely see plenty of other walkers on a fine day. The stones were first set down in the 19th century for Victorian tourists to cross the river. The route then turns around to climb Thorpe Cloud, the small hill which overlooks the river here. After taking in the views from the hill summit you then descend to Lin Dale, picking up a path to take you back into Thorpe village. Here you can pick up the Tissington Trail again and follow the waymarked path back to Ashbourne.",
