  "description": "This walk visits the 19th century Studley Castle in Warwickshire. The Grade II listed country house is now a hotel but you don't have to be staying there to visit the site. You can enjoy an afternoon tea and then explore the lovely grounds or follow the Arden Way public footpath along the northern side of the house. This circular walk starts from Studley village, taking you over the River Arrow before linking up with the Arden Way. This will take you past the castle grounds and through the countryside towards Morton Baget where you can pick up the Warwickshire Millennium Way. This will take you south west across Morton Common towards Spernall where you meet with the River Arrow. From here you can follow a riverside path north to return to Studley. To extend the walk you could head south along the Arden Way to visit the nearby Coughton Court. The Tudor house includes some lovely gardens and walks along the River Arden. It also has a significant place in English history for its role in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 as some of the conspirators rode directly back there after it failed.",
