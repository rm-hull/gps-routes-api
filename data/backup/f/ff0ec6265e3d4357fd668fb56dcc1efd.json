  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Lough Eske in County Donegal. The route starts of at the impressive Lough Eske Castle on the western side of the lake. The 5 star hotel is a nice place to relax and enjoy an afternoon tea after the walk. Head east from the castle and you can pick up a section of the Bluestack Way, a long distance walking trail running through the area. The trail runs along the western side of the lake and through the adjacent woodland. You'll pass Harvey's Point where there are tremendous views across the water to the surrounding hills.",
