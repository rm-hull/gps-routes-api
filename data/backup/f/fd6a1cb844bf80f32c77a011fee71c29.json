  "description": "Follow the Rivers Orwell and the Stour on this walk through the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The walk begins on the Suffolk Coast at Felixstowe and soon turns north along the River Orwell for a waterside stretch towards Ipswich, passing the riverside Orwell Country Park, the lovely beach at Nacton Shores and Trimley Marshes Nature Reserve on the way. You then turn south along the western side of the Orwell towards Shotley Gate where you join the River Stour for the final stretch to Cattawade. This section passes the delightful Pin Mill where you can see lots of little boats in the river and enjoy refreshments at the 17th century Butt and Oyster pub. The trail is fairly flat for most of the way and runs for just over 40 miles.",
