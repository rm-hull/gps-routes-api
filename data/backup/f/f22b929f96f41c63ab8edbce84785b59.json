  "description": "Starting at Ogmore Castle on the River Ogwr, follow this relativley flat route around the town of Bridgend, South Wales. To the south of the town you pass through the picturesque villages of Ogmore by Sea and Merthyr Mawr. Here you'll pass close to the lovely Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes which are worth a short detour from the route. The National Nature Reserve is one of the area's highlights and includes the 'Big Dipper', the highest dune in Wales. There's also the option of picking up the Wales Coast Path here and following it towards Porthcawl on our Porthcawl Coastal Walk . To the north of the town you can visit Bryngarw Country Park . There's great walking trails here taking you to woodland, gardens, and an ornamental lake. Here you can also pick up the Garw Valley Railway Path . The shared cycling and walking path starts in the park and heads north along a disused railway line to Blaengarw alond the River Garw.",
