  "description": "This popular circular walk from Castleton climbs to the famous Mam Tor in the Peak District. The route runs for a distance of about 5 miles with some challenging climbs on the way. The route starts in Castleton, heading west from the village past Peak Cavern and Speedwell Cavern before coming to Winnats Pass . This area has some stunning limestone scenery and a number of interesting caves. The walk then bends round to the north to climb to Mam Tor which stands at a height of 517 m (1,696 ft). From the summit there are wonderful views over the Hope Valley and the surrounding hills, including Kinder Scout. After taking in the views you descend to Hollins Cross. This location is the lowest point on the Mam Tor ridge and is therefore a popular route taken by walkers wishing either to cross from one side to the other. From here you descend past Woodseats to Dunscar Farm before coming back into Castleton. You could also descend south west past Mam Farm to Little Mam Tor. This path runs past the Treak Cliff Cavern and Goosehill before coming into the village. For a longer route that continues along the ridge to Lose Hill please see the Castleton Circular Walk page.",
