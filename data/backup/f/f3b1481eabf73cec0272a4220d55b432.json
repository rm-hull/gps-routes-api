  "description": "Enjoy a walk across this atmospheric moor in the Peak District. You can start at the car park at Dovestone Reservoir and follow footpaths past Yeoman Hey Reservoir and Greenfield Reservoir. You then follow the Greenfield Brook to Raven Stones Brow with little waterfalls to enjoy on the way. After crossing the brook you then head up and across the moor. This is a challenging section with the moor reaching heights of around 1500ft. There are excellent views over the reservoirs to the surrounding Pennine Hills and some fascinating geological features to look out for on the way. From the high point on the moor you descend to Dovestone Reservoir and enjoy a woodland and waterside section taking you back to the car park. To extend your walk you can pick up the Oldham Way and follow it south over the Chew Hills to Chew Reservoir. You could also reach the moor from nearby Mossley train station by following the Oldham Way.",
