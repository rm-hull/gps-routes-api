  "description": "This delightful North York Moors village has some lovely local woodland and riverside walks to try. This circular walk from the village visits the ruins of the 14th century Ayton Castle before heading through the Forge Valley Woods . The walk starts in the village and heads north and then east to Dreakenfield Hill, passing the photogenic castle remains on the way. You then head north through Stonyflat Wood before passing through the splendid Forge Valley. There's a lovely boardwalk to follow through the gorge with views of the River Derwent to enjoy. Also look out for a variety of wildlife including woodland birds and deer. You continue north to Cockrah Foot where you could take a detour north to visit Hackness or west to Wykeham Forest . This route heads south returning to the village on alternative footpaths through through Scarwell Wood and the Forge Valley.",
