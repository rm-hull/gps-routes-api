  "description": "This waymarked walk visits the Carmarthenshire town of Laugharne, former home of poet Dylan Thomas. The walk was created by Bob Stevens to \"help promote Dylan Thomas's poetry and for more people to while away their own birthdays\". The walk pays tribute to Dylan's \"Poem in October\" which describes his birthday walk to the shoulder of St John's Hill. You can see the poem in full below. You can start your walk from the Dylan Thomas boathouse. The house is very photogenic, being set in a cliff overlooking the estuary. It was at this house that he wrote many major pieces including part of 'Under Milk Wood'. The house now serves as a museum which is open to the public for most of the year. You then follow the coast path past the historic Laugharne Castle and along Railsgate Pill before finishing at St John's Hill. Along the way there's lovely coastal scenery, views of the River Coran and lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. There's also handy information boards with more details about Thomas and the area.",
