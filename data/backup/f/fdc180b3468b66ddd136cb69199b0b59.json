  "description": "This circular walk from Binfield Heath visits Crowsley Park, owned by the BBC in South Oxfordshire. Since the Second World War, the park has been the site of a signals-receiving station used by BBC Monitoring. In 2018, the BBC began a further modernisation of the facility, including the installation of 18 new satellite dishes. The walk starts from the small village of Binfield Heath and follows the Chiltern Way north to explore Crowsley Park Woods. You continue to Gillsmithers Woods before turning south west to skirt the edge of Crowsley Park. You can enjoy views towards the 165 acre estate which includes an 18th century mansion house and three very large satellite dishes. After leaving the woods you can follow a country lane south east to return to Binfield Heath.",
