  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around the 1800 acre park surrounding the Edwardian Stansted House near Chichester. The parkland has a series of public footpaths to follow around the estate with woodland, moderate hill climbs and countryside views. The walk starts from the car park at the western end of the park. You could also start from Rowland's Castle which has a train station close by. From the car park you can pick up the Monarch's Way and follow it east through the edge of Stansted Forest to Walderton. Here the route turns south following footpaths to Lordington House. The Grage II listed building was built in 1500 and now operates as a bed and breakfast. The path then turns west to the noteworthy Racton Monument. The 80 ft (24m) high folly dates from the 18th century and affords wonderful views to the Isle of Wight. The route then follows Park Lane west before turning north to pass Stansted House. The house began as a hunting lodge in the 11th century. It was built on the present site in 1688 but burnt down in 1900, and rebuilt on the exact footprint of the previous building in 1903. After passing the house the route soon returns to the finish point back at the car park. You can extend the walk by continuing east along the Monarch's Way to Stoughton and the Kingley Vale National Nature Reserve. Here you can enjoy a large yew forest and fabulous views over the South Downs towards the south coast. Heading west will take you to Staunton Country Park and Havant Thicket where there are more good trails to try.",

      "content": "The Rowlands Castle Walk starts from the train station in the nearby village. It heads to Stansted Park and Havant Thicket and Staunton Country Park. The route is a nice way of seeing all of these local attractions in one loop. The village is also worth exploring with its picturesque village green and remains of the old castle to see. Head south from the park and you will soon come to the coast. Here you can try the Emsworth Walk and visit the picturesque harbour. For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks page."
