You can start your walk from the dam at the eastern end of the water and then follow footpaths west along the loch. It's a tranquil place with lovely views over the water to the surrounding hills and countryside. The walk can be extended by heading into the surrounding forestry and hills.",

You could also head south towards Dunfermline and visit Townhill Country Park, Gartmorn Dam Country Park, Dollar Glen, Alva Glen, Glendevon and Lochore Meadows Country Park. These local parks have a good selection of walking and cycling trails to try. The splendid Loch Leven and the remote Loch Fitty are also not too far away."
