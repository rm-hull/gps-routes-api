  "description": "Explore 360 acres of lakes, meadows and woodland, in this park situated on the river Great Ouse in Bedford. The park includes the pretty Priory Marina and lake which are perfect for a peaceful waterside walk or cycle. National Cycle Network route 51 passes through the park so you can continue your cycle on the Bedford to Sandy cycle route. For walkers the John Bunyan Trail passes through Bedford if you wish to continue your walk. On the opposite side of the park there's also the Fenlake Meadows nature reserve. The meadows are the largest and best preserved flood plain grazing meadows in Bedfordshire. There's a circular footpath around the site though it can sometimes be flooded.",
