  "description": "The Gwynedd village of Llanbedr is in a great location on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park and close to some beautiful coast, riverside trails and a scenic river estuary. This walk takes you along a section of the Wales Coast path to neighbouring Llandanwg. The walk starts at Llanbedr train station. From here head north west and you can pick up a section of the Wales coast path along the River Artro. This will take you past the Neolithic standing stones towards Sarn Hir where you cross the river. Continue north west and the path will take you past Pensarn with great views over the Artro Estuary to the Rhinog Mountains. The route then continues to the coast at Llandanwg. Here you can explore the Twyni Llandanwg Sand Dunes and the lovely beach. There's also the National Trust's Y Maes located behind the dunes.",

      "content": "Head east into Snowdonia and you can enjoy a more challenging walk to Rhinog Fawr. Also just to the east is something of a hidden gem at the wonderful Nantcol Waterfalls. The area includes pleasant trails along the River Cwmnantcol with a series of rushing waterfalls to see along the way. There's also a circular walk around a small reservoir, just west of the falls. The Harlech Walk runs past the village. This visits the nearby Morfa Dyffryn Nature Reserve. The beautiful reserve includes huge sand dunes, seashore, saltmarsh and grassland with a wide variety of wildlife to look out for. Just to the south there's the village of Dyffryn Ardudwy where there's a train station for public transport access. There's also the fascinating Dyffryn Ardudwy Burial chamber to explore in the village. The ancient site includes a hut circle and a number of dolmen dating back over 6000 thousand years.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
