  "description": "The Gwynedd village of Llanbedr is in a great location on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park and close to some beautiful coast, riverside trails and a scenic river estuary. This walk takes you along a section of the Wales Coast path to neighbouring Llandanwg. The walk starts at Llanbedr train station. From here head north west and you can pick up a section of the Wales coast path along the River Artro. This will take you past the Neolithic\u00a0standing stones towards Sarn Hir where you cross the river. Continue north west and the path will take you past Pensarn with great views over the Artro Estuary to the Rhinog Mountains. The route then continues to the coast at Llandanwg. Here you can explore the Twyni Llandanwg Sand Dunes and the lovely beach. There's also the National Trust's Y Maes located behind the dunes.",
