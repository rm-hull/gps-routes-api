  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Avon Valley Path from the Hampshire town of Fordingbridge to Ibsley. It's about a 4 mile walk on a good waymarked path, with some waterside sections and fine views of the surrounding countryside on the way. The walk starts on the old bridge in Fordingbridge which spans the River Avon. The impressive old bridge is 40 metres long and consists of seven stone arches. From here you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it south to St Mary's Church which dates from the 12th century. The route continues past Bickton and Harbridge Farm where you turn east to cross the river and finish in the village of Ibsley.",
