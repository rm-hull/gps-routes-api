  "description": "Climb to the highest point in Hampshire on this walk on the Berkshire/Hampshire border. The walk starts from the Inkpen Beacon car park about 2 miles north west of the hill. From here you pick up the Wayfarer's Walk and follow it past Walbury Hill and the pretty West Woodhay Down. At 297 m (974 ft) Walbury Hill is the highest point in Berkshire and South East England. At the summit you can enjoy more great views over the county and explore the Iron Age Hill fort of Walbury Camp. The route continues to Pilot Hill where you pick up the Brenda Parker Way to take you to the Hampshire village of Faccombe. Here you can enjoy refreshments before returning to the car park the same way. To extend your walk you can continue along the Brenda Parker Way to Faccombe Wood and St Mary Bourne. The village is well worth a visit with rows of picturesque thatched cottages and views of the pretty Bourne Rivulet, a tributary of the River Test.",
