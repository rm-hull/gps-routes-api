  "description": "This Kent based visit is located on the coast near Romney Marsh, Hythe and Folkestone. There's some good coastal trails with a nice beach and the old Redoubt Fort and Martello Towers to see. This walk from the village takes you south along the sea wall and the beaches to the Dungeness Nature Reserve. The walk starts at the Martello Tower on the seafront in Dymchurch. You can then follow the coastal path south to St Mary's Bay and Littlestone near New Romney. You continue south to the sand dunes at Romney Sands, Greatstone-on-Sea and Lydd-on-Sea before coming to Dungeness. The expansive reserve includes miles of footpaths taking you to shingle beach, lakes, the old lightouse and the nuclear power station.",
