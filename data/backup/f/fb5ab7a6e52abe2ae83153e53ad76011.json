  "description": "A circular walk around St Ives visiting Carbis Bay. It's about a 3.5 mile walk with lovely coastal and country views. Start the walk by the pier in St Ives and then follow the South West Coast Path south to Porthminster Point, passing Porthminster beach on the way. You then come to the beautiful Carbis Bay where there is a stunning golden beach. The route then heads west through the town before turning north to Trelyon. The final secion passes the Tregenna Castle resort and golf course before returning to St Ives.",
