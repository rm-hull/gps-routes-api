  "description": "A circular walk around St Ives visiting Carbis Bay. It's about a 3.5 mile walk with lovely coastal and country views. Start the walk by the pier in St Ives and then follow the South West Coast Path south to Porthminster Point, passing Porthminster beach on the way. You then come to the beautiful Carbis Bay where there is a stunning golden beach. The route then heads west through the town before turning north to Trelyon. The final secion passes the Tregenna Castle resort and golf course before returning to St Ives.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you can try the St Ives to Lelant Walk and the St Ives to Zennor Walk. Near Zennor there's also the beautiful rocky promontory at Gurnards Head and the Penwith Moors and Men-An-Tol Walk. This fascinating walk visits several ancient sites including Men-An-Tol standing stones and the Lanyon Quoit dolmen. You'll also pass the remains of the old Ding Dong Mines and climb to the fine viewpoint at Carn Galver. In the village you could pay a visit to the Tate Gallery which displays modern works by artists with links to the St Ives area. You can find them at Porthmeor Beach with postcode TR26 1TG. There's also the lovely Barbara Hepworth Museum which includes a delightful sculpture garden displaying her works. She purchased the site in 1949 and lived and worked there for 26 years. The studio and garden have been left in much the same state. You can find the museum at Barnoon Hill, Saint Ives TR26 1AD. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
