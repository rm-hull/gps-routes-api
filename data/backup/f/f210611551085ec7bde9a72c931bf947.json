  "description": "This circular walk visits Coldingham Bay, St Abbs Head and Coldingham Loch on the Berwickshire Coast. It's a beautiful area with white sands, cliff top views and seasonal wildflowers to enjoy. The walk starts from the Coldingham Bay car park which lies just to the east of Coldingham village. From here you can pick up the coastal path and follow it north to St Abbs Head, passing Starney Bay and Horsecastle Bay on the way. The headland has a great viewpoint where you can look out for a variety of seabirds. The route continues west to West in Thirle Bay and Tunlaw Bank where you leave the coast to visit the pretty Coldingham Loch. Follow trails around the loch to Westloch House where you pick up a country lane heading south east to Coldingham village. You'll pass the ruins of the ancient priory before the final section takes you back to the car park.",
