  "description": "This circular walk takes you to the lovely Clamp Hole Waterfall in Glenbarrow near Rosenallis in the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The scenic walk runs for about 4.2km along a fairly flat trail with expansive peaceful woodland for further exploration. You can start the walk from the Glenbarrow Car Park just north of the falls. From here you can pick up waterside trails along the River Barrow heading south to Clamp Hole Waterfall. It's a lovely secluded spot with the rushing falls surrounded by lush green vegetation. The route then returns through alternative woodland paths just to the east of the river. Part of the route uses a section of the Slieve Bloom Way. This long distance waymarked trail runs for 70km, taking you through some of the highlights of the Slieve Bloom Mountains. If you follow it west you could try the Kinnitty Castle Loop Walk which visits a striking 19th century Gothic Revival Castle and the Camcor River Valley.",
