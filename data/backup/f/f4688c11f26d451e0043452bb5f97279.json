  "description": "Enjoy woodland, meadows and the lovely Daventry Reservoir on this waterside route in Northamptonshire. The southern part of the reservoir is a designated nature reserve with bird hides. There is also a delightful nature trail through the sensory garden to the pond, with useful information boards along the way. The park has a Visitor Centre, fitness equipment and a cafe. It is located just north of Daventry town centre. The Grand Union Canal is only about 1/2 a mile from the park so you could continue the route along the towpath if you have time. Just to the south east you can pick up a nice footpath around Borough Hill . There's good views over the surrounding area from the high points.",
