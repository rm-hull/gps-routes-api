  "description": "Enjoy woodland, meadows and the lovely Daventry Reservoir on this waterside route in Northamptonshire. The southern part of the reservoir is a designated nature reserve with bird hides. There is also a delightful nature trail through the sensory garden to the pond, with useful information boards along the way. The park has a Visitor Centre, fitness equipment and a cafe. It is located just north of Daventry town centre. The Grand Union Canal is only about 1/2 a mile from the park so you could continue the route along the towpath if you have time. Just to the south east you can pick up a nice footpath around Borough Hill. There's good views over the surrounding area from the high points.",

      "content": "Just to the south of the town there's some pleasant woodland trails to be found at Badby Woods. Near here there's also the historic Fawsley Hall where you can see a fine 15th century house surrounded by lakes, formal gardens and parkland landscaped by Capability Brown. To the north you'll find Drayton Reservoir, a popular fishing venue on the Middlemore Estate. Head west along the canal and you could visit the worthy village of Napton on the Hill. Here you'll find a 12th century church and nice walks along Napton Reservoir and the Oxford Canal Walk. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northamptonshire Walks page."
