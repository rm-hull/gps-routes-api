  "description": "Enjoy a walk around this beautiful coastal national nature reserve near Skegness. It's a lovely place for a peaceful stroll with numerous footpaths to follow through the sand, saltmarsh and dunes with several artificial lakes and bird hides along the way. There are lovely views of the Wash and the Lincolnshire coast and countryside. It's fantastic for bird watching with a variety of coastal birds to look out for. These include brent geese, shorelark, redwing and fieldfare. There's also an excellent visitor centre with a Wild Coast Exhibition that includes 3d models of sand dunes and salt marshes. The reserve is located just a few miles south of Skegness so you could easily walk there from the town. Parking is available at the reserve too though.",
