  "description": "This walk takes you around this delightful reservoir, near Pateley Bridge and Ramsgill. The route makes use of the Nidderdale Way footpath which runs around the reservoir. It's a super place for birdwatching with three viewing areas  on the edge of the reservoir.\u00a0 Look out for\u00a0great spotted woodpecker\u00a0and\u00a0nuthatch in the trees around the water.\u00a0On the reservoir you can spot goosanders, goldeney,\u00a0mallard,\u00a0tufted duck\u00a0and\u00a0pochard.  Other visitors include buzzard,\u00a0red kite,\u00a0hen harriers,\u00a0merlins\u00a0and\u00a0kestrels. This walk starts at the car park on the western end of the reservoir but you could also start at Pately Bridge and follow the River Nidd to the reservoir. To extend your walk you could follow the Nidderdale Way to the spectacular limestone gorge at How Stean Gorge . The Six Dales Trail also passes the through the area.
