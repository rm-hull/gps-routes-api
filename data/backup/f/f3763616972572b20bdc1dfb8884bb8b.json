  "description": "This walk takes you around this delightful reservoir, near Pateley Bridge and Ramsgill. The route makes use of the Nidderdale Way footpath which runs around the reservoir. It's a super place for birdwatching with three viewing areas on the edge of the reservoir. Look out for great spotted woodpecker and nuthatch in the trees around the water. On the reservoir you can spot goosanders, goldeney, mallard, tufted duck and pochard. Other visitors include buzzard, red kite, hen harriers, merlins and kestrels. This walk starts at the car park on the western end of the reservoir but you could also start at Pately Bridge and follow the River Nidd to the reservoir. To extend your walk you could follow the Nidderdale Way to the spectacular limestone gorge at How Stean Gorge. The Six Dales Trail also passes the through the area. If you follow if north you can cross Fountains Earth Moor and visit the nearby Leighton Reservoir .",

They have a good bar menu and a nice cosy interior with a roaring log fire. In warmer months you can enjoy your drink and meal outside, surrounded by the sights and sounds of summer. The building also has an interesting history dating all the way back to the 1600s. You can find the inn at Wath with a postcode of HG3 5PP for your sat navs. At the other end of the water you'll find the Yorke Arms in Ramsgill. It's another historic building having once been an 18th century coaching house. The site was also a monastic cheesery as far back as the eleventh century before becoming a coaching inn when the Yorke family disposed of their lands and properties. They do excellent food and have a lovely garden area too. You can find the hotel by the Ramsgill Beck at a postcode of HG3 5RL."

      "content": "If you follow the Nidderdale Way south east then you will arrive at one of the highlights of the area at Brimham Rocks. The National Trust owned site includes an extraordinary collection of large rock formations which are hundreds of millions of years old. It's a geoligically fascinating area with good walking trails across the surrounding Brimham Moor to explore. Just to the east of the rocks there's the more secluded Eavestone Lake to explore as well. Just to the south east there's the worthy villages of Summerbridge and Dacre Banks. There's some nice river walks along the River Nidd and a fine 18th century pub to visit in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nidderdale Walks and the Yorkshire Dales Walks pages."
