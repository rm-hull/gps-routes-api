  "description": "This circular walk explores Macclesfield Forest and also pays a visit to the pretty Trentabank Reservoir on the western edge of the Peak District. The walk starts at the Standing Stone car park on the eastern edge of the forest. You then head west on good woodland footpaths through the conifer forest, passing along the Bollin Brook before arriving at Trentabank Reservoir. The area is great for wildlife spotting with a large heronry and other water loving birds such as common sandpiper, green sandpiper and little ringed plover. You may also see red deer in the woodland area. The area also include grassland with a variety of pretty plants and flowers including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed. From the reservoir the route heads south back into the woodland towards Nessit Hill before returning to the car park. It's easy to extend your walking in this lovely area. You could head west past Ridegate Reservoir and pick up the Gritstone Trail and follow it to the excellent Tegg's Nose Country Park. The forest is located a few miles south east of Macclesfield town.",
