  "description": "This walk visits the Knucklas Viaduct near the village of Knucklas in Powys, Wales. The impressive 13-arch span was completed by the Central Wales Railway in 1865. It is located on the Heart of Wales Line, a spectacular rural railway running between Swansea and Shrewsbury. The village is on the Heart of Wales Line Trail, a long distance walking trail visiting several of the train stations and settlements on the route. This circular walk uses part of the trail and the epic Glyndwr's Way to explore the hills to the south of the settelment. From here there are some excellent views to the viaduct and the surrounding countryside of the River Teme valley. To extend the walk you could follow the Heart of Wales Line Trail south east to visit the historic town of Knighton where you can enjoy riverside trails along the River Teme and climb to the viewpoint at Cwm-sanaham Hill.",
