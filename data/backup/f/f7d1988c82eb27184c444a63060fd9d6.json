      "caption": "Steps down to the Sailor's Stone.  In 1786, a sailor travelling from London to Portsmouth docks was brutally murdered by three individuals he had befriended in a local pub in Thursley. Following this tragic event, the Sailor\u2019s Stone was erected to mark the spot where the sailor lost his life. The three highwaymen responsible for the crime were subsequently tried and hanged on Gibbet Hill, close to the scene of the murder, as a deterrent to other potential criminals. Following the executions, various fears and superstitions emerged surrounding Gibbet Hill. In 1851, Sir William Erle, an English lawyer, judge, and Whig politician, funded the installation of a Celtic cross on Gibbet Hill to dispel these fears and uplift the local community. The Celtic cross has since been designated as a Grade II listed monument by English Heritage. To delve into the area's grim history, one can take a walk along the Old Portsmouth Road around the Devil\u2019s Punch Bowl, where both the Celtic cross and the Sailor\u2019s Stone with its inscription can be found."

The structure known as the Temple of the Four Winds was constructed circa 1910 by Viscount Pirrie, a prominent Irish shipbuilder and entrepreneur. Situated within the Viscount's Witley Park estate, this area once housed a deer park, where elaborate picnics were frequently hosted at the lodge for his hunting companions. Viscount Pirrie took pleasure in surveying his estate from this vantage point and appreciating the expansive vistas. Regrettably, over time, the lodge fell into disrepair and was subjected to vandalism in 1959. By 1966, it posed a hazard and had to be dismantled, leaving only the stone base intact. Nevertheless, with assistance from the Black Down & Hindhead Supporters, the vegetation surrounding the old lodge has been cleared, once again revealing splendid views. Take a hike up to Hurt Hill to witness the ongoing restoration efforts, aimed at eventually reinstating the stone plinth to its former grandeur."

Legend has it that Conan Doyle drew inspiration from Hindhead for his famous novel 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'."

  "description": "Hindhead is the highest village in Surrey and a great place to start a walk. There's miles of woodland and heathland trails across the National Trust's Hindhead Common. The area includes hill climbs, wildlife, ponds and the popular Devil's Punch Bowl. This circular walk from Hindhead explores Hindhead Common, Gibbet Hill and the southern part of the woods. You can start the walk from the National Trust car park on the common and follow footpaths east up to Gibbet Hill where there are excellent views to enjoy. On the way you'll pass the Sailor's memorial stone which has an interesting history attached to it. See the video below for more details. The route then descends into the Hurthill Copse before following bridleways south west. The route then turns north towards the Tyndalls Estate and the car park.",
