  "description": "This is a circular long distance, waymarked trail running through Wiltshire. It starts at the Westbury White Horse and runs through Pewsey, Marlborough, Broad Town, Cherhill, Devizes, Steeple Ashton and Bratton. The walk runs through some beautiful Wiltshire countryside and also visits fascinating historical sites such as the Avebury Stones and Silbury Hill. Other highlights include the Lansdowne Monument at the Cherhill White Horse near the watershed of the River Avon and the River Thames. Near here you'll also pass Hackpen Hill and it's associated white horse. Also known as the Broad Hinton White Horse it was created in 1838 to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria. There's also a long waterside section along the Kennet and Avon Canal through Devizes and wonderful views across the Vale of Pewsey around Pewsey."
