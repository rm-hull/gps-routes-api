  "description": "This walk visits the Taverham Mill Nature Reserve in the village of Taverham, Norfolk. The reserve is a lovely place for a walk with a series of pretty lakes and riverside paths along the River Wensum. There's three colour coded walking trails taking you to grassland, woodland, water meadow and a wild flower meadow. On the way you can look out for a variety of wildlife including otters on the river, Pipistrelle bats, wading birds and a herd of Highland cattle and Scottish Blackface sheep. Just to the south east there's more paths along the Costessey Pits and the option to pick up the Costessey Circular Walk. To continue your walking in the area head north to Broadland Country Park where you can enjoy a series of cycling and walking trails. The park sits right next to Horsford Woods where there's some nice peaceful woodland trails to enjoy as well.",
