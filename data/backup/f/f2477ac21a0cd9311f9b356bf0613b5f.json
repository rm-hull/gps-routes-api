  "description": "This lovely waterside walk in St Andrews takes you along the old mill lade. The popular footpath starts in the town centre and heads west along the Kinness Burn. You'll pass Woodburn Park, Kinness Burn Viaduct and Cockshaugh Park on your way along the 1.5 mile route. Towards the end of the walk you'll come to the historic Law Mill which is particularly picturesque. There's also the option of crossing the burn and visiting the lovely St Andrews Botanic Gardens on the other side. Here you'll find over 8000 species of native and exotic plants. These are laid out in zones of woodland, meadow, shrubbery, herbaceous bedding, a large rockery and a series of ponds. There are also vegetable and herb gardens, and several large greenhouses, one of which contains a butterfly house. To extend your walking in St Andrews you can pick up the St Andrews to Anstruther Coastal Walk . The route follows the beautiful Fife Coast Path with beaches, interesting geological rock formations and pretty coastal villages.  You could also head to Craigtoun Country Park which is located just a few miles south-west of St Andrews. The park has a number of attractions including a ruined temple, nature trail, Italian garden, greenhouses, formal gardens, a miniature railway and a large pond where you can hire rowing boats and pedal boats.",
