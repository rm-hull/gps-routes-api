  "description": "This walk visits the Rainton Meadows Nature Reserve near \nWest Rainton and Houghton le Spring, County Durham. The pretty reserve is run by Durham Wildlife Trust and includes their headquarters. You can follow a series of easy footpaths around the site with habitats including lakes, wetlands, grassland and woodland. It's great for wildlife with bird species including redshank, oystercatcher, lapwing and little ringed plover. There's also grazing Exmoor ponies in the winter months. To continue your walking in the area head just a couple of miles south west to visit Finchale Abbey . Here you can explore substantial ancient ruins of the English Heritage owned priory and enjoy riverside walks along the River Wear. The Great North Forest Heritage Trail runs right past the reserve. One nice idea is to pick up the trail and follow it to nearby Hutton-le-Hole where you can explore the lovely Hetton Lyons Country Park .",
