An information board by the footpath informs about this geological feature which was created during the Quaternary period by melt water from glaciers forming a tunnel beneath the ice, and carrying large quantities of sand, gravel and flint that the glaciers had scraped out. When the glaciers retreated these tubes of sediment were left behind leaving the features visible today. The southern end of the Esker (Wiveton Downs) represents one of the very best examples of an Esker formation to be seen anywhere, and this is the reason for its SSSI designation."

The village of Wiveton is situated on the west bank of the River Glaven, about one kilometre distant, across the river, from the village of Cley next the Sea. Wiveton has a population of about 160; some of the houses are second homes with the owners absent for most of the year. Until the 17th century, when the River Glaven was still navigable, Wiveton had a harbour, the outline of which can be seen in the fields separating it from Cley. There is a medieval bridge a short distance south of the church. The village made headlines in 1779, when the then newly-appointed Rector, James Hackman, was hanged for murdering Martha Ray, the mistress of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich (who is credited with inventing the sandwich)."
