  "description": "This walk visits the Cromwell Point Lighthouse on Valentia Island in the southwest of County Kerry. The island is one of Ireland's most westerly points and includes a wonderful, rugged coastline. There is a car parking area just south of the lighthouse where you can start your walk. From here head north along a track to the lighthouse where you can enjoy some stunning views over the coast to the surrounding mountains and islands. Valentia Lighthouse is home to the most westerly harbour light on mainland Ireland. The light guides vessels from the sea and leads them through the northern entrance of the harbour and up past Harbour Rock.",
