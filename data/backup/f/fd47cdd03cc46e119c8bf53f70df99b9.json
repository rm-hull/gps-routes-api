  "description": "This coastal walk takes you along the spectacular Causeway coast from Portballintrae to Ballintoy via Dunseverick. The route runs for about 12.8 miles following a fairly easy footpath past the spectacular rock formations of the Giant's Causeway. Start the walk from the picturesque harbour at Portballintrae and head east to Portnaboe and Bushmills. Here you'll find the National Trust's Giant's Causeway visitor centre where there's interactive exhibitions and visitor services, audio guides and guided walking tours. The Giant's Causeway is one of the major highlights in the country and includes some incredible geological features. You continue east past Bengore Head to Dunsverick Castle . The ancient ruins are perched in a photogenic location on the cliff tops and are thought to date back to the 5th century. The trail continues past the pretty village of Portbraddan before passing along the wide sandy beach at Whitepark Bay. The final section runs along the beach to Ballintoy where you'll find a lovely harbour and a good range of shops, cafes and restaurants. Near here you can also pick up the Carrick-a-Rede Walk and cross the famous rope bridge to visit Carrick-a-Rede Island.",
