  "description": "This walk explores the steep sided Kenidjack Valley, near St Just in west Cornwall. On the walk you will see remaining evidence of the valley's interesting tin mining history. There's also views of the Tregeseal River which flows through the valley into the sea. The walk starts from the National Trust car park at the Counting House, just to the north of the valley. From here follow footpaths south west past the Botallack Mines to the valley. You can then enjoy a circular walk through the area, visiting the old Wheal Owles, Wheal Castle, Boswedden Mine and the Kenidjack arsenic works. There's also a nice coastal stretch past the ancient Kenidjack Castle which dates from the Iron Age and sits in an exposed position on the edge of dramatic cliffs. This area is great for spotting sea birds with Peregrines and Choughs often found here. On a clear day there are also far reaching views over the sea to the Isles of Scilly.",
