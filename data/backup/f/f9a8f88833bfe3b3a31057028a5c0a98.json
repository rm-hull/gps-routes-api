  "description": "This circular walk visits the popular Harlestone Firs in Northamptonshire. The woods are located just a few miles north west of Northampton, near Dallington. There's 300 acres to explore on a network of footpaths and bridleways. You can start the walk from the parking area near the Harlestone Heath Garden Centre on Harlestone Road. From here you can pick up footpaths heading east into the woods. The circular trail will take you across Harlestone Heath and Dallington Heath before returning to the car park. On the way you'll pass mainly fir trees and an old sawmill. There's also lots of wildlife with squirrels and woodland birds to look out for on the way. The route is designed for walkers but the area is also good for cycling with several mountain bike trails to try.",
