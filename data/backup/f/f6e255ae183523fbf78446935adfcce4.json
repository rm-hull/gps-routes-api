      "caption": "Dornoch Sands. The name 'Dornoch' originates from the Gaelic term for 'pebbly place', indicating the presence of fist-sized pebbles (dorn) that could be used as weapons. Archaeological excavations conducted during the development of a new business park in 1997 unveiled a building, evidence of ironworking, and a portion of a whale dating back to the 8th to 11th centuries AD. Archaeologists inferred that these findings represent an industrial area on the outskirts of a settlement, suggesting the existence of a settlement in Dornoch since at least the 8th century. However, the earliest direct mention of a settlement in Dornoch dates back to the early 12th century when David I, noted in the Dunfermline Abbey register, instructs Rognvald, the Earl of Orkney, to show respect to the monks at Dornoch. Dornoch boasts the thirteenth-century Dornoch Cathedral, the Old Town Jail, and the former Bishop's Palace, which has been transformed into the renowned Dornoch Castle Hotel. Additionally, it is home to the esteemed Royal Dornoch Golf Club, recognised as the 5th best golf course outside the United States in 2005 by Golf Digest."

Stations along the line included Dornoch, Embo, Skelbo, Cambusavie Halt, and The Mound Junction. These stations ceased operations on 13 June 1960. Margaret C. Davidson, a Modern Languages teacher at Dornoch Academy, led the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in the burgh from 1913.

This was undertaken to raise funds for converting the unused primary school in the village into a community centre. The village introduced its own currency, known as the Cuddie, with an exchange rate of two Cuddies to the pound. Cuddies were accepted at the local public house, Grannies Heilan' Hame, in exchange for a measure of Clynelish Malt Whisky. The distillery owners in nearby Brora sponsored the bid for independence by issuing a commemorative label on 50 cases of Clynelish Malt Whisky \u2013 \"The Spirit of Free Embo\". The Battle of Embo occurred in 1245 between Scots and Vikings."

      "caption": "Dornoch Cathedral. he cathedral's churchyard is adjoined by Dornoch Castle, the somewhat reconstructed remains of the medieval palace of the Bishops of Caithness. It was formerly a Catholic Cathedral. The cathedral was dedicated to its founder, St. Gilbert and was built in 1224, in the reign of King Alexander II (1214\u201349) and the episcopate of Gilbert de Moravia (died 1245) (later Saint Gilbert of Dornoch) as the cathedral church of the diocese of Caithness (moved to Dornoch from Halkirk). William de Moravia (later Sutherland), 1st Earl of Sutherland, was buried in the cathedral in 1248. In 1570, the cathedral was burnt down by the Mackays of Strathnaver during local feuding. Full renovations were not carried out until 1835\u201337, by the architect William Burn, funded by Elizabeth the Countess of Sutherland at a cost of \u00a315,000 (equivalent to \u00a31,450,000 in 2021). Among the renovations carried out, the ruined but still largely intact aisled medieval nave was demolished and a new narrow nave without pillars built on its site. In the 17th century, Dornoch ceased to be the seat of the Bishops of Caithness due to the abolition of the episcopate in the Church of Scotland, but the name has remained due to this historical association. On 30 September 1866, the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland were present to welcome the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Duke of Edinburgh, who attended the morning service. The interior was reordered between 1924 and 1926 by Rev. Charles Donald Bentinck, with the removal of Victorian plasterwork to reveal the stonework (although the medieval church would have been plastered throughout). The site of the medieval high altar was raised and converted into a burial area for the Sutherland family, who introduced large marble memorials."

      "caption": "Dornoch Castle. Dornoch Castle was built around 1500 as the home of the bishops of Caithness. Bishop Robert Stewart gifted the castle to John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland in 1557. In 1570 the castle was set alight in a feud between the McKays and Murrays. The rebuilding which followed included the addition of the upper part of the tower. The castle decayed during the 18th century, but was restored in 1813\u20131814 to serve as a school and jail. In 1859-60 it became a court house, and was made the headquarters of the Sheriff of Sutherland with extensive remodelling by William Fowler. Further alterations were made around 1880, including the heightening of the south-west block, and the addition of a three-storey east tower. Following the restoration the castle became a hunting lodge for visiting sportsmen. In 1947 it became a hotel. The Dornoch Castle Hotel has 24 rooms, including suites, and garden rooms, which were built in the 1970s. In addition, there are several personalized rooms and a restaurant. The castle is a category B listed building. The Castle is believed to have been haunted by the ghost of Andrew McCornish who was hanged for sheep stealing. The building passed into private hands in 1922, and became a hotel in 1947. It is now the Dornoch Castle Hotel."
