  "description": "This village in Surrey is in a nice location for exploring the Surrey Hills and Greensand Ridge. This circular walk takes you to some of the highlights of the area including the expansive woodland of Hurt Wood, the iconic Leith Hill and the pretty Abinger Common. The route runs for a distance of just over 10 miles with some moderate climbs on the way. The walk starts in the village and heads south through Hurt Wood where you can see lots flowering Rhodedendron in the spring months. At the Duke of Kent School you can pick up the Greensand Way. The long distance, waymarked trail will guide you east through Pasture Wood and then up on to the summit of Leith Hill. The hill is the highest point in the South East and the highest hill on the Greensand Ridge.  On the summit of Leith Hill is an 18th century Gothic tower, with panoramic views northwards to London and south to the English Channel. After taking in the views the route turns north towards Broadmoor before heading west to Abinger Common. Here you'll find miles of nice woodland trails, ponds, streams and great views from the many viewpoints on the expansive common. The route continues west, passsing the village of Holmbury St Mary, before a final woodland section takes you back into Peaslake.",
