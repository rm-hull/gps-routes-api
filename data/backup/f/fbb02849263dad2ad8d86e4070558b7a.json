  "description": "This walk takes you along the lovely Loch Rannoch in Pitlochry in Perth and Kinross. The freshwater loch is part of the Loch Rannoch and Glen Lyon National Scenic Area. The walk starts at the eastern end of the loch in the village of Kinloch Rannoch where parking is available. The route then follows a country lane along the southern end side of the water, passing the war memorial viewpoint before entering the Rannoch Forest. There's miles of forestry trails here, taking you along the Carie Burn to Carie. The area of forestry is known as the Black Wood of Rannoch, a fragment of the old Caledonian Forest. It is designated as a Special Area of Conservation and includes a number of rare plants. You can look out for wildlife including Scottish crossbill and capercaillie in this interesting area. Head north along the River Ericht and you could visit the nearby Loch Ericht to extend your walking in the area. There's another nice waterside path here with excellent views towards Ben Alder.",
