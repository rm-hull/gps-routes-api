  "description": "This South Gloucestershire based village is located just to the west of Yate and not far from the city of Bristol. Features in the pretty village include an historic church, riverside walks, a lovely garden centre and a noteworthy pub dating back to the 17th century. This circular walk from the village takes you south to pick up a section of the Frome Valley Walkway . The waymarked footpath can be followed along the River Frome towards Yate or Frampton Cotterell. This walk takes you past the picturesque mill pond at Algars Manor before heading along the river to the Tubbs Bottom detention reservoir. You can then follow Nibley Lane back into the village.",
