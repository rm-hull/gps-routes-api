  "description": "Explore the wonderful 1000 acre deer park on this walk or cycle in Knutsford, Cheshire. The route takes you around Tatton Hall, Tatton Mere and the beautiful Italian and Japanese gardens (see video below).  Also of interest is the rare-breed farm with cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, goats and donkeys to see up close. Tatton Park was the winner of Cheshire's Large Visitor Attraction of the Year 2009 and 2010. Cycles can be hired in the park for reasonable rates too.",
