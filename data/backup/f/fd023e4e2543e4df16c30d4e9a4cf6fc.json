  "description": "Enjoy meadows and lagoons in this pretty country park near Chesterfield. The park is a haven for wildlife -  look out for water voles, grass snakes and butterflies. Grassmoor is the start of the Five Pits Trail so there is scope for continuing your walk or cycle. If you follow the trail east you will soon come to Williamthorpe Ponds Nature Reserve. It makes a nice extension to your outing with ponds, reed beds, maturing woodland and lots more wildlife to see.",
