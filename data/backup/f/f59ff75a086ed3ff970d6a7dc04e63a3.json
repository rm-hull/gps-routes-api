This was at one time the point where the Nottingham Canal joined the Cromford Canal, which in turn joined the Erewash Canal below the lock out of shot to the left. The Erewash Canal nowadays provides the only navigable access to this location. Until the 1990s this scene would have been in Nottinghamshire rather than Derbyshire, the area technically being known as Langley Bridge. The boundary was changed to follow a more logical course along the Eastwood by-pass rather than the River Erewash thus bringing the whole of Langley Mill into one parish."

This section of the canal runs from Cromford to Ambergate and is designated as a Biological\u00a0Site of Special Scientific Interest\u00a0and a\u00a0Local Nature Reserve. The walk passes the Leawood Pump House by the aqueduct over the River Derwent and a series of pretty bridges. You'll also pass Shining Cliff Woods and enjoy lovely views of the Derwent Valley. The walk makes use of the Derwent Valley Heritage Way so you could continue along this long distance walking route to extend your walk. The canal is located just a few miles south of Matlock .",
