  "description": "Climb to one of the most popular hills in the Lake District on this wonderful walk from the town of Keswick. It's about 3.5 mile hike from the centre of town, using the Cumbria Way, the Allerdale Ramble and other public footpaths to take you to the summit. The direct path to the hill is fairly easy with a little bit of scrambling as you approach the summit. This longer loop returns via a lakeside path through Manesty Park and Brandelhow Park but you can easily return the same way if you prefer. The walk starts in the town centre of Keswick on Main Street. Here you can pick up the Cumbria Way to cross the River Greta and head west to Stormwater Bridge. Here you turn south, crossing the river again and heading past Portinscale to Fawe Park. Follow the woodland trails before climbing to Skelgill Bank and then on to the Catbells Summit at 451 metres (1,480 ft). From here there are fabulous views over the nearby lakes of Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite. After taking in the views the route then descends to Manesty Park where you can pick up a nice lakeside trail. Follow this for about a 1.5 miles before picking up the same paths and returning to the town. To extend your walking in the area head north from Derwent Bridge along the Allerdale Ramble to Bassenthwaite Lake .",
