On the eastern face of Marcle Ridge, a massive landslip took place over three days starting on 17 February 1575. Named \"The Wonder\", it was so large that full-grown trees were carried down the slope onto an adjoining property. You can find it marked on the OS map just north of the circular walk."

  "description": "Climb to Marcle Ridge and enjoy splendid views towards the Malvern Hills on this circular walk in Herefordshire. It's a lovely area with attractive woodland areas and interesting plants such as orchids and spurge laurel to look out for. From the elevated position on the ridge there are super views of the Cotswold Hills, the Wye Valley, the Brecon Beacons and the Black Mountains. There's a parking area off Glowson Wood Rd where you can start your walk. Please note this car park is privately owned with permission granted by the owners for walkers to use it. As such please respect the space as it is not cleaned or managed by the council. Pick up the footpath here and follow it north through Hoar Wood to Hooper's Oak. The route then turns west and then south to Hyde Common and Lyndalls Wood. The final section takes you along Ridge Hill before returning to the car park where there is a picnic area nearby. The Three Choirs Way and the Herefordshire Trail both pass Marcle Ridge so it's easy to extend your walking in the area. If you head north west along the Three Choirs Way you could visit Broadmoor Common and Haugh Woods where there's lots more footpaths and wildlife to look out for. Heading north will take you across Marcle Hill to Woolhope Cockshoot.",
