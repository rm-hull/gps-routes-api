  "description": "This circular walk visits these two pretty tarns in the beautiful Borrowdale area of the Lake District. There's great views of Great Gable and Great End\u00a0as you make your way to the tarns. The route also passes the impressive Taylor Gill Force\u00a0waterfall which is one of the highest falls in the national park. You'll probably see lots of other walkers as they climb to Scafell Pike via Styhead Tarn. The route starts at the Seathwaite car park and follows the Styhead Gill to the Taylor Force Waterfall and Styhead Tarn. You then turn left and head towards Sprinkling Tarn where you reach a height of over 2000ft. The route then descends to Sprinkling Crags before following the pretty Grains Gill back to Seathwaite. To extend your walk you can climb to Scafell Pike on the famous Corridor Route. You could also pick up the long distance Allerdale Ramble and enjoy a climb to Castle Crag where there are great views over Derwent Water.",
