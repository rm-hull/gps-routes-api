  "description": "Follow over 4 miles of walking paths in these stunning Cornish gardens. There are 26 acres of sub-tropical gardens to explore and a secluded private beach on the banks of the River Helford. Highlights include the stunning Water Garden built around a natural spring that flows downhill through a series of pools, over steep cascades and surrounded with a lush planting scheme. There's also the beautiful Hydrangea Valley leading to the tranquil Mallard Pond with its pretty bridge. The beach is also a delight with views of the River Helford and out to sea. You can enjoy refreshment in the pretty Boathouse Cafe by the beach. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the adjacent Glendurgan Garden where you will find more beautiful gardens and a wonderful maze. The South West Coast Path also runs past the site so you could pick up the trail and head north east to Falmouth . From Helford Passage you can catch the ferry to the southern side of the river and try our circular Helford River Walk . There's great views over the beautiful estuary, pretty creeks, lovely beaches and nice villages with historic churches to see here.",
