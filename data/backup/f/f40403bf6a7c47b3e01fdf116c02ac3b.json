  "description": "Enjoy a visit to Dun Laoghaire Pier and Harbour on this popular coastal walk in Dublin. The walk starts from the Dun Laoghaire Baths Car Park on Windsor Terrace. From here you can head west past the People's Park. The park is well worth a visit with attractive gardens, a fountain and a cafe where you could enjoy some refreshments after the walk. You can also see some singers/artists perform here on certain days. From here it is a short stroll to the East Pier which was constructed in the early part of the 19th century. As you walk along the pier you will pass the Bandstand and the little fish and chips hut. There's splendid views of the town and out to sea from this exposed and scenic location. At the end of the pier there's also the photogenic East Pier Lighthouse which was completed in 1842.",

On the way you'll pass a number of pretty locks, hsitoric buildings and the statue of Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh. There's also the the Dublin River Liffey Boardwalk. The pleasant boardwalk trail passes a number of historic bridges and interesting old buildings in the heart of the city. Just to the north you can pick up the Dublin Coastal Walk which takes you along the shared cycling and walking path in Clontarf. The walk additionally visits the lovely St Anne's Park where there's a rose garden, ponds and walks along the Naniken River. To the south you can pick up the epic Dublin Mountains Way in Shankill. The popular waymarked trail takes you west into the stunning scenery of the Wicklow Mountains."
