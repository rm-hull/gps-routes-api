In 1880 the brick roundhouse of the disused mill was converted into a Chapel of Ease to St Mary's Parish Church, Reigate and is now probably the only mill in the world to have been consecrated as a place of worship. The chapel, named St Cross Chapel, was opened for services on 14 September 1880 and has continued to this day when services are held throughout the summer."

  "description": "This walk explores Reigate Heath on the western side of the town. The heath is criss crossed with a number of footpaths taking you across heather and acid grassland. There's also a number of Bronze Age burial mounds and the Reigate Heath Windmill. The building has been restored as a chapel and is thought to be the only windmill in the world which is also a consecrated church. Start the walk from the car park on Flanchford Road. From here you can pick up various footpaths taking you around the heath and the golf course. You'll pass an information board with a map and details of what you can expect to find on the heath. It's a really pretty area and ideal for an easy afternoon stroll. The Greensand Way long distance trail crosses the heath so you could easily pick this up to extend the walk. If you follow it east it will take you to Skimmington, Priory Park and Earlswood Common. You can also visit Reigate Hill and Gatton Park on the North Downs or try the Reigate and Banstead Millennium Trail .",
