  "description": "Explore the delightful gardens and wider estate surrounding this country house in Drewsteignton, Devon.\nThis is one of the classic circular walks in Dartmoor taking you from Castle Drogo to Fingle Bridge along the wonderful Hunters Path. There are fabulous views down the Teign gorge and across Dartmoor on this elevated path. At Fingle Bridge you cross a 16th/17th century packhorse bridge and pick up the River Teign Walk following a splendid waterside path through oak woodland. Lots of little beaches give you the opportunity for a waterside picnic or a little paddle. It's great for wildlife too- look out for salmon and brown trout jumping up the weirs when the river is in spate (high water). \u00a0Kingfishers and woodpeckers\u00a0are other visitors to this beautiful area. Other features on the walk include Hunter's Tor, Sharp Tor, Piddledown Common and Drewston Woods.\nThe area is managed by the National Trust and the route makes use of the Dartmoor Way so the footpaths are generally good. If you head east from Fingle Bridge you can explore the extensive Fingle Woods. It consists of 420 acres of woodland with waymarked trails and the Iron Age Hillfort of Wooston Castle.",
