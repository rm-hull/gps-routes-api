  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the 815\u00a0m (2,674\u00a0ft) summit of the highest hill in the Cheviot hills. The walk begins at the parking area at Langleeford by the Harthope Burn. The route then ascends along public footpaths and with the burn on your left. You continue to Cairn Hill passing the pretty Harthope Linn waterfall on the way. At Cairn Hill you pick up the Pennine Way to take you to the summit. This section takes place on stone slabs through an area of peat bog. At the summit you can enjoy excellent views of the North Sea, the Lake District Fells, Cross Fell and the Lammermuir Hills. You then descend back to Langleeford via Scald Hill. If you'd like to continue your walking in the Cheviots you could climb Windy Gyle or pick up the Pennine Way . The hill is also located close to the town of Wooler where you can enjoy some nice trails around Wooler Common . Near here you can pick up the Harthope Burn which will lead you to the start point for this walk at Langleeford.",
