  "description": "Follow the rivers Ver and Colne on this waterside walk through Hertfordshire. The walk starts at Redbourn and follows the River Ver to the historic town of St Albans with its impressive cathedral and the delightful Verulamium Park. This section of the walk passes along the lovely lake in the park which also has a fascinating history stretching back 2000 years. It is named after the Roman city of Verulamium on which it now stands.  Near here you will also find the Watercress Wildlife Site, a pretty riverside nature reserve. The site has a wide variety of wildlife, including water rails, kingfishers, little grebes and muntjac deer. The path then continues south, joining the river Colne for the final stretch into Watford. This walk has much to enjoy including, lakes, weirs and numerous species of river dwelling wildlife.",
