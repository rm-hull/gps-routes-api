  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this attractive reservoir in the south Pennines. There is a good footpath running around the perimeter of the water with great views of the pretty countryside of Withens Clough and the Stoodley Pike Monument . There is a parking area just to the east of the reservoir. Park here and then follow the Calderdale Way to the reservoir. The walk can be extended by following the Pennine Way to Stoodley Pike . Here you will find the Stoodley Pike monument, built in 1856 at the end of the Crimean War. You can climb the stairs of the monument to a viewing platform and enjoy wonderful views over Calderdale. You could also follow the Pennine Way south west and visit the nearby Warland Reservoir and White Holme Reservoir. The reservoir is located near to the towns of Todmorden and Hebden Bridge , a mile to the west of Cragg Vale.",
