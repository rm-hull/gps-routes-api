The lake lies at the foot of the grassy slope leading down from the Hall. Madingley Hall was built by Sir John Hynde in 1543 and occupied as a residence by his descendants until the 1860s. Queen Victoria once rented the Hall in 1860 for her son Edward (the future King Edward VII) to live in while he was an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge."

  "description": "This walk visits the historic Madingley Hall in the small Cambridgeshire village of Madingley. The hall is now run as a hotel but you could enter the grounds and visit the cafe for afternoon tea. Then walk off your meal in the delightful parkland and gardens which surround the fine 16th-century manor house. There's 7 acres of parkland to explore on a series of pleasant footpaths. The photogenic grounds were designed in the 18th century by the famous landscape gardener \u2018Capability\u2019 Brown. Madingley is located just north west of neighbouring Coton. You could extend your outing by enjoying a stroll around the pretty village which includes the Coton Countryside Reserve. The long distance Harcamlow Way and Wimpole Way can also be picked up in this area.",
