  "description": "This walk visits the historic Madingley Hall in the small Cambridgeshire village of Madingley. The hall is now run as a hotel but you could enter the grounds and visit the cafe for afternoon tea. Then walk off your meal in the delightful parkland and gardens which surround the fine 16th-century manor house. There's 7 acres of parkland to explore on a series of pleasant footpaths. The photogenic grounds were designed in the 18th century by the famous landscape gardener \u2018Capability\u2019 Brown. Madingley is located just north west of neighbouring Coton . You could extend your outing by enjoying a stroll around the pretty village which includes the Coton Countryside Reserve. The long distance Harcamlow Way and Wimpole Way can also be picked up in this area.",
