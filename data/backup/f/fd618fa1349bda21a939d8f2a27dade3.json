  "description": "A circular walk in Billingshurst taking in the Wey and Arun Canal and the River Arun. It's about a 3 mile walk with some nice views of the river and the surrounding West Sussex countryside. The walk starts just to the west of the village at New Bridge where you can pick up the Wey South Path and follow the waymarked trail south west to Guildenhurst Bridge and Lording's Lock on the canal. The route then heads north east following other footpaths along the River Arun to the Brockhurst Brook. You then follow paths north west to return to the New Bridge where the walk finishes.",
