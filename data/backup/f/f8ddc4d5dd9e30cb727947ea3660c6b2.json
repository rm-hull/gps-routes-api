  "description": "The Derbyshire village of Tideswell has a number of good waymarked trails running past it. This walk from the village makes use of the Limestone Link , the Monsal Trail and the Pennine Bridleway to create a circular walk visiting some of the area's highlights. It runs for about 9 miles with some moderate climbs along the way. You'll enoy riverside paths, woodland trails and some splendid limestone scenery. The village has a number of good pubs so you can enjoy some well earned refreshments after your exercise. The walk starts in Tideswell and follows footpaths west to meet up with the Limestone Way . You then head south to the lovely Miller's Dale . The popular beauty spot includes shady wooded valleys, rushing rivers and lots of interesting flora and fauna. The route continues west along the River Wye to Chee Dale where you cross the river to pick up the Pennine Bridleway. Follow it north towards Tunstead before turning east to Wormhill Hill. The trail then crosses the pretty Monk's Dale before returning to the village.",
