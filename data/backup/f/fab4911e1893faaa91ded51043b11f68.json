The park is opposite Otterspool promenade and offers a view of Liverpool's waterfront, including the Anglican Cathedral and the Royal Albert Dock. It is an open, natural space that has been created on the former landfill site at Bromborough Docks. The park is a pleasant place for a stroll with a series of walkways allowing the public to appreciate the wildflowers and other wildlife. The site also includes a small wetland area."

  "description": "This fascinating model village on the Wirral Peninsula has a number of Grade I listed buildings and a delightful riverside park. Port Sunlight was built by Lever Brothers to accommodate workers in its soap factory in 1888. In the centre of the village you can enjoy a walk along the lovely George's Drive where there's fountains, a lake, pretty gardens and a hugely impressive war memorial. After exploring the village head east to the splendid riverside park. The park includes nice surfaced footpaths with a small lake, the River Dibbin and great views across the River Mersey to the city of Liverpool. You can start your walk from one of the car parks near the garden centre on Jubilee Crescent. Then head north to the Lady Lever art gallery passing through the gardens where you will find the war memorial and the Diamond Jubilee Sundial. It's then a short walk east to the riverside park. You could also start your walk from Port Sunlight Train station which is close to the garden centre. The long distance Wirral Circular Trail passes the village so you could pick this up to extend your walking in the Birkenhead area. If you head south along the Eastham Channel it will take you to Eastham Country Park where you will find 100 acres of broadleaved woodland with surfaced walking paths and a cycle track. Use the google street view link below to virtually explore the centre of the village.",
