  "description": "This little village in Kent sits in a fine location on the Greensand Ridge and the streams of the River Bourne. Much of the village lies within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is one of the most expensive places to live in the country with a very high average house price. It's also known for the Grade I listed Fairlawne House which dates from the 17th century. This circular walk from the village uses part of the Greensand Way to visit two of the highlights of the area at Ightham Mote and Knole Park. On the way there's bluebell woodland, hill climbs, beautiful parkland, lovely gardens and excellent views over the area from the elevated position of the ridge. The walk starts in the village next to Shipbourne Common, where you can pick up the Greensand Way and follow the waymarked footpath north west to South Seers Wood and Igtham Mote. After exploring the house the route continues west to Wilmot Hill, Shingle Hill, Rooks Hill, One Tree Hill and Carter's Hill before coming to Knole Park. From the house you then head south east to Fawke Common, Bitchet Common, Stravecrow House and Broadhoath Wood where you pick up the Greensand Way again. You can then follow back past Igtham Mote to Shipbourne.",
