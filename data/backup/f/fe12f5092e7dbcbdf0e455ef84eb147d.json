  "description": "This circular walk visits the beautiful Falls of Shin in the north of Scotland. The picturesque falls are located on the\u00a0River Shin, near the Kyle of Sutherland and the villages of Lairg and Bonar Bridge. The walk starts from the visitor centre and car park. From here it's a short walk to the viewing platform where you can enjoy an excellent view down to the falls where Salmon can be seen leaping during the late summer months. After viewing the falls head west and you can enjoy the circular woodland walk through the Shin Forest. The visitor centre houses a shop and a cafe where you can enjoy some post walk refreshments.",
