These willows will re-grow from the point at which they have been cut; in this case it is at eight to nine feet. The re-growth is vigorous and provides a fantastic habitat for a range of insects and nesting sites for birds. The ditch will also have increased sunlight, improving it for dragonflies and damselflies."

  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Lackford Lakes Nature Reserve near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. There's some pleasant walking trails taking you around a series of picturesque lakes with lot of wildlife to see. There's bird hides dotted around the site where you can look out for birds such as kingfisher, great crested grebe and tufted duck. There's good facilities too, with a free car park, cafe and visitor centre. The site sits right next to West Stow Country Park where you can enjoy more nice paths and visit the interesting West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village. There's also riverside trails along the long distance Lark Valley Path to try. Just north you'll find miles of peaceful woodland cycling and walking trails around the expansive King's Forest .",
