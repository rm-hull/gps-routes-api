  "description": "This walk visits the Falls Of Rha in Uig on the Isle of Skye. The falls are located just north of the bay in Rha Glen on the River Rha. You can park at the car park opposite the police station and then follow the road west for about 100 metres. Just before the river bridge turn north to follow the stepped footpath along the eastern side of the river to the falls which are impressive after rain. The falls are surrounded by woods with the scent of wild garlic prominent. You can continue your walk just to the south of the falls at the Uig Woodland. This peaceful trail takes you through the Glen Conon Nature Reserve with views of the River Connon, the River Rha and Uig Bay. The unique landscape of the popular Fairy Glen is also just a short walk away.",
