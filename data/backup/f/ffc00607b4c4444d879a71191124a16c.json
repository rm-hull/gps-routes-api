  "description": "This Essex based town has some nice waterside footpaths along the local creek and river to try. The area is particularly good for wildlife watchers with many different species to be seen around these waterways. This walk from the town takes you along the River Crouch to the neighbouring town of Battlesbridge. The walk starts from the train station and heads west to Woodham Fenn next to the Fenn Creek, where you can look out for a variety of wildlife. You follow the creek south to the point where it meets with the River Crouch at Marsh Farm Country Park. The park is one of the local highlights with 300 acres of grazing marsh and a wide variety of water loving birds to spot. At the park you cross the river to Hullbridge at the ford. You can then follow a river path west to take you to Battlesbridge.",
