These towering, needle-like rock formations have been sculpted by centuries of wind and wave erosion and are among Scotland's most impressive coastal features. The stacks are best viewed from the cliff-top path leading from the lighthouse, offering sweeping views of the rugged coastline."

Built in 1924 by David Alan Stevenson, the lighthouse stands 11 metres tall and, despite its modest size, plays a crucial role in guiding vessels through the treacherous waters of the Pentland Firth. Though the lighthouse is automated today, it remains an iconic structure, visible from miles around and a key feature of the local landscape."

  "description": "This walk visits Duncansby Head, the most northeasterly part of both the Scottish and British mainlands. The headland is located just to the northeast of the more famous John O' Groats. It includes a circular walk where you can visit the lighthouse and enjoy views to the Duncansby Stacks, three prominent sea stacks located off the headland. On the way you can look out seabirds, including puffins, fulmars, and kittiwakes. Marine life such as seals and dolphins can also be spotted on the walk. There is a parking area at the head where you can start your walk. The trail runs for just over a mile, climbing to Duncansby Head at a height of 63 metres. Alternatively there is a coastal path you can follow east from John O' Groats for about 1 mile to reach the site. To continue your walking in the area head west to visit Dunnet Head , the most northerly point of both mainland Scotland and the island of Great Britain.",
