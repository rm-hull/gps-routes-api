  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Sale Fell near Cockermouth in the Lake District National Park. You can start the walk from the parking area just to the west of Bassenthwaite Lake at Wythop. From here you can pick up footpaths heading west up to Dodd Crag before turning east to visit the Sale Fell summit which stands at a height of 359 m (1,178 ft). There's great views back down to Bassenthwaite and over to the surrounding fells, including Skiddaw and Helvellyn. The Isle of Man and the Solway Coast are also visible on a clear day. After taking in the views the route then descends back to the parking area via an old quarry.",
