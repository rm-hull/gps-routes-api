  "description": "This coastal country park is located near Dover on the Kent coast. The park was created by using chalk marl from the Channel Tunnel excavations. There are fabulous views of the stunning Shakespeare Cliff and the Strait of Dover. The park is a Nature Reserve with a huge variety of wildlife and a number of nationally rare plant species including the Early Spider Orchid. The North Downs Way long distance trail runs right past the park. you can pick this up and head west to visit East Cliff and Warren Country Park. Here you'll find more great views and three old Martello Towers. Our Folkestone Walk starts at Lower Leas Coastal Park and takes you to all three of Folkestone's coastal park. You could also continue to Folkestone on our Dover to Folkestone Walk which takes you between these two Kent ports.",
