  "description": "This fine town in County Durham has some excellent walking opportunites with the River Wear and River Gaunless running through the town. There's also the expansive parkland surrounding the splendid castle and plenty of attractive country walks in the surrounding countryside. This circular walk around Bishop Auckland makes use of the Brandon - Bishop Auckland Walk and Weardale Way long distance paths. It also visits the historic Auckland Castle and park which is one of the highlights of the area. Start the walk in the town centre and then follow the Brandon - Bishop Auckland Walk north out of the town along a disused railway path. It takes you to the River Wear where you can enjoy waterside paths south of Willington. In this area you will also pass the picturesque Hunwick Gill where there are pretty waterfalls at the point where it flows into the Wear. At Hunwick you can then follow the Weardale Way long distance trail back towards the town. On the way back the route heads east along the river to visit Auckland Castle and Jock's Bridge over the river. For a fee you can explore the castle grounds which include a deer park, a walled garden, woodland trails and river paths. Other walks around the town include the Auckland Walk which takes you along a disused railway line to Spennymoor. If you head west out of the town along the Weardale Way you can visit Marston Lake.",
