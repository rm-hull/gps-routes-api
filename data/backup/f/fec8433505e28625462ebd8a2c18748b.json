The pond and pasture combine to make an attractive natural space adjacent to the village.\"\nThe pasture is used for cattle grazing and the reserve is managed by the Notts Wildlife Trust.

  "description": "This picturesque Nottinghamshire village is located in a pleasant rural spot in between Nottingham and Southwell . The historic village includes a railway station\u00a0on the\u00a0Nottingham to Lincoln Line, a Grade I listed church that dates back to the 13th century times and a few nice pubs to relax in after your exercise. This circular walk takes you west of the village to explore the attractive countryside in the valley of the Cocker Beck. The walk starts in the village and heads west, passing the old hall and the church. You continue west along a footpath before turning south to pick up a trail along the Cocker Beck. This will take you towards the neighbouring village of Lambley where you could pay a visit to the lovely Lambley Dumbles . This route heads north along Green Lane before turning east along a bridleway which runs past the Lowdham Grange prison. Shortly after you return to Lowdham.",
