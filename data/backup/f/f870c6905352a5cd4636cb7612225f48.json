  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around the lovely Fewston Reservoir in the Yorkshire Dales. The path around the reservoir is well surfaced and largely flat so this is a good walk for abilities. The reservoir is surrounded by woodland and beautiful widlflowers including common vetch, betony, milkwork golden rod and common cow-wheat. Also look out for birds on the water including Moorhens, Geese and Ducks. This walk starts at Blubberhouses at the northern end of the reservoir and follows the waterside footpaths around the reservoir. The circular trail runs for a distance of just over 3.5 miles so should take around 1-2 hours to complete. It's easy to extend your walk by heading to the adjacent Thruscross Reservoir. A lovely footpath along the River Washburn will take you there. Swinsty Reservoir is also just to the south and also has an easy circular footpath. Fewston Reservoir is located near to Leeds and Harrogate.",
