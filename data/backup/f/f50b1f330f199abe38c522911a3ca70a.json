  "description": "This circular walk explores the wonderful Sychnant Pass near Conwy in North Wales. The pass runs through the stunning scenery of the Snowdonia National Park from Conwy to Penmaenmawr via Dwygyfylchi. There's lots of great walking trails with stunning views towards the Welsh Coast and the Isle of Anglesey. This circular walk starts from the car park near the Pensychnant Conservation Centre and explores the surrounding hills and mountains on a series of footpaths. From the car park you can pick up the North Wales Path and follow the waymarked footpath south past Capelulo, Maen Esgob and Waen Gyrach. Here you turn west to follow trails up to Foel Lus where you can climb to the 362 metre high summit for some excellent coastal views. The next section you along the Jubilee Trail, an elevated path created for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. The path bends around Foel Lus before heading north past Capelulo to return to the car park.",
