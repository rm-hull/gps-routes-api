Croxteth Hall and Country Park is at the heart of what was once a great country estate stretching hundreds of square miles and was the ancestral home of the Molyneux family, the Earls of Sefton from the sixteenth century until the death of the last Earl in 1972. The Molyneux family are one of the oldest in England, associated with Liverpool since 1296 and governors of Liverpool Castle for centuries. Gifted to Merseyside in 1974 by the late Lady Sefton, it is now managed by The City of Liverpool and although much of its farmland and woods have been sold for housing, it is one of the major heritage centres of the North West with a museum, education centre, walled garden, home farm with rare breeds, a lake and countryside walks. Croxteth Hall is mainly 18th century but it embodies other periods, the oldest being Elizabethan."

This tradition continues today, with the Farm holding a collection of some of Britain's rarest breeds of livestock, including cattle sheep and pigs which is open to the public daily, a particular favourite with children."
