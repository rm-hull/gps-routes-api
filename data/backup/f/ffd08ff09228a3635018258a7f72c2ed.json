  "description": "This former colliery site has been converted into a beautiful country park and a haven for wildlife. Weetslade hill rises to a height of 95m giving fabulous views of the surroundiing countryside, the North Sea, the Cheviots and Newcastle Upon Tyne city. You can cycle or walk along the tracks in the park towards the nearby Big Waters Nature Reserve where you can see a wide variety of birdlife. The park also contains three developing reed beds, which are now home to many common damselflies and dragonflies. Weetslade is located just a few miles north of Newcastle City centre near Gosforth Park and Cramlington. You could continue your walking from the park by heading a couple of miles north to visit Northumberlandia. Here you can enjoy a climb to the Lady of the North, a huge sculpture commanding fine views over the area.",
