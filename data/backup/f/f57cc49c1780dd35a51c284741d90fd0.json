  "description": "Great Gable is one of the most popular mountains in the Lake District for climbers. It's a steep ascent with rugged paths, a fair amount of scrambling and some of the most spectacular rock scenery in the Lake District. This circular walk starts at the car park at Seathwaite and ascends to Stockley Bridge following Grains Gill along the way. You continue to Greenhow Knott where you will pass the beautiful Taylor Gill Force waterfall which drops an impressive 140 feet into the Seathwaite Valley. The next section takes you along Styhead Gill to the lovely Styhead Tarn turning north west to the summit of Great Gable. The views from the peak are spectacular - you can see Ennerdale and Crummockdale, Pillar, Looking Stead, Haycock, Haystacks, High Crag, High Stile and Red Pike ridge. The descent takes you through Great Gable's less famous (but still impressive) neighbour Green Gable, Mitchell Cove and Gillercomb. The final section runs along Sourmilk Gill to the finish point at Seathwaite car park.",
