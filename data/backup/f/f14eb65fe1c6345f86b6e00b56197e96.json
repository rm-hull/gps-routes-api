  "description": "This area of rare lowland heathland is located in the village of Gentleshaw in Staffordshire. There's miles of good footpaths to follow around the expansive site. On the way there's some nice views of the surrounding countryside and lots of wildlife to see. Look out for meadow pipit, common lizard and green hairstreak butterfly as you make your way along the paths. In the late summer there's also lots of pretty heather as well as bilberry, cowberry and beautiful fine grasses. You can continue your walking in the nearby Chasewater Country Park which lies just to the south. There's a splendid waterside trail around the large lake here.",
