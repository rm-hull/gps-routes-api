On the board you can see a quote from lecturer Adam Walker (1730-1821) who wrote that the \"beautiful rock is like the age-tinted wall of a prodigious castle, the stone is very white and from the ledges hang various shrubs and vegetables, which with the tints given it by the bog water gives us a variety that I never before saw\". The board also details how a huge waterfall once poured over the top of the cove as massive glacier mellted on the land above it. Recent excavations show the cove may have formed 50000 years ago."

  "description": "This super walk visits two well known beauty spots in the Yorkshire Dales. The hike to the cove and tarn is one of the most popular walks in Yorkshire. The cove was exposed to a global audience when featured in the flim 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 1)'. It was used as the hideout for Harry and Hermione when they fled there to avoid capture. It begins at the village of Malham and follows the Pennine Way to the stunning Malham Cove. The cove is a huge curved cliff formation of limestone rock with a vertical cliff face of about 260 feet high. It was formed by a waterfall carrying meltwater from glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age more than 12,000 years ago. There are also fabulous views across the Yorkshire Dales from the high point. From the cove you continue to climb towards the beautiful Malham Tarn. The tarn is owned by the National Trust and is also a designated nature reserve. The circular walk takes you around the tarn on footpaths and country lanes before returning to Malham village on the Pennine Way. An alternative route takes you to the tarn via the spectacular Gordale Scar where you will find two waterfalls and overhanging limestone cliffs over 100 metres high. The geologically fascinating area also includes the lovely Janet's Foss waterfall where you can enjoy a walk along a pretty beck and through garlic scented woodland. To extend the walk you can continue north along the Pennine Way and visit Fountains Fell and and Fountains Fell Tarn. The cove is located about 6 miles east of the town of Settle. You could reach the site by following our Settle to Malham Cove Walk which starts from the train station.",
