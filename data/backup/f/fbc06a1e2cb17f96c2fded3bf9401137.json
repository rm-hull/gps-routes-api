Its name is derived from the Gaelic D\u00f9n Mh\u00e8ad, meaning \"Hill of the Maeatae,\" an ancient tribe that inhabited the region. Dumyat is a popular hillwalking destination, particularly for its accessible routes and the striking views it offers of the Forth Valley, Stirling, and the distant Highlands. The summit is marked by a cairn and a memorial to soldiers of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders regiment."

  "description": "This walk climbs to Dumyat from Stirling University in a steady ascent offering excellent views of the surrounding countryside. Starting at the university buildings, the route follows a well-defined trail through wooded areas, gradually emerging onto open hillside. The path is clear and suitable for walkers of moderate fitness, with occasional rocky sections. As you approach the summit, enjoy panoramic views of the Forth Valley, Stirling Castle, and the Ochil Hills. The return follows the same route, making this a manageable yet rewarding hike. To continue your walking in the area head a short distance east to pick up the lovely walk through the Menstrie Glen. There's also the climb to the historic Wallace Monument, just to the south of the university.",
