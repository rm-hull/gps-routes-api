  "description": "Enjoy a walk between these two pretty villages in West Sussex. The route follows a section of the Monarch's Way long distance trail. It runs for just under 5 miles, passing The Trundle Hillfort on St Roche's Hill on the way. Start the walk in the village of West Dean where there's some nice walks in West Dean Park with views of the impressive College. There's also the lovely West Dean Gardens which are a popular local attraction and well worth a visit. Here you'll find a fine Edwardian pergola, Victorian glasshouses and a walled kitchen garden. From the village you head south east along the waymarked footpath through the arboretum before climbing St Roche's Hill. On the hill sits The Trundle, an Iron Age hill fort commanding wonderful views to the coast and the Isle of Wight. It's also a great viewpoint for Goodwood Racecourse which lies just to the east of the hill. After taking in the views the route descends past the famous Goodwood Racecourse. You then turn north to pass through the woodland around Park Hill before coming into East Dean where the walk finishes. This walk passes through part of Goodwood Country Park where there miles of excellent walking trails to try.",

This easy shared cycling and walking trail runs along the old Midhurst and Chichester railway to Chichester via the River Lavant Valley. Head north west and you could visit a splendid viewpoint at Harting Down. There's also the nearby village of South Harting where you could pay a visit to the National Trust's Uppark. Here you'll find a fine 17th century Georgian House surrounded by lovely gardens with views of the English Channel. The author H.G Wells stayed in the house during the late 19th century. The class divisions he observed here inspired his socialist views which later manifested themselves in work such as 'The Time Machine'. You can find the house at postcode GU31 5QR."
