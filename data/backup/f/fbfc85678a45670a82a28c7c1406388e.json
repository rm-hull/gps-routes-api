  "description": "Enjoy a walk between these two pretty villages in West Sussex. The route follows a section of the Monarch's Way long distance trail. It runs for just under 5 miles, passing The Trundle Hillfort on St Roche's Hill on the way. Start the walk in the village of West Dean where there's some nice walks in West Dean Park with views of the impressive College. There's also the lovely West Dean Gardens which are a popular local attraction and well worth a visit. Here you'll find a fine Edwardian pergola, Victorian glasshouses and a walled kitchen garden. From the village you head south east along the waymarked footpath through the arboretum before climbing St Roche's Hill. On the hill sits The Trundle, an\u00a0Iron Age\u00a0hill fort\u00a0commanding wonderful views to the coast and the Isle of Wight. It's also a great viewpoint for Goodwood Racecourse\u00a0which lies just to the east of the hill. After taking in the views the route descends past the famous Goodwood Racecourse. You then turn north to pass through the woodland around Park Hill before coming into East Dean where the walk finishes. This walk passes through part of Goodwood Country Park where there miles of excellent walking trails to try.",
