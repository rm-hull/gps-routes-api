  "description": "This challenging walk takes you to the summit of Garth Hill or Mountain near Cardiff. The hill is thought to be the inspiration for the fictional hill featured in the film 'The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain' starring Hugh Grant. The walk begins in the village of Taff's Well and follows the Taff Ely Ridgeway Walk to the 307 m (1,007 ft) summit. Here you can enjoy fantastic views of Cardiff, the Bristol Channel and the Taff Valley. You will also find a number of burial sites dating from the early to middle Bronze Age, around 2000 BC. You descend on country lanes, crossing the River Taff and finishing back in Taff's Well. To extend your walking in the area just head a mile to the east and visit Castle Coch and Fforest Fawr .",
