    "description": "This challenging walk takes you to the summit of Garth Hill or Mountain near Cardiff. The hill is thought to be the inspiration for the fictional hill featured in the film 'The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain' starring Hugh Grant. The walk begins in the village of Taff's Well and follows the Taff Ely Ridgeway Walk to the 307 m (1,007 ft) summit. Here you can enjoy fantastic views of Cardiff, the Bristol Channel and the Taff Valley. You will also find a number of burial sites dating from the early to middle Bronze Age, around 2000 BC. You descend on country lanes, crossing the River Taff and finishing back in Taff's Well. To extend your walking in the area just head a mile to the east and visit Castle Coch and Fforest Fawr .",

The Pontypridd Walk uses part of the Taff Trail and a section of the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk to create a circular walk through the area. It also climbs to Mynydd Meio which is another good climb you can do in the area. Just to the west of Pontypridd there's Barry Sidings Country Park at Trehafod. There's some popular woodland mountain bike trails and lovely walks along the park's streams and waterfalls. There's also good views of the River Rhonnda at the northern end of the park. Head west along the Taff Ely Ridgeway and you can visit the town of Llantrisant, headquarters of the Royal Mint. There's nice trails here through the Llantrisant Forest to the viewpoints above the town."
