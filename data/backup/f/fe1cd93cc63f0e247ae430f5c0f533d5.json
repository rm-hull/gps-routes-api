  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Llyn Nantlle Uchaf in the Nantlle valley. There are fine views over the picturesque lake to Snowdon. The lake is located near Caernarfon and is one of few lakes in Wales where you can fish for Salmon and Sea Trout from a boat. On the southern side of the water you can follow a footpath along the Snowdonia Slate Trail which runs through the area. The circular long distance trail can be used to visit several of the other historic mining areas located in the World Heritage Site. The walk can be extended to visit the Dorothea Quarry which lies just to the west of the lake. If you head east you can pick up the Nantlle Ridge Walk and visit Mynydd Mawr for wonderful views over the area. There's also more waterside walking to be found along the beautiful Llyn Celyn near here.",
