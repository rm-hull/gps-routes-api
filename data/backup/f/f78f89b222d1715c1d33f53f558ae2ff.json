  "description": "This walk explores the area arond the pretty Anglesey town of Llangefni. The settlement is the county town of Anglesey and contains the principal offices of the Isle of Anglesey County Council. It's a fine place for a walk with an attractive town centre, river trails and wildlife rich local nature reserve to visit. This walk from the village follows a section of the Lon Las Cefni trail to the nearby Cefni Reservoir. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along the Afon Cefni to the reservoir. Here you can enjoy a splendid circular trail around the water with some glorious views to the surrounding countryside and the mountains of Snowdonia. The route also visits the Dingle Nature Reserve which lies just north of the village. Here you can try the tree lined boardwalk and look out for a variety of interesting wildlife. Red squirrels, herons, buzzards and ducks can be seen on this interesting little trail. It's a lovely spot for a stroll with the riverside paths passing through an attractive woodland gorge. Look out for carpets of bluebells and wood anemones in the spring months.",
