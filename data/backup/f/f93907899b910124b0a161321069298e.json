It has a diverse range of breeding birds and eighteen species of mammal have been recorded, including stoat and weasel. It's also of value for grass snakes, amphibians, fungi and invertebrates."

  "description": "Totteridge is a lovely little village to visit on the outskirts of London in the borough of Barnet . It has a rural feel with a pretty village green, a cricket pitch, some pleasant local countryside and a nearby nature reserve to visit. This circular walk from the village takes you to the Darland's Lake Nature Reserve before heading to Totteridge Common and the Dollis Brook for more waterside trails. The walk starts on the edge of the village where you can pick up footpaths heading south west onto the Darland's Lake Nature Reserve. At the southern end of the reserve there's a small lake with a circular footpath running around the perimeter. The reserve is a little off the beaten track so tends to be a quite a quiet place for a stroll. It's good for flora and fauna with a colony of fritillaries and various birds to see on the lake. After exploring the reserve you head north past Totteridge Common and Totteridge park to meet up with the Dollis Valley Green Walk . You can follow this waymarked footpath east along the Dollis Brook before turning south to return to Totteridge. The brookside trail is another easy path with more wildlife spotting opportunities.",
