  "description": "Explore the award-winning gardens and beautiful 1,200 acre estate surrounding this 15th century castle near Winchcombe in the Cotswolds. There are nine magnificent gardens including the Queens Garden with hundreds of varieties of roses and the Tithe Barn Garden with a tranquil carp pond surrounded by wisteria, primroses, hollyhocks and cardoons. St Mary's Church is surrounded by the White Garden, with peonies, clematis, roses and tulips. It is also contains the grave of Katherine Parr. Several walking routes run past the castle so there is plenty of scope for continuing your walk. The castle is located in the village of Winchcombe, 8 miles from Broadway in the Cotswolds AONB. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the Cotswold Way and follow it south to Belas Knap. The fascinating neolithic, chambered long barrow is only just over a mile from the castle and well worth a visit.",

      "content": "Cleeve Hill is one of the major attractions of the area and located only a few miles west of the castle. It's the highest point of the Cotswolds and commands fine views over the River Severn Valley into Wales. You can reach the hill by following the Cotswold Way National Trail from the castle. Head a couple of miles north east of the castle and you can visit another of the area's historic highlights at Hailes Abbey. The 13th century abbey ruins are now under the care of English Heritage. Our circular walk visits the town from the abbey so could be started/finished in Winchcombe. The Winchcombe Circular Walk also visits the castle from the town. For more walking ideas in the area see the Gloucestershire Walks, Cotswolds Walks page."
