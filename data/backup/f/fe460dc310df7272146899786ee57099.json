      "caption": "View west along stream. This stream separates Hoe Rough (at left) from pastures adjoining on the other side. The concessionary path leading through Hoe Rough forms two loops - one runs along a stream and an adjoining meadow, the other traverses the somewhat higher ground to the east. Unimproved meadows such as these as Hoe Rough Nature Reserve are becoming increasingly rare. A number of old oak trees grow here, one of which is believed to be at least 330 years old. The rough is now continuously grazed by sheep and cattle but the crab apple trees probably originate from the time when pigs foraged here, the seeds having originated from swill fed to them. Hoe Rough Nature Reserve is managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust."
