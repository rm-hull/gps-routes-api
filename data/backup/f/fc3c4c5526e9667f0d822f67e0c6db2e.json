The second palace opened in 1875 and in 1980 this, too, was largely destroyed by fire. I believe there was some discussion as to whether to demolish it completely but it was rebuilt and reopened in 1988. This shows it in 1982 with scaffolding supporting the walls."

  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle through this popular park in North London. The park covers nearly 200 acres and surrounds the historic entertainment venue of Alexandra Palace. It includes a pretty boating lake where you can enjoy a boat ride or a lakeside snack at the cafe. There is a also a large garden centre with a Victorian style greenhouse, a deer enclosure with a small herd of fallow deer and a 10 hole pitch and putt golf course. You can also climb the park's tree-lined sloping hill where you can enjoy super views over London. Alexandra Park is located between Wood Green and Muswell Hill. Alexandra Palace railway station (Muswell Hill branch) is located right next to the eastern end of the park. The Parkland Walk starts in Alexandra Park, so you could pick up this lovely trail to extend your walk. It runs for about 4 miles along the course of an old railway line to Finsbury Park, via Highgate Wood and Crouch End. The long distance Capital Ring also passes just to the south of the park. This will take you on a tour of some of London's best parks and gardens.",
