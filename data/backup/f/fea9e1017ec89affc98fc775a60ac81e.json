The first record of a chalk figure dates from 1710 and the 226 foot figure has been scaled in a way so as not to look short and stumpy from below. Whether the figure dates back to antiquity has been much debated but is generally believed not to. The figure is in the current ownership of the Sussex Archeological Society who received it from the Duke of Devonshire along with nearby Wilmington Priory in 1926."

  "description": "Climb to this iconic hill figure on Windover Hill on this splendid circular walk in the South Downs. The walk begins in the village of Alfriston on the Cuckmere River and follows the South Downs Way to the Long Man. It's a fairly easy climb on a good path with splendid views of the South Downs and the coast to enjoy. From the high point you descend to Litlington passing the delightful Lullington Heath Nature Reserve on the way. It's a lovely area made up of chalk heath with heather, bell heather and gorse bushes. At Litlington you pick up the Vanguard Way and enjoy a lovely waterside section along the Cuckmere River which takes you back to Alfriston. If you enjoy this walk then you could try the Cuckmere River and Cuckmere Haven walk which also starts from Alfriston.",

You can find the pub on the High Street at a postcode of BN26 5SY for your sat navs. The pub is also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you. If you're doing the walk from Wilmington you could head to The Giant\u2019s Rest in the village. The country pub does good food, is dog friendly and also has a beer garden. You can find it at postcode BN26 5SQ."
