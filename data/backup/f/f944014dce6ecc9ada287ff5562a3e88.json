  "description": "This circular walk explores Haworth Moor in the popular Bronte country. The walk visits some of the highlights of the area including Penistone Hill Country Park , Leeshaw Reservoir and the Bronte Waterfall . The route involves a fairly challenging hill climb so a good level of fitness is required. The walk starts from the village of Haworth where you can follow footpaths south west to Penistone Hill Country Park. There's a great viewpoint here with fine views over the moor. You continue west along a section of the Bronte Way . The waymarked footpath takes you past the Lower Laithe Reservoir to the Bronte Waterfall. The picturesque spot was a favourite of the Bronte sisters, who would often spend time contemplating at the falls. You could continue about a mile west from here to visit Top Withens. The ruined farmhouse is said to have been the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. This route continues south west to Harbour Hill and Oxenhope Stoop Hill, which is the high point on the walk. The route then descends to Bond Clough Hill and the pretty Leeshaw Reservoir. The final section runs past Drop Farm before heading through the country park and returning to Haworth.",
