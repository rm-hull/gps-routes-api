  "description": "This circular walk explores the area to the east of the Steel Rigg car park on Hadrian's Wall. It takes you to the famous tree at Sycamore Gap and the fascinating Housesteads Roman Fort on Hadrian's Wall. The walk starts from the Steel Rigg car park at postcode NE47 7AN for your sat navs. From here you can pick up the Hadrian's Wall Path and follow the waymarked trail east to the iconic tree. The photogenic tree sits in a dramatic dip next to Hadrian's wall and was featured in the film 'Robin Hood Prince of Thieves'. The path continues east past the pretty Crag Lough to Hotbank Crags and the Roman Fort at Housesteads.  The fort is one of the highlights on the wall and includes a visitor centre with a wealth of information. The site dates from AD 124 and includes a barracks block, hospital, Commander's House, granaries and communal toilets which are all still visible today. After exploring the fort you continue east past Kennel Crags and Clew Hill to King's Hill. Here you turn north west to pick up an alternative footpath heading west past Broomlee Lough and Ridley Common. Around here you could take a detour north along the Pennine Way to visit Greenlee Lough. This walk continues west past Peatrigg before returning to the car park.",
