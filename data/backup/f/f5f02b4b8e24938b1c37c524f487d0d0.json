  "description": "This is a circular walk through the splendid Lyme Park in Disley, Cheshire. Here you can explore the 1,300 acre estate with its resident deer and enjoy fabulous views of the Peak District. There are also tranquil lakes, peaceful woodland walks and an Edwardian rose garden to enjoy. The park may look familiar as it was used for the BBC production of 'Pride and Prejudice'. The walk begins at the park gate near Disley train station, before exploring the most attractive areas of the park and returning to the start point. The Gritstone Trail long distance path passes through the park so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Heading south will take you towards Bollington via Sponds Hill. Additionally the North Cheshire Way passes through Lyme Park, so you could pick this up and head west towards the village of Adlington, passing the Macclesfield Canal on the way.",
