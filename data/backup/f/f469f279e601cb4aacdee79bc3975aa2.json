  "description": "This Leicestershire village is nicely positioned for some fine canal and country walking. This circular walk from Kibworth Beauchamp takes you to the nearby Saddington Reservoir before heading to the lovely Foxton Locks on the Grand Union Canal. The walk starts by heading south from Kibworth Beauchamp to Smeeton Westerby. Here you can pick up the Saddington Road, a pleasant country lane which will lead you west to Saddington. On the way you'll cross the Grand Union Canal near Saddington Tunnel, where there are pleasant walks along the towpath. This route continues to Saddington village where you can pick up the Leicestershire Round and follow the waymarked footpath to the reservoir. The trail then heads south east to Smeeton Gorse and Gumley before coming to the splendid Foxton Locks. Here you'll find a country park with waterside trails, woodland paths and a photogenic staircase of locks.",
