  "description": "This is a popular riverside walk from the centre of York to the nearby village of Bishopthorpe. The route runs for about 3.5 miles on a flat footpath, running alongside the River Ouse. Start the walk on the Ouse Bridge in the city centre and head south on the Ebor Way. You'll soon come to the lovely Rowntree Park. The riverside park includes lovely canal-side footpaths, ornate statues, a large lake and a water cascade. The walk continues past the impressive York Millennium Bridge which was opened in 2001. You then pass Clementhorpe and the York By Pass before coming to the Bishopthorpe Palace. The fine stately home is located in a photogenic position next to the river. The palace is a Grade I listed building in a wooded, rural setting and includes a gatehouse, stables, a brewhouse and brewster's cottage. It's the official residence of the Archbishop of York. The route then leaves the river and heads around the back of the palace to arrive in Bishopthorpe. Here you will find several pubs where you can stop for refreshment at the end of your walk. To return to York you can catch a bus or return on foot on the opposite side the river. To extend your walk you could continue along the Ebor Way to Tadcaster. Here you can enjoy more riverside walking trails along the River Wharfe and visit the impressive Tadcaster Viaduct .",
