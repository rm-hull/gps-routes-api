  "description": "This super country park is located on the coast at Filey in North Yorkshire. It is also known as North Cliff Country Park. The elevated position of the park provides splendid views over Filey Bay and the town below. The walk also takes you along Filey Brigg - a long narrow peninsula with steep cliffs and lovely coastal views. The Cleveland Way and the Centenary Way walking routes run past the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along the coast to the nearby town of Scarborough. The Scarborough to Filey Walk gives more details on this stretch of coast which is one of the finest in the country.",
