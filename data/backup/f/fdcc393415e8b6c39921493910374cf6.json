  "description": "This walk in the Mourne Mountains takes you along the Trassey Track to the spectacular mountain pass of Hare's Gap. The walk starts from the car parking area on the Trassey Road just to the west of Tollymore Forest Park . From here you pick up the track and head south through Clonachullion Wood. You continue south passing along the Shimna River before coming to Hare's Gap. Along the way there are splendid views of the surrounding mountains and the Mourne Wall which runs through the area. The trail runs for just over 2 miles and is reasonably easy for most of the way. To continue your walking in the area head east from the car park to explore the popular Tollymore Forest Park . There are a number of colour coded trails taking you around the park's peaceful woodland and riverside paths.",
