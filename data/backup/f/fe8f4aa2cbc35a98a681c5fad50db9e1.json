  "description": "This holiday park is located just south west of Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire. You can follow a series of footpaths around the site which includes a number of pretty fishing lakes. There are also public footpaths heading into the surrounding countryside and a lovely tea room where you can enjoy some post walk refreshment. You can continue your walking in the area by heading to the nearby Burrough Hill Country Park and Melton Country Park. There's more lovely lakeside trails with ponds, lakes and weirs to enjoy here. The Mowbray Way, a long distance waymarked trail, can also be picked up in the park and used to further explore the area.",
