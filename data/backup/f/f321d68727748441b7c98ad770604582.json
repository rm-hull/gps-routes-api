  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the hill fort at Foel Fenli in the Clwydian Range of mountains. The hill is located close to the more popular Moel Famau. While not as spectacular it is a worthy climb and somewhat more peaceful than its near neighbour. You can start the walk from the Bwlch Pen Barras parking area located just to the north of the fort. From here you can pick up footpath and a set of stairs leading up to the hill top which stands at a height of 511 metres (1,677 ft). This makes it the second highest peak in the Clwydian Range. On the hill top there are the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort with strong ramparts on all sides and an entrance at the west end. On the walk look out for buzzards soaring above the hill top, as shown in the photo below.",

Here you'll find a tremendous olde worlde atmosphere with low beamed ceilings and in the winter roaring log fires. The pub has a great menu, a nice outdoor seating area with countryside views and is also dog friendly.Also on the Ruthin Road is We Three Loggerheads. This pub is set in a restored 17th century coaching inn with a traditional bar and a beautiful vaulted restaurant."

You can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it north to visit the popular Moel Famau where there are more excellent views and an associated country park.  The circular walk from Maeshafn visits the fort and the nearby Loggerheads Country Park as well. You'll also pass the neighbouring village of Cilcain where there's a significant 13th century church and a fine early 19th century pub to see. For more walks in the AONB see the Clwydian Range Walks page."
