  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the hill fort at Foel Fenli in the Clwydian Range of mountains. The hill is located close to the more popular Moel Famau. While not as spectacular it is a worthy climb and somewhat more peaceful than its near neighbour. You can start the walk from the Bwlch Pen Barras parking area located just to the north of the fort. From here you can pick up footpath and a set of stairs leading up to the hill top which stands at a height of\u00a0511 metres (1,677\u00a0ft). This makes it the second highest peak in the Clwydian Range. On the hill top there are the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort with strong ramparts on all sides and an entrance at the west end. On the walk look out for buzzards soaring above the hill top, as shown in the photo below.",
