  "description": "Visit Rufford Country Park near Mansfield and explore 150 acres of historic parkland. In the park you will find a medieval monastery, a craft centre, formal gardens, woodland walks, a sculpture trail and a lake. Rufford park once formed part of a 12th century Cistercian abbey and its estate. It is now a country house estate surrounded by beautiful gardens and parkland open to the public. The Robin Hood Way Walk passes through the park so you can head north on to the nearby village of Edwinstowe, Sherwood Forest Country Park, Clumber Country Park and Thoresby Park if you have time. Just a couple of miles to the south east there's also Sherwood Pines Forest Park .",
