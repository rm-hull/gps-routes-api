Iken Cliff served as a commercial hub for the shipping of coal and wheat in the days before railroads, and there was a bar close to the water. Wheelbarrows were used to transport goods as flat barges used to sit on the mud at low tide. After World War II, the last remaining heathland around Iken Cliff was ploughed under."

The area was valued more by the estate's owners for shooting than for farming, so a decoy pond was constructed at Iken in the eighteenth century. Iken has remained a \"close\" village ever since the Estate was divided up; very few brand-new homes have been constructed, and no council houses have ever been built."

After the war was over, they relocated and eventually returned."

  "description": "This walk explores the area around the Suffolk village of Iken. The village is in a lovely spot for a stroll with nice trails along the beautiful Snape Maltings and into the nearby Tunstall Forest. This walk starts at the Iken Cliff car park just to the south of Snape village. Here you can pick up a footpath heading east along the Maltings on the River Alde. It will take you past Iken Hall to the noteworthy St Botolph\u2019s Church. It's a lovely church to investigate with a part thatched roof and an ancient nave dating back to the 12th century. In February there's also pretty snowdrops in the churchyard with fine views of the river. The estuary is a great place for bird watching so keep your eyes peeled for a variety of waders as you make you way along the path. The Suffolk Coast Path passes through the village so can be used to further explore the area.",
