  "description": "Bestwood Country Park is located on the outskirts of the city of Nottingham and consists of 650 acres of open green space. The park includes Mill Lakes, where you can follow the waterside trail and look out for the wide variety of water birds that visit the park. There are also wildflower meadows  and peaceful forest trails through ancient oak woodland to enjoy. National Cycle Route 6 runs along Mill lakes and the Robin Hood Way walking trail also runs right through the park. You could follow the trail to the nearby Burntstump Country Park for more pleasant woodland walking trails. Following the trail west would take you to the lovely Collier's Wood Nature Reserve and Moorgreen Reservoir. The reserve is worth visiting with a large pond and good surfaced paths. The Broxtowe Country Way can then be picked up to take you to the nearby reservoir. Just over a mile to the north of the reservoir there's also the noteworthy Felley Priory. The historic 15th century house is surrounded by some beautiful gardens with herbaceous borders, splendid topiary and bluebell woodland.",
