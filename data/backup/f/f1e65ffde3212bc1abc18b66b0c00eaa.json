The clock was installed in September 2006 at the bottom of the pedestrianised section of London Road, thanks to generous support from some local businesses and a 'liveability fund' of Havant Borough Council."

  "description": "This Hampshire based market town is located in the Borough of Havant near Horndean, Rowlands Castle and the city of Portsmouth. Local walking highlights include the peaceful woodland trails around Havant Thicket, Stansted Forest and the Edwardian Stansted Park which lie just to the east. To the west is Creech Woods in the Forest of Bere where there's some good cycling and walking options. All of these expansive forested areas are ideal for easy local dog walks. In nearby Denmead you can pick up the Wayfarer's Walk, a long distance, waymarked footpath which explores the county. Scroll down for the full list of walks near the town.",
