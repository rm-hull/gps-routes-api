It's split into a terraced upper deck and lower deck making it an ideal place to relax on a warm day. You can find the pub in the little village of Beckley on the High St with a postcode of OX3 9UU for your sat navs. The little hamlet of Christmas Common is a lovely place for a pit stop. Here you'll find the popular Fox and Hounds pub. The historic 500-year-old pub is situated on the top of Watlington Hill and is very walker and cyclist friendly. They have a good menu and a very pretty garden area for warmer days. You can find them at postcode OX49 5HL. They are also dog friendly. The village of Middle Assendon has the Rainbow Inn.
