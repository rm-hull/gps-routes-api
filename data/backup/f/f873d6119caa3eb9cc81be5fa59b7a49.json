  "description": "This market town is located in a lovely spot on the edge of the North York Moors in Ryedale. It's well known for its Wednesday market which dates all the way back to the 13th century. In the town there's cobbled streets, interesting old cottages and a Saxon church. For walkers there's some fine traills to follow through the countryside and woodland surrounding the town. This circular walk from the town visits the Manor Vale Woodland Nature Reserve and the village of Gillamoor. Here you can enjoy a climb to Suprise View and enjoy marvellous views over the countryside of the North York Moors. Start the walk in the centre of town and then head north to visit the Manor Vale Woodland Nature Reserve. This Y-shaped dry valley is cut into the Jurassic strata of the Tabular Hills. At the site you'll find semi-natural ash woodland and an abundance of interesting flora and fauna. There's also some nice views of the River Dove which runs through the area. The route continues north along the golf course to High Park Farm and Cockpit Hall. You then follow Woodhead Field Lane into Gillamoor. In the little village you'll find 'Suprise View' where you can enjoy splendid views over Farndale. Nearby there's also an interesting little church which was rebuilt single-handedly in 1802 by James Smith of Farndale. After enjoying the view, the route then descends to Bluegate Hill and Hagg Wood. Here you follow Shepherd's Road through Douthwaite Dale and along the River Dove, before some more woodland trails take you to Low Park Farm. From here you can follow Park Lane back into Kirkbymoorside, passing the ruins of the old castle as you go. Here you could take a slight detour from the route to visit Wawney Wood and Vivers Hill where there are some nice views.",
