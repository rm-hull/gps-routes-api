  "description": "A circular walk from Kingswinford along a disused railway track, visiting Wombourne and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. The walk starts just to the north of the town where you can pick up the South Staffordshire Railway Walk. This shared cycling and walking trail follows the trackbed of the old Wolverhampton to Dudley railway line. Follow the flat path west and it will take you to Himley and the woodland of the Himley Plantation. The trail then heads through Wombourne where this route leaves the rail trail to cross Bratch Bridge. You can continue all the way along the rail trail to Wolverhampton though if you wish. This route heads to the impressive Bratch Locks on the canal. Here you can pick up the towpath and follow it south to Swindon. You then leave the canal to head back to Himley where you can pick up the South Staffordshire Railway Walk and return to the start point near Kingswinford.",

The cafe is set in restored railway station and offers a delicious selection of freshly made food, breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea.

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area head south along the canal on the Kinver Canal Walk and then climb to the popular Kinver Edge for great views over the area.  To the south of the town you can also pick up the Stourbridge Canal and enjoy another easy waterside stroll. To the east you can explore the woodland sculpture trails in the wildlife rich Saltwells Nature Reserve. You will also find the pretty Netherton Reservoir and the Dudley Canal in this area. The canal lies at the southern end of the Victorian Netherton Tunnel. With a torch you can walk through the pitch black tunnel to Dudley Port at the other end. Just to the north there's the 18th century Himley Hall. The historic hall is surrounded by \u2018Capability\u2019 Brown landscaped parkland with woodland walks, waterfalls and a large lake. For more walking ideas in the area see the West Midlands Walks page."
