  "description": "A circular walk from Kingswinford along a disused railway track, visiting Wombourne and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal . The walk starts just to the north of the town where you can pick up the South Staffordshire Railway Walk . This shared cycling and walking trail follows the trackbed of the old Wolverhampton to Dudley railway line. Follow the flat path west and it will take you to Himley and the woodland of the Himley Plantation. The trail then heads through Wombourne where this route leaves the rail trail to cross Bratch Bridge. You can continue all the way along the rail trail to Wolverhampton though if you wish. This route heads to the impressive Bratch Locks on the canal. Here you can pick up the towpath and follow it south to Swindon. You then leave the canal to head back to Himley where you can pick up the South Staffordshire Railway Walk and return to the start point near Kingswinford.",
