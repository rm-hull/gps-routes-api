  "description": "This is a lovely waterside walk along the Grwyne Fawr to Grwyne Fawr Reservoir in the Brecon Beacons. You can start your walk from the Mynydd Du car park and follow the trails north to the reservoir. The rushing waters and the beautiful scenery of the Vale of Grwyney are a real delight. The route climbs to a height of over 1800ft so is quite challenging. You are rewarded with splendid views over the surrounding hillls of the Black Mountains. To extend your walk you could further explore the Mynydd Du Forest with its miles of walking trails and mountain bike tracks to try. Just to the west of the lake you can pick up the Dragons Back circular walk which provides magnificent views over the area. Also nearby is Waun Fach the highest mountain in the Black Mountains. The climb to Mynydd Troed and Cockit Hill from Pengenffordd is also located in this area.",

The picturesque ruins are now under the care of Cadw and entrance is free to the public. The epic Cambrian Way passes the lake. The long distance waymarked route starts from the city of Cardiff and runs for nearly 300 miles through the Brecon Beacons, the Cambrian Mountains and Snowdonia before finishing on the North Wales coast at Conwy.
