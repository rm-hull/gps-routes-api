  "description": "A linear walk on the Dales Way between these two popular Yorkshire towns. The route includes some wonderful limestone scenery and fabulous, far reaching views from the high points. It's about a 6 mile hike, with some moderate climbs along the way. You pick up the Dales Way in the centre of Grassington and head north, climbing to Lea Green, Old Pasture and Conistone Pie. This unusual limestone outcrop is shaped like a pie and commands great views of Wharfedale and Littondale. The route then descends along Swineber Scar toward Scargill House. The house dates from the eighteenth century and is constructed of stone, rendered and colour-washed, under a stone flag roof. It is now used as a Christian conference Centre run by the Scargill Movement. The route then passes Crookacre barn before coming into Kettlewell. You can extend the walk by continuing along the Dales Way through Wharfedale. It's a lovely riverside path which will take you to the village of Buckden where you can try the climb to Buckden Pike. Our Circular Walk around Kettlewell takes you on a tour of some of the area's popular peaks, including Great Whernside, Blackfell Top and Blackfell Dike.",

      "content": "At the end of the route you can pick up the Kettlewell to Starbotton and Arncliffe Walk. This route visits the two neighbouring villages which are both full of character. There's excellent views of the countryside of Wharfedale and the Littondale valley on this walk. Just to the north west of Arncliffe you can pick up the Littondale Walk. This starts from the nearby village of Litton and explores the northern end of the dale with more riverside trails and excellent views. Just to the west of Grassington you'll find the worthy village of Threshfield. The pretty settlement includes an historic 16th century inn and the nearby Threshfield Quarry. The quarry is an unusual and atmospheric place for a walk with its limestone rocky cliffs and distinctive turquoise lakes. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nidderdale Walks page."
