Pentrefoelas is located just a few miles east of the popular village of Betws y Coed where there are numerous walks around Snowdonia. This circular walk from Pentrefoelas explores the countryside around the village using a mixture of country lanes, bridle tracks and public footpaths. On the way there's some lovely views towards the mountains and hills of Snowdonia. You'll also pass along the Afon Merddwr which flows through the village. To continue your walking in the area head a few miles east to Alwen Reservoir where you can pick up the Alwen Reservoir Trail. Near here there's also Llyn Brenig where there are more fine waterside walks to enjoy.",
