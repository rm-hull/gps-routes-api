This process will continue till it cuts back into the bowl the has been cut by the preceding waterfall. This will weaken the slab enough for high water pressure to collapse the slab. Although a large flood could pull off the slab at any time."

The original cairn was built in 1897, Malcolm Ferguson was prominent in its construction. The cairn eventually collapsed but was re-erected, together with original inscribed, polished granite plaque, by the Callander Round Table in 1997. Note the white quartz top to the pyramidal cairn."

  "description": "Enjoy a walk around this popular beauty spot in Callander in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. These wonderful steep falls are set in a beautiful wooded gorge on Keltie Water, just a short walk from the town of Callander. The walk starts at the car park near the falls and follows a good path through woodland to Bracklinn Falls Bridge where there are great views of the foaming river. You continue on the woodland trails on the eastern side of the river before crossing a bridge and following a country lane back to the car park. There's great views of the surrounding Stirlingshire countryside and hills for much of the walk too. To continue your walking in the Callander area head west along the Garbh Uisge River to Loch Lubnaig .",
