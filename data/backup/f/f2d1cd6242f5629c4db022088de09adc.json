Aber Falls has been a site of human settlement since prehistoric times, with archaeological discoveries revealing stone circles and Roman remains nearby. This rather unprepossessing piece of rough ground and stones in the middle of a patch of cleared forest is a bronze age burial cairn (one of various such remains in the area). Moel Wnion can be seen in the background, together with three lines of pylons which carry transmission lines over the hills rather than along the very restricted coastal route. Several standing stones and cairns can also be seen nearby."

  "description": "Follow a splendid walking trail up to the beautiful Aber Falls on this circular walk in the Snowdonia National Park. Aber Falls (Rhaeadr Fawr in Welsh) is located near the village of Abergwyngregyn in Gwynedd. The walk starts at the car park at Bont Newydd and follows the North Wales Path along the Afon Rhaeadr Fawr to the 120 ft high falls. You'll pass through the stunning scenery of the Coedydd National Nature Reserve with its wonderful woodland and mountain scenery. There's also a variety of wildlife to look out for including treecreepers, sparrowhawks, woodpeckers, tree pipits, skylarks and buzzards. If you're lucky you may spot polecats, stoat and lizards too. The walk involves a moderate climb but you're rewarded with magnificent views of the surrounding countryside and mountains from the high points. For a shorter route to the falls see our Aber Falls Easy Walk .",
