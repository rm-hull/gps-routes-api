During the 1940s/50s the number of patients declined and the hospital became a long stay home for the eldery. In 1975 after being empty for several years it became self catering holiday accommodation. Finally in 1995 it was opened by David Bellamy as a Field Centre."

Blencathra, also known as Saddleback for its distinct profile, is a peak steeped in natural and literary history, with Alfred Wainwright devoting more pages to this mountain than any other in his guidebooks. Along the trail, you might spot local wildlife such as kestrels, buzzards, and red squirrels, as well as hardy upland vegetation like heather and bilberry. The summit itself provides panoramic views stretching across the Lake District, with Sharp Edge and other iconic ridges visible in the distance."

  "description": "This is probably the easiest route to the summit of Blencathra. It starts from the public parking area next to the Blencathra Field Studies Centre. As such you have already climbed a few hundred metres in the car before you start walking. From here, the well-marked path heads northeast and spans approximately 2 miles to the summit. The initial climb is moderately steep, taking you past Knowe Crags, but the terrain gradually levels into a gentler ridge walk, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding fells and valleys. This route is straightforward and suitable for most walkers with moderate fitness. Returning to the car park via the same path allows you to appreciate new perspectives on the descent. Nearby, the village of Threlkeld offers welcoming pubs for refreshments after your hike. For a longer walk to the summit see the Blencathra Circular Walk page."
