  "description": "Explore 750 acres of parkland and nature reserve in the heart of Northamptonshire's beautiful Nene Valley. The park has a lovely cycle and walking track passing between the many lakes.  In addition to the circular cycle routes around the lakes there is a four mile linear route running from Irthlingborough towards Thrapston, along a former railway line. Cycle hire is available within the park and there is an excellent visitor centre with interactive displays. The Nene Way walking route passes through the park so you could continue your walk along the River Nene to the nearby town of Wellingborough and the lovely Irchester Country Park. Just to the west you'll find the adjacent Rushden Lakes. There's more lakes, meadows, nature reserves and wildlife to see here. Look out for golden plover, cetti's warblers, coots, oystercatchers and grey herons in this area.",
