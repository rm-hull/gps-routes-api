From the summit there are wonderful views to the Wiltshire Downs, the Mendip Hills and the Black Mountains of Wales. There's also a fine 17th century pub to visit in the village afterwards."

  "description": "Climb this distinctive hill in Warminster and enjoy wonderful views over West Wiltshire and Somerset. The chalk downland of the hill is covered in wildflowers in the summer months. There is a car park about half a mile south of the hill. From here you can pick up the footpath to the hill summit. The hill is located very close to Longleat Park so you can continue your walk here. There are miles of woodland trails, a series of ponds and the famous safari park. You could try the Shearwater Lake Walk which takes you along a 37 acre lake with access to the surrounding forest. A short walk from here is the wonderful Heaven's Gate with fascinating sculptures and wonderful views over Longleat. The Mid-Wilts Way also crosses the hill so you could pick this up and head towards Upton Scudamore or into Longleat Forest. Head east and you will soon come to the town of Warminster. Our Warminster Walk will take you around the Smallbrook Meadows Nature Reserve and the Lake Pleasure Grounds in the town centre.",
