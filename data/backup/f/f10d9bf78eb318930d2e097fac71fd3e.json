  "description": "An easy shared cycling and walking route running from Haswell to Hart. The route runs for just under 10 miles along a disused railway line and National Cycle Route 14. Starting at the public car park in Haswell you first head east to link up with the traffic free trail. You then head south to Shotton Colliery. Near here the route links up with the Castle Eden Walkway, another popular rail trail in the area. You can also explore the Castle Eden Dene Nature Reserve in this area. You continue south east to Monk Hesleden before finishing at Hart, near the coast and Hartlepool.",
