  "description": "This fine Staffordshire village is a worthy place to explore. The village has won best kept village awards and was rated the best place to live in the Midlands by the Sunday Times in 2013 and again in 2016. There's a number of historic listed buildings to see including the half timbered Church House and The Goats Head Inn. This walk from the village uses the Staffordshire Way to visit some of the highlights of the area including Blithfield Reservoir, the Trent and Mersey Canal and Shugborough Park. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Staffordshire Way and follow the waymarked footpath south to Yenbrook and the impressive dam at Blithfield Reservoir. The route continues through the village of Colton before joining up with the canal near Rugeley. You then follow it north west through Colwich and Little Haywood where there are views of the River Trent. You continue to Great Haywood where you can cross the river to visit Shugborough Hall Park.",
