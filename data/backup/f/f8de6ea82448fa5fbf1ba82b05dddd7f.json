The warm Gulf Stream, originating from the American continent, flows between Ireland and Iceland, while cold waters from the Arctic Ocean travel southwards. This dynamic interaction between warm and cold currents contributes to the distinct weather patterns that have continuously shaped the soil and landscape at C\u00e9ide Fields. The site is in UNESCO's tentative list to gain World Heritage status."

The fields themselves offer a glimpse into early human agricultural practices, revealing how ancient communities adapted to and thrived in this challenging environment. The site not only holds archaeological significance but also stands as a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of early farmers in one of Ireland's most strikingly beautiful and weather-beaten regions."

The discovery of the C\u00e9ide Fields in County Mayo, Ireland, began in the 1930s when Patrick Caulfield, a local schoolteacher, made an intriguing observation while cutting peat for fuel. He noticed linear piles of rocks that were clearly arranged in a deliberate manner, rather than occurring naturally. These rocks were found beneath the bog, indicating that they were placed there before the formation of the bog, suggesting an ancient origin. It wasn't until the 1970s that the significance of this discovery was fully realised, thanks to Patrick's son, Seamus Caulfield, who had pursued a career in archaeology. Seamus began to investigate the site further, leading to the revelation of a vast complex of ancient fields, houses, and megalithic tombs that had been concealed beneath the blanket bog for millennia."

      "caption": "The initial research conducted by Seamus Caulfield and other archaeologists dated the C\u00e9ide Fields complex to the Neolithic period, making it a significant Stone Age site. However, there has been some debate among scholars, with alternative research suggesting that the site could date to the later Bronze Age instead. Despite these differing views, the C\u00e9ide Fields remain a site of immense archaeological and historical importance, offering a rare glimpse into early agricultural practices in Ireland. The site's discovery and subsequent research have provided valuable insights into ancient land use and settlement patterns, as well as the environmental conditions that have preserved these features for thousands of years ."

      "caption": "To preserve the C\u00e9ide Fields site and facilitate ongoing research, a straightforward method was employed to explore the sub-bog stone walls. This method involved locating and mapping these ancient walls by probing the ground with long T-shaped iron rods. These rods, traditionally used in the area to search for prehistoric timber beneath the bog, were ideal for the task. The subsequent excavations of habitation sites and tombs uncovered invaluable details about the way of life of the people who lived there around 200 generations ago. These early inhabitants were primarily farmers who cleared vast areas of dense forest to create farmland. Their economy was mainly based on cattle rearing, but there were also skilled craftspeople and builders among them, working with both wood and stone. The cleared woodland, which consisted mainly of pine and birch, was transformed into pasture for livestock. The continuous clearing of forests extended outward from their initial settlements as they sought more firewood and building materials."

      "caption": "Boardwalk at the site. At the time, the climate was warmer than it is today, offering almost year-round growth potential for agriculture. Evidence of this warmer climate was gathered from tree samples found within the bog. However, over time, environmental changes led to the development of raised bogs, which gradually transformed the fertile land into barren, unusable areas. This process was further exacerbated by the formation of an ironpan in the subsoil, which negatively impacted the soil's fertility. Seamus Caulfield estimated that more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) of stone walls remain hidden beneath the bog at the C\u00e9ide Fields site. These discoveries offer a remarkable insight into early agricultural practices and the environmental challenges faced by these ancient communities."

  "description": "This walk visits a fascinating archaeological site on the north County Mayo coast in the west of Ireland. It's a fine place for a walk with interesting ancient history, cliff top trails and wonderful views over the Atlantic Ocean. The site includes the oldest known stone-walled fields in the world, dating back nearly 6,000 years. This ancient landscape is perched on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, where the interplay between the ocean's powerful forces and the rugged cliffs below has shaped the terrain over millennia. From the car parking area you can pick up a circular loop walk around the site before heading north east along the coast for some spectacular cliff top views. To continue your coastal walking in the area head west to pick up the Carrowteige Loop Walk and the Portacloy Loop Cliff Walk. This remote area has a number of excellent waymarked trails with fine views over Broadhaven Bay from the rugged cliff tops.",
