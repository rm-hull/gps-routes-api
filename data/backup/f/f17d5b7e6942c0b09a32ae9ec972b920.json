Fully tarmacked and featuring a gentle downhill slope from north to south, the path is well-suited for wheelchair users, prams, and similar equipment. Along a stretch of approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) near Wetton Mill, the original railway route is shared with motor traffic, as a minor unclassified road has been diverted along its path. This segment includes Swainsley Tunnel. However, the designated Manifold Trail follows the eastern bank of the river for the most part, avoiding the on-road section."

The mill is long since disused, but the Tea Room is popular with tourists.\nThere were ten stations and halts along the line, most with waiting rooms and sidings, although they were small. Today, the sites of these halts are visible, along with evidence of loading platforms, particularly at Ecton, where the dairy industry provided significant business for the railway. Ecton Hill features the remains of a 4,000-year-old copper mine, while the caves at Beeston Tor have revealed Neolithic and Bronze Age artifacts."

Throughout the Manifold Way, the rivers are never far away, with numerous small bridges crossing them. However, during the summer months, the River Manifold disappears down a swallet or sinkhole near Wetton Mill, only to reappear some distance away at Ilam."

Unlike neighbouring walkways and cycle paths like the Tissington Trail and the High Peak Trail, which traverse elevated areas of the Peak District, the Manifold Way follows the valleys and offers more shelter. The route boasts picturesque scenery, and tourism was a key factor in the original construction of the railway. Bikes can be hired at Waterhouses, situated at the southern end of the trail."
