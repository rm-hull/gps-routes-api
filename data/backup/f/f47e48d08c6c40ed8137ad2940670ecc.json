  "description": "These two pretty lochs are located next to Palacerigg Country Park in Cumbernauld. The lakes are the home to Cumbernauld Sailing club where you can try dinghy sailing, paddle boarding and windsurfing. There's also some nice waterside walking trails along the lochs. It's a very peaceful place with lovely views across the still waters to the surrounding hills and countryside. You can also look out for various water loving wildlife on the water.",
