  "description": "This waymarked circular walk explores Grizedale Forest in the Lake District. The trail's name comes from a geological period (about a million years ago) when the forest's characteristic grey slate and shale rocks were formed. On the walk you will climb to a fine viewpoint at Carron Crag, the highest point in the forest. Also look out for a number of interesting sculptures and a variety of wildlife as you make your way along the trail. The trail is also suitable for mountain bikers.",
