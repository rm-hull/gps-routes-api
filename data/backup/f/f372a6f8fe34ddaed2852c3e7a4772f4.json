  "description": "This small reservoir in Barrowford is a nice place for an easy waterside stroll. There's a good footpath running around the lake with fine views of the surrounding countryside. The reservoir is located right next to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal so it's easy to continue your walking along the towpath. If you were to follow the path north you could visit the Foulridge Reservoirs and Slipper Hill Reservoir. You can visit these on the circular Colne Walk which starts from the nearby town. The Barrowford Locks are also located here. It's a scenic section of the canal which includes a car park and good surfaced paths.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you could try our Nelson Walk which visits some of the other picturesque reservoirs in the area. To the west there's an interesting monument and viewpoint in the shape of the 19th century Blacko Tower, located just north of the village of Blacko. The long distance Pendle Way can also be picked up here."
