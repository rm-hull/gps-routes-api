The ramp only gives access to a muddy towpath requiring a walk up to the next bridge to meet the High Street or behind the library. The concrete block under the column on the far bank did not appear on the artist's impression but appears to have been a compromise during construction.\nThe relatively isolated location of the structure will make the bridge prone to vandalism and graffiti. This was already apparent even before its opening."

  "description": "This walk takes you along the Wyrley and Essington Canal from Wolverhampton to the Rushall Canal in Walsall. The flat canalside trail is a great way of visiting some of the parks, nature reserves and historical sites of this area of the West Midlands. The canal is also known as the \"Curly Wyrley\" because of the way it twists and turns through the towns and cities. The walk starts in the centre of Wolverhampton, close to the train station. Follow the trail north east to Wednesfield and Rough Wood Country Park where you can explore the largest oak woodland in Walsall . You then head through Bloxwich, Harden, Pelsall Common , Clayhanger and Aldridge before finishing at the Rushall Canal. Here you could extend the walk by visiting Park Lime Pits which lies just to the west of the canal.",
