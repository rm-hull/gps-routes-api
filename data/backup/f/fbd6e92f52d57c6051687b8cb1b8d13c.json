  "description": "This super country park has cycle trails, walking routes, bridleways, a trim trail and an easier sculpture trail. The park includes the Guisborough Walkway which runs along the former trackbed of the Middlesbrough to Whitby railway line. This includes a wetland area with boardwalks, woodlands and grasslands.  You can also climb Highcliff Nab for fabulous views of Teeside and the coast. Additionally there's three colour code waymarked trails of varying lengths to try. The park is also very popular with mountain bikers with a number of super trails to explore. There is an excellent visitor centre with full details of all the trails in the park. You can find the visitor centre at 8 Old Station Cottages, Pinchinthorpe with a postcode of TS14 8HD for your sat navs. The Cleveland Street Walk and the Cleveland Way walking routes run through or near the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along these trails.",
