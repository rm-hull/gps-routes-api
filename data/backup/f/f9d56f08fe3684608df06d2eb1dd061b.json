  "description": "This large town in Greater Manchester has a number of local parks, several nearby reservoirs and some riverside trails to try. This walk visits Queen's Park in the Gilnow area of the town. There's some nice footpaths here along the River Croal with flowerbeds, and a series of grade II listed statues on the central terrace, including one of former British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. The park is located just to the north-west of Bolton town centre, near to the train station. To continue your walking in the town head north to visit Moss Bank Park and Smithills Country Park. Here you'll find miles of cycling and walking trails surrounding the 14th century Smithhills Hall. On the western edge of the town there's some peaceful woodland trails to be found at Doffcocker Lodge Nature Reserve.",
