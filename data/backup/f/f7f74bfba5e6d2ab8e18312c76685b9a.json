The Wharfinger's (or Canal House) on the right was built in or about 1797 as a house and office for German Wheatcroft, the first Wharfinger (or Basin Manager) at Bugsworth. An adjacent building was built as a stable for his horse. A loaded barge was not allowed out through the Gauging Stop Place outside the office until it had been assessed or 'gauged'. This was necessary to measure the weight and hence the value of the boat's cargo. This in turn determined the tolls paid by the boat on the canal. The displacement of the boat was measured at four known points and an average reading taken. This reading together with details of the cargo, distance to be travelled and the gauge plate number was compared with special tables in the office. A permit was then issued and the boat could leave."

  "description": "This walk takes you along part of the route of the old Peak Forest Tramway which was used to carry limestone to the Peak Forest Canal in the 18th and 19th centuries. The western section of the line is now the route of the Peak Forest Tramway Trail which is open to walkers. The walk starts on Charly Lane near Bridgeholm Green and heads west through Whitehough to Buxworth. Here the trail links with the Peak Forest Canal at the attractive Bugsworth Basin. You can extend your walk by continuing along the towpath or heading up to Eccles Pike for nice views of the area.",
