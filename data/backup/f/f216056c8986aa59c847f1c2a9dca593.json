  "description": "A nice riverside walk along the Medway from Maidstone to Leybourne Lakes Country Park. It's a lovely section of the river, passing a number of interesting villages. The route follows a section of the Medway Valley Walk long distance trail. The walk starts on St Peter's Bridge and heads north to Ringlestone, passing the Gallagher Stadium, home to Maidstone United F.C. The river bends round to the village of Aylesford. Here you cross the river and follow it round to New Hythe and Leybourne Lakes in Snodland. In the park you will find 230 acres of lakes and woodland providing a peaceful location for wildlife and birdwatching. After exploring the park you can catch the train back to Maidstone from New Hythe.",

      "content": "In Aylesford the historic Chequers is a pub of some note. It's the oldest pub in the village, dating all the way back to 1511. It's set in a Grade II listed timber framed, former wool merchants house. The pub is located in a lovely spot with views of the old bridge from the riverside garden area in the back. You can find them on the High Street at postcode ME20 7AY for your sat navs. They are dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you. Next to the lakes in Snodland there's the Freemasons Arms. The pub dates to 1753 and serves good quality dishes. They have an excellent outdoor area with a covered Pergola and patio area which can accommodate seating for over one hundred customers. You can find them at 267 Malling Road, Snodland, ME6 5JR. They have a large car park and are also dog friendly. Snodland is also a nice place for a stroll with its Tudor Mulberry Cottages on the High Street and an ancient church dating to the 12th century. Our walk from the train station in the town visits the Holborough Marshes Nature Reserve where you can look out for a wide variety of wildlife next to the River Medway."
