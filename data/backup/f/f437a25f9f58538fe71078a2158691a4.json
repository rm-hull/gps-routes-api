  "description": "This walk climbs to Stickle Tarn in the Langdales area of the Lake District. It's quite a challenging climb with the trail running along the Stickle Ghyll for a distance of just over 2 miles. The stony path is generally pretty good though with a bit of scrambling towards the top. The walk starts from the Stickle Ghyll car park next to the National Trust's Sticklebarn. From here you head north west along the Stickle Ghyll where there's a series of pretty waterfalls to see. You continue the climb to Tarn crag with the option of crossing the little bridge to the other side of the ghyll if you prefer. The trail then heads around the tarn where there's the option of sitting and relaxing with your feet in the water if the weather is favourable! It's a lovely spot with the peaceful waters of the tarn leading into the start of the waterfall at the top. The crags of Harrison Stickle and Pavey Ark make a splendid backdrop to the tarn.  There's also fine views over Langdale and many of the surrounding mountains to enjoy. See the video below for a great view of the path to the top! After rounding the tarn you descend back to the car park on the same paths. The Cumbria Way long distance footpath, runs past the barn so it's easy to extend your walking in the area on a good waymarked trail. Our Langdale Valley Walk uses the trail to explore the Mickleden Beck to the west. At the tarn itself you have the option of heading a little further to the east and visiting Easedale Tarn . It's another peaceful spot located about 1 mile north east of Stickle Tarn, between Tarn Crag to the north and Blea Rigg to the south.",
