  "description": "This coastal walk visits the town of Skerries in Fingal near the city of Dublin. The circular walk explores the headland, visiting the North and South Beaches, the Martello Tower and the lifeboat station. Near here you can also enjoy a stroll out onto the pier. Along the way there's glorious views up the coast and out to the nearby Colt Island and Rockabill Island. Rockabill has a lighthouse and the largest numbers of breeding roseate terns in Europe. Around the harbour keep your eyes peeled for the Skerries Seals. You can start the walk from the Red Island car park near to the north beach. There's good facilities on the route with benches, ice cream shops, fish and chips shops and cafes for refreshments. To continue your walking in the area head a couple of miles north west to Balbriggan where you can visit the historic Ardgillan Castle. The 18th century country house is surrounded by a splendid 200-acre public park with beautiful gardens, sea views and miles of fine walking trails to try.",
