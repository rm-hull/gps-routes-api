  "description": "Loch Eriboll is located on the north coast of Scotland. It is about 10 miles long and one of the deepest lochs in Scotland. This walk explores the Ard Neakie Lime Kilns on the eastern side of the loch.  A small scale lime industry developed here in the 19th century and this scenic promontory had four large lime kilns developed in around 1870. The loch was nicknamed \"Lock \u2019orrible\" by the British servicemen stationed here during World War II because of the often inclement weather. There are stones arranged by sailors into the names of their warships, including HMS Hood and Amethyst, on the hillside above the hamlet of Laid. To continue your walking in the area head west to visit Smoo Cave . The cave is in a wonderful coastal location and includes a number of walkways you can follow around the imposing cave entrance.",
