  "description": "This large village in Ryedale sits in an appealing location on the edge of the Howardian Hills . It's an idyllic and appealing place with a historic Saxon Church, a picturesque cricket pitch by the 18th century Hovingham Hall, a pretty beck and two fine hotels to relax in after your exercise. This walk from the village explores Hovingham Park before picking up the Ebor Way and the Centenary Way and following them to one of the local highlights at Castle Howard near Welburn . The walk starts in the village centre before heading west to enjoy a circular walk around the adjacent Hovingham Park. You then pick up the Ebor Way and follow the waymarked footpath south towards Hollin Hill. You then follow woodland trails east through Fryton Wood and Slingsby Bank Wood before coming to Kelbro Hill. Here you turn south to enter the village of Coneysthorpe where you'll find the splendid Castle Howard. There's over 1000 acres of parkland and gardens with the splendid Yorkshire Arboretum another highlight.",
