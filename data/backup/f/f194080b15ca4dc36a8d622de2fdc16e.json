  "description": "Explore the 250 acre parkland of this fine Georgian mansion near Leominster . The hall can be reached on foot by following the long distance Herefordshire Trail from the town or you can park in the on site car park. In the 'Capability' Brown designed park there are lovely gardens with fountains, a Ha-ha and a variety of plants and flowers. There's also the pretty Berrington Pool, peaceful woodland trails and nice views of the surrounding farmland and the Welsh mountains. After your stroll you can enjoy refreshments in the National Trust's tea room. You can virtually explore the parkland using the google street view link below! To extend your walking in the area head west and you can visit the heathland of Bircher Common and the interesting Croft Ambrey at Croft Castle . The National Trust owned Iron Age Hill Fort affords wonderful views over the surrounding hills and mountains. Here you can also pick up the long distance Mortimer Trail to visit the splendid Mortimer Forest and the nearby town of Ludlow.",
