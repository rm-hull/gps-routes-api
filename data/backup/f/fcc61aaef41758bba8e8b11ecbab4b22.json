  "description": "This walk visits Berry Pomeroy Castle near Totnes in Devon. It is regarded by many as the most haunted castle in Britain. The ancient site is run by English Heritage and includes the atmospheric ruins of a 15th century castle surrounded by some pleasant woodland walking trails. It's a popular place to visit with a fascinating history and several reported ghostly sightings. There's also views of the Gatcombe Brook, a picturesque pond and some interesting limestone scenery to see. There are good facilities at the site with a cafe, gift shop and car park. The John Musgrave Heritage Trail runs directly past the castle. The waymarked trail runs from Maidencombe to Brixham, visiting several of South Devon's interesting historical sites on the way.",
