  "description": "Eype beach and village sit in a splendid spot on the Jurassic Coast near Bridport . There's some glorious cliff top views and a secluded beach popular with fossil hunters. This circular walk starts from the car park at Eype Mouth. From here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it east to West Bay where you'll find a picturesque harbour and the mouth of the River Brit. At West Bay you pick up a section of the Monarch's Way and head north towards Bridport with views of the River Brit. Just before Bridport you turn west through the fields to Watton before heading south to visit Lower Eype village. From here it is a short walk back to the car park where the walk finishes. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the West Bay to Seatown Walk and head west to visit neighbouring Seatown.",
