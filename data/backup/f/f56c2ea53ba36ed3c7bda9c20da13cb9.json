  "description": "Limpsfield Common and Limpsfield Chart in the Surrey Hills have some nice woodland trails to try. There's hundreds of attractive beech trees and carpets of bluebells in the spring. At the eastern end of the common you will find a lovely community orchard which is a haven for wildlife and wildflowers. It's a nice spot for a picnic with lots of butterflies fluttering around the blossoms in the spring months. The Greensand Way long distance trail runs through the common. You can extend the walk by following the trail west to Tandridge Park or head east to visit the hamlet of Limpsfield Chart and Crockhamill Common. You can also pick up the Vanguard Way in Limpsfield Chart and use it to explore the North Downs . Just to the north west you can also pick up the Woldingham Circular Walk which explores the woods and countryside to the south of the town.",
