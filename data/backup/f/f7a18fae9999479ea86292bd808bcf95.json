  "description": "Enjoy a walk around this pretty reservoir in the Brendon Hills on the edge of the Exmoor National Park. There's lovely grassy footpaths running alongside the water with splendid views of the surrounding hills, countryside and woodland. You can park at the car park at the eastern side of the reservoir near to the dam. Then pick up the trails around the perimeter of the water. It's about a 5 mile (8km) walk around the whole reservoir or you can try a shorter nature trail through Clatworthy Wood. Here you'll find beech, oaks, silver birch and rowan trees and some pretty streams. Look out for red deer, roe deer and badgers in this area and geese, grebes and swans on the water. Just to the south of the reservoir you can pick up the West Deane Way long distance trail near Wiveliscombe. Here you can extend your walk by following the trail south along the River Tone towards Ashbrittle and Tracebridge. A few miles to the west you can enjoy more lakeside cycling and walking trails at the larger Wimbleball Lake. Just to the north you can pick up the Samaritans Way South West and explore the Brendon Hills and Combe Sydenham Country Park .",

The historic country pub dates all the way back to the 17th century. It sits in a lovely spot at the foot of the Brendon Hills and has an attractive interior with cosy fires. There's also a good pub garden and a very good menu. The inn can be found at a postcode of TA4 2UL for your sat navs."
