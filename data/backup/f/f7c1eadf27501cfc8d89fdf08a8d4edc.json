  "description": "A lovely circular walk around Grassington, taking you along the River Wharfe to the village of Hebden before climbing into the countryside above the town. Along the way there's pretty weirs, waterfalls and fabulous views over Wharfdale from the high points. Starting in the town centre you head west to the river where you pick up the Dales Way long distance trail. Follow the trail east past Linton Falls to the stepping stones and suspension bridge where you cross the river. The route then follows the waters of Hebden Beck into the little village of Hebden. It's about the halfway point on the walk, so a nice place to stop for refreshments. After leaving the village you follow High Lane west through some lovely countryside. This section climbs to a height of nearly 800ft so there's great views to enjoy here. If you wish you can head north to Garnshaw House and Edge Top to go even higher. At the end of High Lane you descend back into Grassington where the route finishes. To extend your walking in the area you can try our alternative Walk around Grassington which takes you up to the lovely Grimwith Reservoir. You could also continue south along the Dales Way and visit the wonderful Bolton Abbey where there's some nice trails to follow around the atmospheric ruins of a 12th-century Augustinian monastery.",
