  "description": "This circular walk explores some of the finest coast and countryside of the North York Moors National Park. The route runs for a distance of just under 11 miles, taking you inland through some beautiful moorland scenery before returning along the stunning North Yorkshire coastline. It's an undulating walk with some moderate climbs and fine views from the high points. The walk starts from the Ravenscar Visitor Centre where there's a good sized car park. From here you pick up footpaths heading west onto Stony Marl Moor. You'll pass Cook House, Spring Hill, and Thorny Brow before a woodland section through Allison Head Wood. The next section crosses Mill Beck before passing through Fylingthorpe and reaching the coast at Robin Hood's Bay. The picturesque little village is one of the jewels of the Yorkshire coast with lots of delightful old fishermen's cottages and a lovely beach. The popular tourist village has a number of good pubs and cafes for refreshments before the final leg of the walk. After exploring the village the route picks up a section of the Cleveland Way. The waymarked path heads south to Boggle Hole. The area is named after the local name for a hobgoblin, a mischievous 'little person' thought to dwell in the caves along the coast. Smugglers used the local caves to conceal their contraband including rum and tobacco. The beach is a popular place for fossil hunters so keep your eyes peeled as you make your way through the area. The final section takes you past Stoupe Beck Sands and Peter White Cliff before returning to the car park in Ravenscar. To extend your walking in the area try the longer Whitby to Scarborough Walk which visits Whitby Abbey, Robin Hood's Bay and Scarborough Castle .",
