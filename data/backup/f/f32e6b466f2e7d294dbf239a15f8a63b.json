  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around Belvide Reservoir in South Staffordshire on this easy route. The walk makes use of country lanes, public footpaths and a section of the Shropshire Union Canal to explore the countryside surrounding the reservoir. You can also apply for a permit to visit the area directly next to the reservoir. It's a great place for bird watching with bittern, goldeneye, pochard, shoveller and tufted duck to look out for on the water. Contact permits@westmidlandbirdclub.org.uk to apply for a permit which will also give access to the reserve car park and bird hides. The walk starts from the nearby village of Brewood, located just to the south of the site. From here you can pick up the Shropshire Union Canal and follow it north towards Shutt Green and the reservoir. Other public trails then take you through the countryside to the west of the lake before returning to the canal at Lapley Wood Farm. You can then follow the towpath back into Brewood. To extend your walk you could follow the canal south into Wolverhampton or north towards Gnossal Heath. The long distance Staffordshire Way also passes through the area so this is another good option.",
