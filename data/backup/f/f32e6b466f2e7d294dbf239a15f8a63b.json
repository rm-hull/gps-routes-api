  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around Belvide Reservoir in South Staffordshire on this easy route. The walk makes use of country lanes, public footpaths and a section of the Shropshire Union Canal to explore the countryside surrounding the reservoir. You can also apply for a permit to visit the area directly next to the reservoir. It's a great place for bird watching with bittern, goldeneye, pochard, shoveller and tufted duck to look out for on the water. Contact permits@westmidlandbirdclub.org.uk to apply for a permit which will also give access to the reserve car park and bird hides. The walk starts from the nearby village of Brewood, located just to the south of the site. From here you can pick up the Shropshire Union Canal and follow it north towards Shutt Green and the reservoir. Other public trails then take you through the countryside to the west of the lake before returning to the canal at Lapley Wood Farm. You can then follow the towpath back into Brewood. To extend your walk you could follow the canal south into Wolverhampton or north towards Gnossal Heath. The long distance Staffordshire Way also passes through the area so this is another good option.",

The 19th century pub is located on the outskirts of Brewood village and includes a particularly lovely garden area with a picturesque pond. They also have a good menu and charming interior with wooden floors and roaring fires in winter. You can find them at Kiddemore Green Road with postcode ST19 9BQ for your sat navs. The pub is dog friendly."

      "content": "The circular Brewood Canal Walk visits the reservoir before heading to the nearby Georgian country house of Chillington Hall with its Capability Brown landscaped park and lake. It's a nice way of visiting the reservoir and exploring the surrounding area from the town. The circular Codsall Walk can be picked up just to the south of the reservoir. Near here you can also pick up the Monarch's Way and follow it west towards the splendid Weston Park. There's more than 1000 acres of landscaped parkland surrounding this 17th century country mansion. For more walking ideas in the areas see the Staffordshire Walks page."
