  "description": "A lovely circular walk around the Welsh town of Monmouth, visting Monmouth Castle, The Kymin viewpoint and the River Wye. The walk makes use of the Offa's Dyke Path and the Wye Valley Walk long distance trails to expose you to some of the beautiful surrounding the town. The walk starts from the Grade I listed Monmouth Castle, located on a hill above the River Monnow near the town centre. The castle was established in 1067 immediately after the Norman Conquest, by William fitz Osbern. It was also the birthplace of Henry V in 1386. From the castle you can pick up the waymarked Offa's Dyke Path. It heads east through the town to the Wye Bridge where you cross the Wye River. The path then climbs to The Kymin, where you can enjoy wonderful views down the Wye Valley, up into the Brecon Beacons and across to the Malvern Hills. There's also a number of neo-classical monuments, including the Roundhouse and the Naval Temple, built between 1794 and 1800. After taking in the views the path then descends through the woodland of Harper's Grove to Upper Beaulieu Farm. You continue to Upper and Lower Redbrook in Gloucestershire. Here you join the Wye Valley Walk which leads you along the river back to Monmouth. It's a beautiful section with the river flanked by attractive woodland and countryside. You'll also pass close to the photogenic Monmouth Viaduct on this section. Monmouth is located in the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley so there's lots of options for extending your walking in the area. You could pick up the Wysis Way and head east to Highmeadow Woods and then turn north to visit Symonds Yat Rock .",
