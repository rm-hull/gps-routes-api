  "description": "This walk visits the 16th century Dillington House near Ilminster in Somerset. The walk starts from the village of Whitelackington, just to the east of the hall. From here you can follow a shared cycling and walking trail west to reach the house. The house dates from the 16th century and is notable as the former home of Prime Minister Lord North. At the house you could enjoy a fine Sunday roast or a lovely afternoon tea before enjoying a stroll around the parkland and gardens. There's also some nice trails through the woodland where you can see bluebells in the spring months.",
