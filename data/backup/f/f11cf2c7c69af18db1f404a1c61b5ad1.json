  "description": "Visit this splendid RSPB nature reserve on the Wash on this circular walk near Boston. There are miles of good footpaths taking you to reedbed, saltmarsh, tidal mudflats, freshwater scrapes and grassland.\u00a0There are good facilites with a visitor centre and a number of bird hides where you can look out for a wide variety of coastal birds. These include Avocet,  Hen Harrier and Lapwing. The Macmillan Way long distance footpath runs through the reserve so it's easy to extend your walking in the area. If you head west you can enjoy a waterside walk along the River Welland to Fosdyke Bridge. You could also follow the Macmillan Way from Boston to reach the site. The waterside footpath runs along The Haven river from the town centre to The Wash. If you'd like to visit the reserve by bike then you can follow National Cycle Network route 1 from Boston. It runs on country lanes to Sandholme near the reserve.",
