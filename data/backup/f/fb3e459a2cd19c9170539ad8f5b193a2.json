  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the lovely area of Christmas Common in the Chilterns. The walk starts from the decent sized car park on Hill Road and takes you to Watlington Hill. Here you will find nice woodland paths and an abundance of wildlife. Red Kites are often seen gliding above while the hill is one of the last sanctuaries of the extremely rare silver spotted skipper butterfly. Also look out for rabbits on the attractive chalk grassland and redwings and fieldfares above. The hill commands great views of the Chilterns and the Oxfordshire Plain. This walk makes use of the Swan's Way and the Oxfordshire Way to take you through some of the countryside and woodland surrounding Watlington Hill and the little village of Christmas Common. There is a nice pub in the village where you can enjoy refreshments at the end of the walk. To extend your walking in this area of the Chilterns head south along the Oxfordshire Way from the village. You can then link up with our Turville Circular Walk which visits the Warburg Nature Reserve, the 13th century Stonor Park estate and the famous Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Windmill .",
