This village deserves a return visit on a sunnier day!"

  "description": "This pretty Warwickshire based village is located near Earlswood and Redditch. It's a nice place for a stroll with a picturesque village green, a 14th century church and a 300 year old pub to visit. This circular walk from the village takes you east to Umberslade Hall. The hall dates back to 1695 and includes a large estate with some pleasant public footpaths taking you around Umberslade Park Farm. The family friendly farm includes goats, rabbits, ponies and donkeys. There's also a nice cafe where you can stop for refreshments. To continue your walking in the area head a couple of miles north to Earlswood Lakes. There's some pleasant waterside footpaths and peaceful woodland trails in the adjacent Clowes Wood here. The long distance Midland Link passes through the village - you could follow this north to the lakes.",
