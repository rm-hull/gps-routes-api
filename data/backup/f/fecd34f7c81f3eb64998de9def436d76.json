  "description": "This walk visits the viewpoint at Jeffrey Hill in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire. You can start the walk from the Jeffrey Hill car park. It's a lovely spot surrounded by heather in the warmer months. From here you can pick up a circular footpath heading east towards a cairn circle and Thornley Hall Fell. There's great views over the hills and surrounding countryside for the duration of the walk. The walk can be extended by following a path further east to visit Longridge Fell .",
