These pigs have come into the woodland from the neighbouring heath in search of food and are rooting in the soft soil and eating acorns from the oaks. Each year the pigs (which belong to New Forest commoners) are allowed onto the open Forest for 60 days, known as \"pannage\" season, to eat acorns which would otherwise poison the ponies."

  "description": "This nice, easy walk takes you around the pretty Ober Water in the New Forest. The circular walk starts from the Whitefield Moor car park and follows good tracks through the Aldridge Hill woodland and the Ober Valley. It's a really delightful spot with the tranquil stream surrounded by shady woodland glades.  It's a great place for a picnic and a paddle on a summer's day! Ober Water is located just over a mile west of Brockenhurst . If you'd like to extend your walk then the Blackwater Arboretum Trail is located just over a mile to the north. The village of Burley is also nearby. There's nice trails to try here in the Old and New Inclosures.",
