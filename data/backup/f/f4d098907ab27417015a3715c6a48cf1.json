  "description": "This walk explores the Essex based village of Castle Hedingham and its historic castle grounds. The castle includes the circular Moat Path which will take you around the grounds and the pretty lake, where you can see a splendid miniature replica of Hedingham castle. On the way you will pass the beautiful landscaped gardens and the impressive 12th century Norman Keep which is considered one of the best preserved in the UK. The castle today is family owned but the public can explore the grounds from Easter to October. Look out for snowdrop walks in the winter and the popular jousting events in the summer too. The walk also includes a stroll around the attractive village which includes many interesting old buildings such as the 12th century Norman church and a 15th century pub where you can enjoy some rest and refreshment after your exercise. To extend your walking in the area head south through the River Colne Valley to visit neighbouring Sible Hedingham and nearby Halstead. Here you can enjoy some pleasant riverside trails and a trip to the peaceful Broaks Wood with its wonderful Giant Redwood Grove.",
