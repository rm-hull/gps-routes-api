  "description": "This walk visits a lovely nature reserve and viewpoint in the Surrey Hills AONB. The reserve is run by Surrey Wildlife Trust and includes an old tower, woodland trails, a fine country house, a viewpoint toposcope and lots of interesting flora and fauna. You can start the walk from the car park on Chinthurst Lane just to the north of the hill. It's located less than a mile from Wonersh village and close to Shalford train station if you wish to come by public transport. From the car park it is a short walk south to the hill top where you will find a photogenic, Grade II listed folly. You can follow footpaths around the hill and enjoy some lovely views over the Surrey Hills. There's a handy toposcope at the top which points out all the local landmarks you can see. This includes Guildford Cathedral, Newlands Corner, St Martha's Hill, Holmbury Hill, Puttenham Common and Frensham Ponds. The area is also great for wildlife with birds such as buzzards, sparrowhawks, red kites and wrens to look out for. You can also see a variety of butterflies fluttering around the wildflowers in the summer months. In the spring there are lots of pretty bluebells and wood anenomes to see too.",
