  "description": "This country park is located in Dunfermline and is very popular with water-skiers. However there are also walking trails alongside Town Loch and a cycle trail on the eastern edge of the park. The loch is surrounded by some really pretty countryside and there are also facilities such as a children's play area and a croquet lawn. Just a couple of miles north east of the park there's some more peaceful lochside trails along Loch Fitty .",
