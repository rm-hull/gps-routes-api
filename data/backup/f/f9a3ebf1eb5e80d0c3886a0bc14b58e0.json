  "description": "This traffic free cycling and walking trail links Southwell to Bilsthorpe in the Sherwood Forest area of Nottinghamshire. It's a good one for families as the path is well defined, flat and safe. It runs for just about 7 miles along a disused railway line which was closed in 1968. On the way you'll pass the villages of Farnsfield, Kirklington and Maythorne with views of the River Greet as well. The trail runs next to the Robin Hood Way so you could pick this up and head into Sherwood Forest to extend your outing.",
