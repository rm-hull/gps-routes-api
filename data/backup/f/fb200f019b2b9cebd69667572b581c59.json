  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the village of Succoth, just to the west of Arrochar. There's nice views over Loch Long and the surrounding mountains. You can catch the train to Arrochar from Glasgow on the West Highland Line. The journey is less than 1.5 hours and is also a direct service. The walk starts from Arrochar and Tarbet train station where you can pick up the Three Lochs Way waymarked trail and follow it towards Stronafyne and then on to Succoth. You can then follow a waymarked, circular trail through woodland around the village. You'll enjoy fine views of Glen Loin, Loin Water, Loch Long and Ben Lomond as you make your way along the path. To continue your walking in the area climb to The Cobbler Mountain in the Arrochar Alps. Also known as Ben Arthur, the climb to the summit starts near Succoth and heads in a north westerly direction. The Cowal Way also passes the village. The waymarked trail visits Loch Fyne, the Kyle of Bute and Loch Ruel. You could follow the trail west to visit Lochgoilhead and Loch Goil where you can enjoy some splendid waterfalls on Donich Water.",
