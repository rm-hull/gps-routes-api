  "description": "This walk takes you through the pretty Smardale Gill along the trackbed of a disused railway line. It leads to the magnificent Smardale Viaduct. The viaduct was part of the South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway and has 14 arches, is 90 ft (27 m) high and 550 ft (170 m) long. It's an impressive sight with the structure surrounded by the lovely countryside of the Cumbrian hills and the pretty Smardale Beck which runs through the gill. The area is also a managed nature reserve with wildlflowers, woodland and grassland. Look out for flora such as bluebells, primrose and early purple orchid. Wildlife includes goldfinch, field fare and redwing with lots of butterflies around the wildflowers in the summer months. Red squirrels and roe deer can also be seen in the reserve. To extend your walking in the area you could climb Smardale Fell or Crosby Garrett Fell for wonderful views over the surrounding area. You can also approach the viaduct from the south from the pretty villages of Newbiggin On Lune and Ravenstonedale. In nearby Kirkby Stephen you can enjoy lovely walks along the River Eden.",

A few miles to the west there's the nearby village of Tebay where you will find riverside trails along the River Lune. The village is also known for its 16th century pub and the Tebay Motorway Services. Head west and you could visit the picturesque Sunbiggin Tarn. The area is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which includes some splendid limestone pavement and a variety of interesting plants and flowers.
