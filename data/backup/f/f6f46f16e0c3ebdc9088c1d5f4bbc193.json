  "description": "Enjoy spectacular views of Loch Lomond in this beautiful country park in West Scotland. There are 200 acres to explore with nature trails, guided walks, peaceful woodland, a delightful walled garden and Balloch Castle which now serves as the visitor centre. You can stroll along the shoreline of the loch and then visit the Chinese Garden, Quarry Pond and the Secret Garden before enjoying refreshments at the loch side kiosk. The Three Lochs Way runs past the park so this is a great option if you would like to continue your walk/cycle. You can also pick up the West Lomond Cycle Path at the nearby visitor centre. This will take you along the western side of the loch to the delightful Luss Village. Balloch Castle Country Park is located about 20 miles north of Glasgow, right next to Balloch rail station.",
