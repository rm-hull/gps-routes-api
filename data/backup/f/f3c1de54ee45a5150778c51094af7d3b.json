  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Yes Tor from Meldon Reservoir in the Dartmoor National Park. The route runs for about 5 miles, visiting West Mill Tor and Black Down on Okehampton Common. The tor is Dartmoor's second highest peak, at 619 metres (2,031 ft) above sea level. Start the walk at the car park at Meldon Reservoir and climb south east to Longstone Hill on Okehampton Common. The route then follows paths to the Yes Tor summit where there are a number of cairns and an observation post. There's fine views over the national park from this elevated position. The route then descends east to West Mill Tor and Black Down to the north. The final section takes you back down to the reservoir, passing close to the impressive Meldon Viaduct as you go. The structure was opened in 1874 and carried the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) across the West Okement River. It was constructed from wrought iron and cast iron and is now a Scheduled Monument. To extend your walking in the area you could try our High Willhays Walk which also starts from the reservoir and visits Yes Tor on the way. There's also a nice circular path heading round the lake to try.",

The riverside village is a lovely place for a stroll with paths along the River Taw to try. At Cosdon Hill there's a stone circle and more excellent views to the coast. The Black A Tor Copse Walk also starts from the reservoir car park. It will take you south to visit the noteworthy Black A Tor Copse National Nature Reserve. The wildlife rich reserve is a rare example of high altitude oak woodland and includes some pleasant trails along the West Okemont River.
