  "description": "Follow the Market Weighton Canal from the town of Market Weighton to the Humber Estuary on this waterside walk in the\u00a0East Riding of Yorkshire. Starting in the town centre follow the Weighton Beck south west for about 1.5 miles and you will join with the canal. You then follow canalside footpaths south to the village of Newport where you can stop for refreshments in one of the cafes or pubs. The final section takes you from Newport to the Humber Estuary where there are nice views of Whitton Island and the Lincolnshire countryside on the other side of the River Humber. At the end of the route the canal links with the Trans Pennine Trail . If you wanted to extend the walk you could pick up the trail and head west along the River Ouse toward Goole . Heading east would take you towards Brough along the Humber. To extend your walking from the Market Weighton end you could pick up the Yorkshire Wolds Way and follow it north into the lovely Londesborough Park .",
