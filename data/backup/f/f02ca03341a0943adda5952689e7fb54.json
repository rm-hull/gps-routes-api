  "description": "This circular walk explores the immediate area surrounding the town of Holmfirth in Yorkshire. The town is famous as the main location in the long running sitcom 'Last of the Summer Wine'. Viewers of the show will recognise the pretty streets and the beautiful surrounding countryside from the adventures of the main characters. It's quite a challenging walk as there are some steep climbs but you are rewarded with splendid views over the Holme Valley and Pennine Hills. You can start the walk from the town centre next to Victoria Park where there are car parks nearby. Then follow Cooper Lane and Hill Lane to the village of Upperthong. It's quite a steep climb but there's great views over the Holme Valley to enjoy on the way. Bill Owen, who played Compo in Last of the Summer Wine, is buried at the Upperthong parish church of St. John's. From Upperthong, the route heads through Hogley Green and Upper Stubbin before coming to Hinchcliffe Mill where you cross the River Holme. A nice waterside stroll follows before heading along the woodland trails in Malkinhouse Wood. You then follow country lanes along the Hills and Hamlets trail back into the town. There are many other walks around the Holmfirth area to try with the surrounding countryside criss crossed with various waymarked trails. You could further explore the area on the Holme Valley Circular Walk or the Holme Valley Hills and Hamlets Walk . These long distance trails take you on a tour of the hills, reserrvoirs and villages of the Kirklees and Huddersfield area. If you'd like to go even further afield then the Kirklees Way takes you through the Spen Valley and Colne Valley. Another good option is to head to the nearby Digley Reservoir and follow the waterside path around the lake. The reservoir is located just a few miles to the south west of the town, near Holmbridge.",
