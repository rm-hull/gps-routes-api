  "description": "This circular walk explores Upper Wharfedale and Langstrothdale in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It's a varied and stunning area with glacial valleys, limestone scenery, gills, rivers, waterfalls and woodland to enjoy. It's also great for flora and fauna with numerous wildflowers attracting a wide variety of butterflies during the warmer months. Look out for birds including yellow wagtail in the meadows and kingfishers along the river. The walk starts at Buckden where there is a public car park in the village centre. From here you can pick up the Dales Way and follow the waymarked footpath north west along the River Wharfe. The trail will take you to Hubberholme and Yockenthwaite where you can take a small detour to visit the Yockenthwaite stone circle and cave. From Yockenthwaite you follow trails east to Scar House and Hay Close. This section runs along woodland with a series of waterfalls to see on the way. Near Cray Bridge you turn south and follow Buckden Rake back to Buckden.",
