This Sustrans cycleway, which extends from the canal near Dewsbury to Oakenshaw, with a projected extension through the Transperience site to Bradford, has been a great success. The main reason is that, although it appears semi-rural with plenty of trees around, it passes a great many houses such as the ones on the left. It is also close to the centres of Heckmondwike, Liversedge and Cleckheaton. Like many cycleways, it is on the bed of a disused railway."

This arrangement probably reduced the overall width of the station and thus of the embankment that it is built on. The entrance to the station was up steps between the two bridges. The railway is now the Spen Valley Greenway, National Cycle Route 66. In the foreground is one of the quirky signposts, and against the wall a monster sculpture."

  "description": "This splendid cycling and walking route runs along a disused railway line from Dewsbury to Oakenshaw near Bradford. The path is well surfaced and entirely traffic free. As such it is ideal for families with young children or anyone looking for a nice easy ride or walk. You start off at Dewsbury, close to the train station, and follow the River Calder west to the start of the rail trail at the Ravensthorpe entry point. You then head north west through Iversedge and Cleckheaton, passing a wildlife reserve and a rolling golf course as you go. The trail is also lined with a number of sculptures such as Sally Matthew\u2019s flock of Swaledale Sheep, constructed from recycled industrial scrap. The trail comes to an end around Oakenshaw but you have the option of continuing along the National Cycle Network into Bradford which is only a few miles further north. If you're on foot then you can link up with either the Kirklees Way or the Spen Way Heritage Trail at Oakenshaw.",
