  "description": "This pretty reservoir is located in Dudley on the edge of the Saltwells Nature Reserve. You can follow easy footpaths around the site which is also known as Lodge Farm Reservoir. The Dudley Watersports Centre can be found here too. Look out for water skiing and sailing on the water as you make your way along the paths. You can extend your walk by heading south into the nature reserve where there's some pleasant woodland sculpture trails. The Dudley Canal also runs alongside the reservoir so you could pick this up to continue your walking.",
