There is plenty of interesting history connected with the castle as it overlooked the Battlefield for the Battle of Towton in 1461. The battle took place during the English Wars of the Roses and was \"probably the largest and bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil\". During the persecution of Catholics through the reign of Henry VIII the site also provided refuge for Catholic priests."
