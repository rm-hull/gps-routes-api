  "description": "This Gloucestershire village lies just to the south of Eastleach on the eastern edge of the Cotswolds. The pretty village is located on the\u00a0River Leach and includes a noteworthy 11th century church and a 17th century pub. This walk from the village takes you south through the countryside to visit Lechlade where you can enjoy a riverside  walk along the Thames Path National Trail. To continue your walking in the area head north to visit neighbouring Eastleach. Here you'll find two Norman churches and an ancient stone slab\u00a0clapper footbridge over the river.",
