  "description": "Follow the towpath of the Macclesfield Canal from Marple to Kidsgrove on this waterside walk in Cheshire. Along the way there's lots of interesting lock structures, old bridges, pretty villages, nice pubs and great views of the surrounding Cheshire countryside. The 27 mile canal runs from Marple in Greater Manchester to Kidsgrove in Staffordshire, where it links with the Trent and Mersey Canal. You start of at Marple Canal Locks near to Marple train station. It's a wonderful start to the walk with the fascinating flight of sixteen locks a truly impressive sight. The canal then heads south through the town before branching off to the south west while the adjacent Peak Forest Canal branches off to the south east towards Disley . The canal continues south towards Middlewood and Bollington , before entering Macclesfield itself. After passing through the eastern edge of the town you head out into the countryside again, passing Bosley Locks before coming to Congleton . The Bosley locks are one of the highlights of the route with an impressive flight of twelve canal locks. The final section runs from Congleton to Kidsgrove where the canal links with the Trent and Mersey Canal . The canal is one section of the Cheshire Ring Canal Walk which follows six historic canals through Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Staffordshire. Along the route of the canal there's plenty of opportunities to make short detours and visit some of the area's attractions. For example, around Congleton you can visit the lovely Astbury Mere Country Park and enjoy a waterside walk around the pretty lake. Around Bosley you will find Bosley Reservoir and the climb to Bosley Cloud . Also of interest is the Middlewood Way . The cycling and walking trail runs parallel to the canal from Macclesfield to Marple.",
