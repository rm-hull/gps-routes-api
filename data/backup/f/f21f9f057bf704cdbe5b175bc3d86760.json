  "description": "Shinewater Park is located near Eastbourne. It has two large lakes and well surfaced cycling and walking paths. There's plenty of wildlife to see with moorhen, coot, reed bunting and great crested grebe near the lakes. Other facilities include a skate park, bmx park, cricket court, playground and a Wheelchair-accessible entrance. Hampden Park rail station is a good access point, located less than a mile from the park. Just to the north of the park you can pick up the 1066 Country Walk. This popular long distance trail could be followed east to visit the historic ruins of Pevensey Castle. It's a nice way of extending your outing if you have time.",
