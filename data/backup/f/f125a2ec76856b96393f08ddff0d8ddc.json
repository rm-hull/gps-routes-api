  "description": "Enjoy a stroll along Cemlyn Bay and lagoon on this delightful coastal walk on the Isle of Anglesey. The circular path starts at the car park at the north western corner of the reserve and runs along the coast next to Cemlyn Bay before heading inland and circling the lagoon. You can enjoy a stroll along the shingle beach and around the little rock pools before heading towards the nearby Wilfa Power Station. The countryside around the reserve is also very attractive with wildflowers, orchids and heather to enjoy in the summer months. It's a great place for wildlife spotting with various coastal birds to look out for. These include Ringed Plover, Arctic Terns, Oystercatcher and Shelduck. The colony of Sandwich terns is the third largest in the UK. The Anglesey Coast Path passes the reserve so you could pick this up to extend your walk. You could head east to visit Wylfa Head and Cemaes Bay where there's fine views over to the Isle of Man and the Lake District. The interesting Copper Trail also passes the bay and is another good option. You can virtually explore the area south of the lagoon by clicking on the google street view link below! This shows the good surfaced footpaths that you will find on the site.",

It's dog friendly and there's also a beer garden to sit out and relax in. You can find it on the High St at postcode LL67 0EW for your sat navs. One other idea is to head to the interesting Cemaes Heritage Centre which forms a permanent exhibition, a meeting room and training room. It features a brand new heritage experience, in which one can learn about the bygone era of Cemaes and the parish of Llanbadrig. There's also a a nice tea room where you can enjoy a snack and a rest."

There's much to see here including the fascinating Swtan Heritage Museum where you can journey into the past in a fine old thatched cottage. There's also an excellent cliff top path and a delightful sandy beach with rock pools and rocky outcrops."
