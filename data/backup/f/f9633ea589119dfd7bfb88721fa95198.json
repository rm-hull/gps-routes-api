The Edge is extensively quarried (and was still marked on the 1940s map as \"Cracken Edge Quarry\"). The Naze is the green-grassed, flat-topped plateau on the left of the picture (in SK0483). The prominent diagonal line on the hillside in front of The Naze is an inclined tramway; the winding gear is still present at the top. Combs Moss, Lady Low and Cow Low (SK0678) are visible in the background."

  "description": "Climb Chinley Churn and enjoy super views over the Peak District towards Kinder Scout on this circular walk. The walk starts from Chinley train staion and takes you over Cracken Edge to Chinley Churn. There are lots of interesting geological features and fantastic views across the Peak District. You'll also pass two large railway viaducts and the old slate quarry at Cracken Edge. The walk continues north to Hills Farm where you have the option of heading east along the Pennine Bridleway to the 1,620ft (494m) summit of South Head where there are more fabulous views. You can return to the train station on the same path or an alternative to the west of Chinley Churn.",
