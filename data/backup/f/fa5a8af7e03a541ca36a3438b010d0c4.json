  "description": "This circular walk on Dartmoor, visits the fascinating Bronze Age Settlement of Grimspound. The route runs for just under 4 miles, reaching a height of over 1600ft from the high points. As such, there are wonderful views over the national park for the duration of the walk. Start the walk from the car park at Bennett's Cross, just to the west of the site and near to the village of Postbridge. From here you can pick up the Two Moors Way waymarked footpath and follow it east, passing Birch Tor on the way. The route then passes over Hookney Tor before coming to Grimspound. The site consists of a set of 24 hut circles surrounded by a low stone wall. It was first settled in about 1300 BC. The area is very photogenic with ruined huts and surviving stone entrances, backed by some beautiful Dartmoor scenery. After exploring the site and taking in the views, the route then heads west to Heathland Warren Farm and the Birch Tor & Vitifer Tin Mine. The old mine has an interesting history having been in use between the mid\u201318th century and 1925. You can now see the ruins of the mine with a pretty stream also running through this area. After leaving the mine the route bends round to the north to return you to the car park at Bennett's Cross. To continue your walking in the area you could follow the Two Moors Way north and visit Fernworthy Reservoir . There's a nice waterside path to take you around the reservoir with the option of extending your walk into the adjacent Fernworthy Forest. There's more interesting history here with the Bronze Age Fernworthy Stone Circle to visit too. Heading south from Grimspound will take you across Hameldown Tor to the village of Widecombe in the Moor .",
