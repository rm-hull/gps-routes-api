  "description": "Explore 60 acres of woodland and parkland surrounding this large 19th-century neo-Norman castle near Bangor, Gwynedd. In the grounds you will find peaceful woodland trails, exotic tree and shrub collections, a Victorian walled garden with ornamental ponds and a lovely Rhododendron Walk with rhododendrons and azaleas. The views from the grounds over the coast towards Snowdonia are also magnificent. You can also tour the castle with its beautiful carvings, mock-Norman furniture, collection of paintings and model railway museum. To continue your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Plas Newydd where there are lovely woodland walks and pretty gardens, with views of the Menai Strait and the Menai Bridge. You could also pick up the North Wales Path and follow the waymarked trail east to Abergwyngregyn and the stunning Aber Falls. The falls are one of the walking highlights of the area and well worth a visit.",

      "content": "The popular Lon Las Ogwen cycle route starts just to the east of Bangor at Porth Penrhyn. The off road trail will take you south through Snowdonia to the beautiful Llyn Ogwen, passing the fascinating Penrhyn Quarry at Bethesda and the stunning glacial valley of Nant Ffrancon on the way. It runs mostly along old railway paths and the River Ogwen before finishing at the lake and waterfall. The route is also suitable for walkers."
