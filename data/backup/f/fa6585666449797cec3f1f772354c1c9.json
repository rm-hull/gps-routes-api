  "description": "This Worcestershire village lies on the edge of the Cotswolds and the southern slopes of Bredon Hill . It's a lovely place to start a walk with countryside, orchards and ancient paths surrounding the village. This walk from the village takes you to the nearby John Moore Nature Reserve, the Kemerton Lake Nature Reserve and the neighbouring village of Kinsham. Starting in the village you first head south east to the John Moore Nature Reserve. The reserve was previously an orchard belonging to the well-known countryside author and conservationist, John Moore. There's some nice trails taking you around the attractive woodland and the adjacent mill pond. Look out for wildlife including marsh tits in the reserve. In this area you will also pass the 16th century Kemerton Court, the principal manor house of the village. The route then heads about a mile south west to visit Kemerton Lake Nature Reserve. This section follows pleasant countryside trails across Kemerton Park and Thurston's Wood. The reserve is a wetland complex created out of a former gravel working with lake, pools, seasonal wet scrapes, reed beds, grassland, and land specially cultivated for arable plants. It's surrounded by native woodland and an arboretum. The reserve is great for wildlife with wintering jack snipe, starling and reed bunting in the reed beds to see. Widgeon, teal, pochard and other wildfowl can be seen on the lake.",
