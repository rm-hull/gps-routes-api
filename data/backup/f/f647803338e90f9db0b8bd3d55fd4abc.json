  "description": "This delightful RSPB nature reserve in Tunbridge Wells has a nice nature trail and an all ability path to try. You can pick up the walking trails at the car park at Broadwater Forest Lane. The waymarked trail guides you through the reserve's woodland, wetland and open heath with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. This includes nightjars, dormice and dragonflies around the pond. There's also a section along a boardwalk which takes you through an area of wet woodland. Just to the south of the reserve you will find Eridge Rocks Nature Reserve . It's well worth extending your walk here. You'll find a series of large boulders, woodland trails and a wide variety of interesting plant species. The Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk also passes the southern edge of the site. You can pick this up to explore the countryside surrounding the town. Tunbridge Wells Common is also nearby with its sandstone outcrops, heathland and nice woodland trails. The reserve is located just to the south west of Tunbridge Wells. You can reach it by bike by following National Cycle Route 18 from the town centre.",
