  "description": "Enjoy a lovely walk along the Severn Valley Railway on this riverside trail in Bewdley. The circular walk runs along both sides of the River Severn with views of the heritage steam trains to enjoy on the way. It runs for just under 8 miles though you do have the option of catching the train back from Upper Arley if you wish. Starting on the bridge in Bewdley the walk follows the waymarked Worcestershire Way north to the delightful village of Upper Arley. Here you have the option of catching the wonderful old train back or returning on foot on the opposite side of the river. Here you can enjoy a visit to Trimpley Reservoir. The river and reservoir are great for wildlife watching with kingfishers, grey herons and goosanders to look out for on the water. The path also passes Eymore Wood where there are some nice woodland trails to try if you have time. This route continues south along the river to return to Bewdley. You can extend the walk by visiting the lovely Arley Arboretum in Upper Arley. Here you'll find towering Crimean Pines, a Magnolia Garden and an Italian Garden with water features and a pretty fountain. There's also views of the railway from the site. The Upper Arley Circular Walk visits the arboretum and the lovely Trimpley Reservoir and is a good way of extending the route. If you were to continue north along the railway you could visit the pretty riverside village of Hampton Loade and Severn Valley Country Park. The 126-acre riverside park consists of woodland, meadows, a lake and riverside banks. Here you can pick up our circular Bridgnorth Walk which takes you further along the railway line and includes a visit to Dudmaston Hall, Comer Woods and Chelmarsh Reservoir .",
