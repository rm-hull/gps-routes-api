  "description": "This lovely circular walk takes you around the Saxon Mill fields near Warwick and Leamington Spa. The walk starts at the Saxon Mill pub, a converted old mill with a working water mill. The pub sits on the western side of the River Avon where you can cross to the other side on the footbridge over the rushing weir. You then head east across the fields where footpaths lead along the river towards Milverton. On the way you'll pass the interesting Guy's Cliffe House. The photogenic ruined house dates from 1751 and is a Grade II Listed Building. At the outskirts of Milverton you turn around and follow other paths up toward Old Milverton before returning to the pub. Here you can enjoy refreshments outside on the splendid riverside terrace. To continue your walking in the area, head south into Warwick to pick up the Warwickshire Centenary Way and the Grand Union Canal Walk .",

Near here there's also the historic Stoneleigh Abbey to explore. The 16th century abbey estate includes some beautiful landscaped parkland, lovely gardens and river views. To the west you'll find one of the historic highlights of the area at the National Trust's Baddesley Clinton. There's a splendid moated manor house, bluebells in the adjacent Hay Wood and an expansive estate to see here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
