  "description": "This pretty village is located in the Forest of Dean in West Gloucestershire. Parkend is situated right next to miles of woodland trails and fine local walks including the popular Cannop Ponds and the wildlife rich RSPB Nagshead Nature Reserve. In the village you can also pick up the Dean Forest Railway and enjoy a ride on one of the splendid heritage steams trains. This circular walk from Parkend train station follows a section of the Gloucestershire Way long distance footpath north to the Nagshead Reserve and Cannop Ponds which lie just to the north. You can then follow a shared cyling and walking trail along the Forest of Dean Family Route back to the village. Just east of Cannop Ponds you could take a small detour to visit the splendid New Fancy Viewpoint. Set on the site of the old coal mine the viewpoint is a fine place to watch birds of prey soaring through the skies above. There's also the 'Roll of Honour' sculpture and the Geomap - a map you can walk on showing the underlying geology of the forest. A car park and picnic area add to this pleasant local attraction which is located only a mile or so north east of Parkend.",

There's an attractive interior and a lovely courtyard area outside for warmer days. You can find them just east of the reserve car park at postcode GL15 4JF. There's also The Fountain Inn. The inn was built over 200 years ago and then extended when the Severn and Wye Railway reached the village in 1875. There's some interesting local items on display in this historic pub."
