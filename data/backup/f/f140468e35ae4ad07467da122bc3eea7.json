  "description": "This walk takes you along peaceful Loch Glass in the Scottish Highlands. You can follow a nice footpath along the western side of the loch, starting at the southern end where it meets with the River Glass. You'll pass the distinctive Pink House on the estate before coming to woodland around Culzie Lodge. Along the way there are good views of the nearby Ben Wyvis and the possibility of spotting some Wild Boar as well. You could extend the walk by heading north to visit the lovely Loch Morie .",

It's a nice easy waterside walk with splendid views over the Cromarty Firth at the coastal end. Also nearby is the village of Strathpeffer where you can enjoy a circular walk to the ancient rocks at the Touchstone Maze, the splendid Cat's Back Ridge and the picturesque Loch Ussie.
