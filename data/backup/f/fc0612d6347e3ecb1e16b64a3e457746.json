  "description": "This circular walk from the Yorkshire village of East Marton takes you along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to neighbouring Gargrave before returning to the village along a section of the Pennine Way. The walk starts in the village and follows the towpath north to Newton Locks Bank and Bank Newton. You pass a weir and aqueduct around Priest Holme Bridge before coming to Scarland Lock on the outskirts of Gargrave. Here you can pick up the Pennine Way and follow the waymarked footpath south west past Scaleber Hill, Netcliffe Hill and Williamson Bridge before returning to East Marton.",

Just to south east you'll find the villages of Thornton-in-Craven and Elslack where you can enjoy a peaceful walk around Elslack Reservoir. There's also a fine 17th century pub in Elslack village which is well worth a visit. Just to the north is neighbouring Earby where you can visit the delightful Earby Waterfalls on the Wencliffe Brook. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks page."
