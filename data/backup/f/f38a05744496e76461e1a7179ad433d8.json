  "description": "Enjoy wonderful views over Lake Windermere on this short climb to Gummers How in the Lake District National Park. Gummers How is a fairly small hill at the southern end of Lake Windermere, near to Fell Foot Country Park. It stands at a height of 321 m (1,053 ft) and can be easily climbed from a parking area near Fell Foot Brow or you could go for a longer climb from Fell Foot Country Park itself. It's a lovely footpath with terrific views over Windermere, Lakeside, Newby Bridge and the coast. There's also a number of other trails which you can use to explore the area around the hill. Just to the east you can visit the interesting hamlet of Cartmel Fell where you will find a Grade I listed church dating from 1504. There's also Raven's Barrow where there are fine views from over the Winster valley to enjoy. If you'd like to extend your walk you could pick up the Windermere Way which runs past the hill.",
