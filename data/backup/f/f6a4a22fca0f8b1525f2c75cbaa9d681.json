  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk or cycle around this pretty country park in Wakefield. The park consists of a large lake and pretty pond with several bird hides for you to observe the wildfowl visitors. These includes herons, coots, mallard, pied wagtail, osprey, widgeon and yellow wagtail. The lakeside path is perfect for a nice, easy stroll or ride. If you'd like to continue your activity then the nearby Barnsley Canal leading into Wakefield is a good option. Just south of the park you will find a nice walking trail along Wintersett Reservoir. Nostell Priory with its delightful gardens and 300 acres of parkland is also only a couple of miles away. Anglers Country Park is located just a few miles south east of Wakefield. See the Wakefield Cycle Routes page for more rides around the area.",
