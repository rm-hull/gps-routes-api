  "description": "This lovely circular walk visits the Hetchell Woods Nature Reserve near Leeds in West Yorkshire. It's a delightful spot with peaceful woodland trails, pretty streams and lots of wildlife to look out for. The site also includes the imposing rocky outcrop of Hetchell Crags and the fascinating Roman earthworks at Pompocali. You can start the walk from the little village of Bardsey just to the north west of the woods. Then follow the Bardsey Beck a short distance to the woods. On the southern side of the woods you will find Pompocali where there are extensive earthworks on the course of an old Roman Road. It's an interesting spot, surrounded by some lovely countryside. The site is great for flora and fauna with lots of wildflowers to see in the attractive open grassland areas. There's also Hebridean sheep and a variety of woodland birds to look out for all year round. The Leeds Country Way long distance trail passes through the woods so there is great scope for extending your walking in this lovely area. If you pick up the trail and head west you can visit the splendid Harewood House with its lakes, woodland and attractive parkland. Also to the west is Eccup Reservoir which has a nice walking trail to follow around the water. To the south of here there's also Adel Woods where there's some nice trails along the Adel Beck.",
