  "description": "This is a super walk from Herne Bay to Birchington which includes both coastal and riverside stretches. You start off at the pier in the delightful Herne Bay and follow the coastline to Bishopstone Manor. Here you turn inland through Chislet Marshes towards Upstreet, where you join the River Great Stour for some riverside walking. You continue through Sarre and St Nicholas at Wade, before rejoining the coast path to Birchington, finishing near the train station. This is just one of the Wantsum Walks which pass through the area and can be viewed on OS maps.",
