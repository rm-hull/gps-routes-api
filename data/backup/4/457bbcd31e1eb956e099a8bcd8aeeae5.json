  "description": "This walk climbs to a nice viewpoint at Benson Knott, just to the east of Kendal. It's about a 4 mile walk from the town centre to the Knott which rises to a height of 319m / 1047ft. The walk starts on the eastern side of Kendal next to the train station. From here you can follow footpaths north through Mintsfeet to the River Mint. Follow the riverside path east and it will take you towards Meal Bank. You then cross the Appleby Road to pick up a public footpath leading you up to Hay Fell and Benson Knott. From here you can enjoy fine views to several of the surrounding Lake District Fells. After taking in the views the route then desdends from the fell and returns to the town on the same paths.",
