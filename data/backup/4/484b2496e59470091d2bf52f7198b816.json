  "description": "This circular walk from the Dorset village of Bere Regis visits Bryants Puddle Heath, Bovington Heath and Lawrence of Arabia's cottage near Moreton. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Jubilee Trail and follow the waymarked trail to Shitterton, Turners Puddle and Briantspuddle. The route then heads south through Bryants Puddle Heath and Oakers Wood before crossing the River Frome to visit the pretty village of Moreton. There's some river trails here, a lovely path over the clear waters of the ford, a manor house and the splendid walled gardens to see. After exploring the village you head north east to visit Clouds Hill , the former home of T. E. Lawrence a.k.a Lawrence of Arabia. He first rented the cottage in 1923 while stationed at nearby\u00a0Bovington Camp\u00a0with the\u00a0Tank Corps. Today it is owned by the National Trust who have preserved the cottage as a museum. The route then heads north through Throop to return to Turners Puddle. You then climb north east to Damer Hill and Black Hill before returning to Bere Regis.",
