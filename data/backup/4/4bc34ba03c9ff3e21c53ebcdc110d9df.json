The walk starts at the public car park at Powfoot Scar just west of the village. You can then head east along the beach towards Newbie and Bankirk Point. Here you will come to the mouth of the River Annan just south of Annan. On the way there are excellent views across the Solway Firth to the hills of England. At the eastern end of the walk the route links up with the Annandale Way. This long distance trail can be followed north along the River Annan into Annan town.
