The pit itself is a large depression in the ground, with steep, chalky cliffs rising up on all sides. The bottom of the pit is filled with water, creating a small lake that is home to several species of aquatic plants and animals. The cliffs of the quarry are a popular site for rock climbing and bouldering, with several routes of varying difficulty available for climbers of all skill levels. The surrounding woodland and grassland are home to a variety of wildlife, including deer, foxes, badgers, and numerous bird species, such as kestrels, buzzards, and woodpeckers."

At the summit of Halnaker Hill, visitors can find the remains of a medieval fortification, known as Halnaker Ring. The fortification is believed to date back to the 5th or 6th century and is thought to have been used as a defensive structure during the Anglo-Saxon period."

  "description": "This walk visits an iconic local landmark in the form of the Grade II listed Halnaker Windmill. The route runs for just under 2 miles with a small hill climb on the way. The now disused mill is located a few miles north east of Chichester, near the village of Boxgrove and the Goodwood Estate . You can start the walk from Warehead Farm where there is a small amount of roadside parking. From here follow Mill Lane north east for about 5 minutes before turning north to climb Halnaker Hill. At the top of the 128 metre/420 feet high hill you will find the windmill and some attractive chalk grassland. In the warmer months the area is covered with pretty wildflowers which attract a variety of butterflies including Marbled White, Common Blue, Large Skipper and Red Admiral. There's also fine views over the surrounding countryside from the elevated position of the mill. You can extend the walk by following footpaths north through Halnaker Park to meet with the Monarch's Way . If you follow this west it will take you up to The Trundle where there's an Iron Age Hillfort and magnificent views over Goodwood Racecourse to the coast. Eartham Woods are also easily reached by heading north east from the hill.",
