  "description": "This lovely little nature reserve in Otterford has some nice footpaths taking you along the two lakes and the River Otter. The two lakes which remain are all that are left of a series of pools in the landscaped gardens of Otterhead House which was built in 1845 and demolished in 1952. The site includes woodland trails with snowdrops in the winter and bluebells in the spring. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for kingfisher, dipper and wagtail as you make your way through the reserve.",

They serve particularly delicous pies and a popular Sunday roast. You can find them at postcode \u200bTA3 7RF for your sat navs."

      "content": "Head east from the reserve and you can visit an interesting historical site at Castle Neroche. The area is the site of and Iron Age Hillfort and a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. There's some nice woodland trails and fine views of the Mendips and Quantocks Hills from the high points. The long distance Staple Fitzpaine Herepath also runs through the area. This shared cycling and walking trail is often started from the car park at the castle. The path will take you to Thurlbear Wood where there's some fine ancient woodland, wildflowers and lots of wildlife to see. To the west there's Hemyock which is notable as the largest village in the Blackdown Hills AONB. It also includes an ancient ruined castle and views of the River Culm so is worthy of some investigation. For more walks in the AONB see the Blackdown Hills Walks page."
