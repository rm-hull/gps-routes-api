  "description": "This lovely little nature reserve in Otterford has some nice footpaths taking you along the two lakes and the River Otter. The two lakes which remain are all that are left of a series of pools in the landscaped gardens of Otterhead House which was built in 1845 and demolished in 1952. The site includes woodland trails with snowdrops in the winter and bluebells in the spring. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for kingfisher, dipper and wagtail as you make your way through the reserve.",
