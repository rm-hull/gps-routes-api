  "description": "This Kent based village is located on the easternmost point of the Hoo Peninsula. There's some nice coastal trails along the sea wall to try here. This circular walk takes you south along the coast from the village. There's fine views across the Medway Estuary to Sheerness on the opposite side. To the north you can see the popular tourist town of Southend across the Thames Estaury. The walk starts from the public car park just north of the village at the Grain Coastal Park. The park has a nice beach, free parking and is popular with crab catchers. From the park you can pick up public footpaths heading south towards the power station. You can then pick up alternative inland paths to take you back through the village to the car park. On the way you'll pass the site of Grain Fort, built in the 1860s and used for coastal defence until the 1950s. The fort was almost completely demolished about 1960. You can also enjoy views to Grain Tower which is an offshore wild camping venue at low tide.",
