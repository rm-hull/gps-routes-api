  "description": "This walk visits Brunel Woods in the Watcombe area of Torquay. The woods have some nice peaceful trails which provide a pleasant shelter on windier days. The site is named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the famous English\u00a0civil engineer who built dockyards, Clifton Suspension Bridge and the\u00a0Great Western Railway\u00a0(GWR). Brunel loved the area, purchasing the land for Watcombe Park which was to be his retirement home. Sadly he died in 1859 before its completion. The John Musgrave Heritage Trail runs through the woods. You can follow it to the wood carvings and clearing where there are some fine coastal views to enjoy. On the northern side of the woods there's also Brunel Manor . The manor and its gardens were designed by\u00a0William Burn\u00a0to be the retirement home of\u00a0Brunel. The house is now used as a Christian retreat.",
