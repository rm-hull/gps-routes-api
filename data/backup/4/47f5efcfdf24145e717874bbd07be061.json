  "description": "This attractive Suffolk village is in a fine location for exploring the wonderful Dedham Vale AONB in Constable Country. The village is notable as the birthplace of the famous painter in 1776. It contains Bridge Cottage a 16th-century dwelling used as a location by Constable. There's also a 15th century church and a noteworthy 14th century pub to investigate. This circular walk from the village visits Dedham Mill and Flatford Mill just to the south. The walk starts in the village and heads south and then west to Dedham Bridge on the River Stour. You'll pass Dedham Mill before heading east to Fen Bridge and the picturesque Flatford Mill. The historic site includes a series of nice waterside footpaths which you can follow to Willy Lott's Cottage, the location for 'The Hay Wain', painted by John Constable in 1821. There's also a Grade I listed watermill which dates from the 18th century. After exploring the mill the route then heads north to return to the village.",

You can find them on Heath Road at postcode CO7 6RA."
