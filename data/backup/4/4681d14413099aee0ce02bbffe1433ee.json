It has undergone several modifications over the years but continues to maintain its architectural integrity. The castle's history is rich with notable residents, including Richard Martin, known as \"Humanity Dick\" (1754\u20131834), a key figure in founding the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and a Member of Parliament for County Galway. Another famous owner was the Maharaja Jam Sahib of Nawanagar, also known as 'Ranji', a celebrated cricketer. Ranji purchased the house, its estate, and the surrounding fisheries from the Berridge family in 1924, adding further prestige to the estate."

  "description": "This walk visits the historic Ballynahinch Castle in the Connemara region of County Galway. The castle grounds are a fine place for a walk with beautiful gardens, a picturesque lake, ancient woodland and glorious views of the surrounding Twelve Bens mountain range. You can also enjoy a riverside walk along the Owen Wee River which runs just past the grounds. On the way look out for wildlife such as red deer and pine martins. Atlantic salmon and brown trout can also be spotted jumping along the river. After your stroll you can relax with a drink in the Fisherman's Pub or even an afternoon tea.",
