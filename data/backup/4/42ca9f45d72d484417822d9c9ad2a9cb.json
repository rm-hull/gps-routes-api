Somehow the building seems to blend easily into the landscape and it would be very easily missed while driving. Well worth a walk or at least getting out of the car to admire the architecture and the beautiful Cotswold stone. The manor is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 while the Slaughter family acquired it in the late 12th century. The current building, on the site of an ancient building, was constructed over many years, starting in the Tudor era. Its crypt is estimated to be from the 14th century."

  "description": "This short walk between these two delightful Cotswolds villages is a favourite for visitors to the region. It follows the pretty River Eye from Lower Slaughter to Upper Slaughter. It's a special place with pretty little riverside cottages, stone footbridges, old watermills and picturesque village greens. Don't miss the wonderful 19th-century water mill in Lower Slaughter. It has an excellent museum, craft shop and riverside tea room. This walk follows the Warden's Way between the two villages so you could continue along this path if you would like to extend your walk. The Heart of England Way and the Macmillan Way also run past Lower Slaughter so you could pick up another path and head to the nearby Bourton on the Water. You can also follow the Macmillan Way north east to the town of Stow on the Wold. Our 10 mile Circular Walk from Bourton through Naunton and The Slaughters will take you on a tour of the area using sections of the Windrush Way and Warden's Way long distance trails.",
