  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside and woods to the south of the Oxfordshire village of Piddington. On the way you'll also enjoy a climb to Muswell Hill where you can enjoy fine views over the area. The route runs for just over 4 miles with a moderate climb on the way. The walk starts in the village and heads through Widnell Park before turning south to Piddington Wood and Little Wood. You continue south east to cross the border in to Buckinghamshire, passing Oakcroft Farm before bending round to climb Muswell Hill. The hill stands at a height of just under 200 metres with excellent views over the countryside of the two bordering counties. After taking in the views the route descends north, following a footpath back into Piddington.",

This long distance, waymarked trail could be followed south to visit Brill with its famous windmill. The Brill Windmill Walk will take you to the structure before heading to the nearby Rushbeds Wood Nature Reserve. Following the Bernwood trail north will take you to Marsh Gibbon. Head north west and you will soon come to the market town Bicester where you can explore the countryside on the waymarked Cross Bucks Way. Near the town there are also some nice woodland trails to be found at Stoke Wood. Just to the north of the woods there's the ancient Tusmore Park Estate. The estate dates back to the 14th century and includes woodland, streams and pleasant tree lined avenues. For more walking ideas in the area see the Oxfordshire Walks page."
