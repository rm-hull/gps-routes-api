  "description": "This walk from Freshwater West explores the Pembrokeshire coast around the lovely Freshwater Bay and the village of Angle. The walk starts from the Freshwater West car park near Gupton Burrows. The area is popular with walkers and surfers with a beautiful wide beach, sand dunes and rock pools. The beach also famously used in the Harry Potter films as the location of the death of Dobby of the Elf. You can find Dobby's grave in the sand dunes at the beach. From the car park you can pick up the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and follow it north west along the beach to Broomhill Burrows. You continue past the West and East Pickard Bays to West Angle Bay. You could take a detour east here to visit the village of Angle. You continue along Milford Haven to Angle Bay before turning south to follow inland footpaths back to Freshwater West.",
