  "description": "This circular walk explores the gardens, parkland and countryside surrounding this Elizabethan manor house near Daventry. Stroll through the beautiful 18th-century gardens with topiary and formal bedding before heading into the parkland with its old deer park, woodland and lakes. You can also explore the house with grand rooms, stunning tapestries and Jacobean plasterwork. This walk starts at the parking area at Canons Ashby and then takes you into the lovely Northamptonshire countryside surrounding the estate. You'll visit the pretty medieval village of Moreton Pinkney with its 18th century cottages linked by a communal wisteria. The walk then makes use of the Macmillan Way and quiet country lanes to take you to Crockwell Farm and Woodfordhill before heading through the delightful parkland of Canons Ashby.",
