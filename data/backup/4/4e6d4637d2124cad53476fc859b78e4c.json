  "description": "This walk follows a popular cliff top path in the town of Kilkee in County Clare. The walk runs for just over 6km along a good path with some small climbs along the way. There's wonderful coastal views, interesting rock formations and a variety of sea birds to look out for as you make your way along the path. You can start the walk from the car parking area to the west of the town. From here you can pick up the trail and head west to Knockroe Point and Diamond Rocks. The route then passes along Intrinsic Bay before finishing at Foohagh Point. On the way you you can see the Aran Islands to the North, Kerry to the South and Loop Head to the West. You can extend the walk by heading along the coast to explore Loop Head. Here you can visit the lighthouse and enjoy views of a giant sea stack and the mouth of the River Shannon.",
