  "description": "This delightful little bluebell wood is part of the wider Ashridge Estate in the Chilterns. The wood is very popular in the spring months as it is covered in carpets of bluebells. Please stick to the paths marked by the National Trust when you visit the site. You can park at the car park on Beacon Road which gives access to the wood. Then extend your walk by following the public footpaths running to Ward's Hurst Farm, the Ringshall Coppice and Ivinghoe Common. You can further extend your walk by picking up the long distance Ashridge Boundary Trail and exploring 5,000 acres of woodlands, commons and chalk downland.",
