  "description": "This Lincolnshire based village is located just south of Caistor in the West Lindsey District of the country. The village sits on the Viking Way which can be used to explore the surrounding countryside of the Lincolnshire Wolds AONB. This circular walk from Nettleton takes you up to Nettleton Hill and Nettleton Top where there are some nice views over the area. Part of the route takes you along the Viking Way and the pretty Nettleton Beck which runs just south of the settlement. To continue your walking around Nettleton head west to visit Nettleton Wood. The Woodland Trust owned woods have some nice peaceful trails to try. The Nev Cole Way also starts/finishes in the village. This waymarked long distance trail will take you along the Rivers Trent and Humber to Burton Upon Stather .",
