Part of the route takes you along the Viking Way and the pretty Nettleton Beck which runs just south of the settlement. To continue your walking around Nettleton head west to visit Nettleton Wood. The Woodland Trust owned woods have some nice peaceful trails to try. The Nev Cole Way also starts/finishes in the village.
