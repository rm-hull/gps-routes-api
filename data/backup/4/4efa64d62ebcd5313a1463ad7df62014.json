The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means \"island farm\", referring to an island in the River Thame that flows by the hamlet. The architect of this fine country house was probably George Devey (1820\u00961886), a specialist in lodges, cottages and country mansions, whose distinctive style included the use of tiles and timbering on external walls. A favourite architect of the Rothschilds, he received numerous commissions from family members (as did fellow architect William Huckvale at Tring, another practitioner of tiles and timbering)."
