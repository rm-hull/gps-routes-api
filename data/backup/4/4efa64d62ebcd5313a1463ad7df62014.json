The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means \"island farm\", referring to an island in the River Thame that flows by the hamlet. The architect of this fine country house was probably George Devey (1820\u00961886), a specialist in lodges, cottages and country mansions, whose distinctive style included the use of tiles and timbering on external walls. A favourite architect of the Rothschilds, he received numerous commissions from family members (as did fellow architect William Huckvale at Tring, another practitioner of tiles and timbering)."

  "description": "This route follows public bridleways and quiet country lanes through Middle England, from Bledlow , near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, to Stockport in Greater Manchester. The path links The Ridgeway National Trail with the Trans Pennine Trail passing through the countryside of Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Leicesteshire, Nottinghamshire and the Derbyshire Peak District National Park. Highlights include waterside sections along the Grand Union Canal, the Peak Forest Canal and the River Ouse. There is a splendid wooded section through Salcey Forest near Northampton where you could try the Tree Top Trail. There are also terrific views of the Derbyshire Dales, and a lovely section around Fernilee Reservoir and Errwood Reservoir in the Peak District. The walk is waymarked with a white disc featuring two acorns.",
