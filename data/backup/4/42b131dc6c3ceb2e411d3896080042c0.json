Plymouth City Council built the dam in 1953, incorporating a fish pass to allow migration upriver to spawning grounds. The old pumphouse beside the car park, (which featured as the surgery in the 1990\u0092s BBC TV series \u0093The Vet\u0094), was replaced by a new underground pumphouse in 1981. This is now covered by a Butterfly Meadow, open to the public. The old barn next to the public toilets is now a Camping Barn."

Before the dam was built, the river was navigable further inland. Upriver were Lopwell lime kilns, where lime was burned for use in sweetening the soil. There was also a small quay where flat-bottomed Tamar barges brought \u0091dock dung\u0092 (sweepings from the streets of Plymouth), which was used as a fertiliser, returning with woodland products."

  "description": "Lopwell Dam\u00a0Local Nature Reserve covers an area of 5 hectares on the River Tavy near Plymouth and Tavistock. It consists of a variety of different habitats including mudflats, freshwater marsh, wildflower meadow, scrub-grassland, saltmarsh and semi-natural woodland. It's great for riverside walking and bird watching and includes a\u00a0new\u00a0cafe\u00a0and visitor centre. This walk starts from the car park at Lopwell before following trails along both sides of the river, using the bridge at Lopwell House. The Tamar Valley Discovery Trail passes the reserve so you can pick this up to extend your walk. The trails runs north to Bere Alston and south to Tamerton Foliot. Also nearby is the Tamar Estuary Nature Reserve with lots more wading birds to look out for.",
