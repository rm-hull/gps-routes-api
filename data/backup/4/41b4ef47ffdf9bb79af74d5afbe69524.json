It reads:\n\"Tunstall Reservoir is located within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Beauty and its east shoreline lies within Backstone Bank and Raal Hill Site of Special Scientific interest. This quiet tract of wetland around the head of Tunstall Reservoir has been set aside for nature conservation and most of it can be seen from this viewpoint. The appearance of the wetland, which supports a number of damp-loving plant communities, changes according to season and to the fluctuations in the level of the reservoir.\""

  "description": "Follow the footpath around this pretty reservoir and nature reserve near Wolsingham in Country Durham. It's a lovely place for an easy stroll with species rich woodland on the eastern side of the reservoir and a nature reserve at the northern end. Look out for  a variety of birdlife including Great rested grebe, tufted duck, goosander, moorhen, coot, mallard and common sandpiper. Butterflies are also common in the reserve. Keep your eyes peeled for admiral, small tortoiseshell, peacock and meadow brown. The whole of this circular route is designed for walkers but cyclists can enjoy the lovely country lane on the western side of the reservoir too. The trail runs for about 2 miles so will probably take around an hour to complete. There's a series of benches dotted around the site if you want to take the weight of your feet and enjoy the view. There's a small car parking area on the eastern side of the water on Leazes Lane. You can pick up the footpaths here and there's also a picnic area for some sandwiches after your walk.",
