  "description": "This walk visits the scenic Black Spout Waterfall in Pitlochry in Perthshire. The falls are located just to the east of the town centre near to the Blair Atholl and Edradour Distilleries. There is a public car park here where you can start the walk, following the Edradour Burn north east to the falls. On the way there's some lovely woodland trails and views of the Edradour Distillery towards the end of the walk. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Pitlochry, Killiecrankie and Loch Faskally Walk. The route takes you along rivers and lochs with leaping salmon to look out for on the way.",
