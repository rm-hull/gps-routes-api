In the early 1980s the Leicestershire County, Leicester City and Charnwood Borough Councils joined forces to begin to reclaim the area\u0092s derelict pits for recreation and nature conservation creating this important recreational facility for North East Leicester."

  "description": "This beautiful country park contains over 12 lakes and ponds, wildflower meadows, woodland, grassland and reedbeds set in 350 acres of parkland. Also running through the park are the River Soar and Grand Union Canal. It's a great place for a peaceful waterside cycle ride or walk, located just north of Leicester city centre with National Cycle Network Routes 6 and 48 running through the park. The park also contains the lovely Reedbed Nature Reserve which is a perfect place for bird watching. To continue your exercise you could follow the Grand Union Canal towards Leicester or Loughborough. Our River Soar Walk visits the park by following the river from the lovely Abbey Park, located just to the south of Watermead.",
