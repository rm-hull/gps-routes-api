  "description": "This Suffolk village is a fine place to start a walk. There's miles of trails heading into the surrounding heathland and woodland with the coast not too far away. There's also a pretty village green, a notable 14th century church and a couple of fine old pubs for refreshments afterwards. This circular walk from the village visits Minsmere Nature Reserve , Westleton Heath and Dunwich Heath . The area is great for wildlife with Dartmoor Ponies and red deer to look out for on the way. The walk starts in the village and heads south past Westleton Common towards Hangmans New Wood. You can then follow bridleways heading north east across an area known as the Westleon Walks. This will take you past Saunders Hill to Dunwich Heath where you can pick up a section of the Suffolk Coast Path and head past Greyfriars Wood to the beach at Dunwich. You then head west along Dunwich Forest before exploring Westleton Heath where there's a number of different footpaths and lots of pretty heather in the late summer. You'll pass Broom Hill and Cutten's Hill before returning to the village.",
