  "description": "This walk explores the woodland to the east of the village of Bow Brickhill in the Borough of Milton Keynes. The circular walk starts in the village and follows footpaths east to Brown's Wood and Wavendon Wood. There's miles of peaceful trails with the option of extending the walk into the adjacent Aspley Woods. You can also pick up the Milton Keynes Boundary Walk and use the waymarked long distance trail to further explore the area. Just to the north west you'll find some pleasant waterside walking and cycling trails around Caldecotte Lake. In the village you'll also find a noteworthy 12th century church and a train station on the Marston Vale Line that links Bletchley and Bedford.",
