The canal offers peaceful walking beside its historic locks and bridges, while also reflecting Burnley\u2019s industrial past. The trail also includes visits to historic villages and sites, such as Hurstwood, with its ancient packhorse bridge and Elizabethan houses, and Cliviger Gorge, known for its dramatic rock formations."

Wildlife on the trail is diverse, with upland birds such as curlews, skylarks, and lapwings often sighted on the moors. In more wooded and low-lying areas, roe deer, foxes, and a variety of songbirds, including finches and warblers, can be seen. Along waterways such as the Calder, kingfishers, herons, and even otters may make an appearance."

The walk showcases an array of flora and fauna, particularly on the open moorland and wooded sections. On the moors, heather and bilberry dominate, creating a purple-hued spectacle in late summer, while hardy grasses and mosses thrive in the damp conditions. In woodland areas, bluebells carpet the ground in spring, alongside ferns and wild garlic."
