  "description": "This walk visits the Low Barns Nature Reserve in Witton-le-Wear, County Durham. The reserve is a fine place for a walk with a network of well laid out footpaths to try. There's wetland areas with views of the River Wear, grassland, boardwalks, mixed woodlands and a huge variety of wildlife to look out for on the way. As you make your way around the lakes keep your eyes peeled for dragonflies, bittern and kingfishers. You may also see roe deer, otters and tawny owls if you are lucky. The site has good facilities with a car park, cafe and a visitor centre with lots of useful information and wildlife photography displays. The Weardale Way passes through the village of Witton-le-Wear. You could pick up this long distance trail to continue your riverside walking in the area. If you followed it east it would take you towards Bishop Auckland where you could pick up the popular Brandon - Bishop Auckland Walk. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line between the two settlements.",
