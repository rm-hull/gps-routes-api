There was some uncertainty as to the age of the figure, some thought it dated from the Bronze Age as its stylised shape is similar to those found on coins from the period whilst others thought it was Anglo-Saxon and dated from the time of King Alfred. Research has revealed that the figure dates back some 3,000 years to the late Bronze Age."

  "description": "This short circular walk visits White Horse Hill and the Iron Age hillfort of Uffington Castle near Swindon. The area is historically significant with the 3000 year old prehistoric white horse hill figure and the hillfort located close together. The castle sits at a height of 860 feet (262m) above sea level making it the highest point in Oxfordshire. Also of interest is Dragon Hill, said to be the site where St. George slew the dragon.  It's a very attractive area with chalk downland and lovely views over the Berkshire Downs. There is a White Horse Hill car park which gives direct access to the trail to the White Horse. Follow the trails south east and it will take you up to the hill top where there's grazing sheep, a trig point and wide ranging views across Vale of White Horse. If you would like to extend your walk you can continue west along the Ridgeway to Wayland's Smithy. This fascinating Neolithic long barrow is only about a mile from the hill. You could also head south and visit Ashdown House Estate. The National Trust owned estate has nice woodland walks and attractive grounds. If you are on a bike you can visit White Horse Hill from the Ridgeway which runs past the site.",
