  "description": "This short walk visits the famous Ashness Bridge before climbing to Suprise View for great views over Derwent Water. Both of these locations are popular tourist spots with wonderful views over Borrowdale. Ashness Bridge is an old packhorse bridge which is frequently photgraphed by visitors to the area. The backdrop is stunning with the lake and mountains rising up behind the pretty old bridge and beck. From the bridge it's a short climb to Suprise View, along a nice country lane. From here there's a truly wonderful view over the lake to the surrounding fells. You can park at the Ashness Bridge car park to start your walk. It's just across the road from the bridge, next to Strutta Wood. To extend your walking in the area you can try the short climb up to Walla Crag, just to the north of the bridge. Also very close by are the lovely Lodore Falls. You could also pick up a delightful waterside path heading south along the Watendlath Beck to Watendlath Tarn .",
