  "description": "This attractive Bedfordshire village is situated in a lovely rural spot close to the River Great Ouse. This circular walk explores the countryside and woodland to the south of the village using a mixture of waymarked trails, country lanes and public footpaths. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the Milton Keynes Boundary Walk. Follow the waymarked trail south and it will take you to Mossy Bank Wood, Turvey Hall, Gullet Wood and Gorwelle. Here you turn east to Ramacre Wood before turning north to Horseclose Spinney, Hill Spinney and Abbey Park. You'll then pass Turvey Abbey before returning to the village. The abbey dates from the early 15th century and was formerly a country house. It now belongs to the \"Priory of Our Lady of Peace\", a Benedictine order of nuns. The start/finish point for the walk is very close to Turvey House. The 18th century house is set in 150 acres of surrounding parkland and is open to visitors on certain days of the year.",
