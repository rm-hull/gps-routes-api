  "description": "This circular walk around Eynsford uses the Darent Valley Path and other public footpaths to explore the area to the south of the village. You'll visit Eynsford Castle, Lullingstone Country Park, the River Darent, and Lullingstone Castle. The walk starts at Eynsford Castle which was constructed by William de Eynsford towards the end of the 11th century. The castle is managed by English Heritage and is open to visitors. You can explore the extensive ruins and learn about the castle's history for free before you start the walk. The castle is directly on the Darent Valley Path so you can easily pick up the trail and follow it south west into Lullingstone Country Park. Here you will find 460 acres of parkland and woodland with a large collection of ancient trees including oaks, beeches, hornbeams, ash and sweet chestnut, some of which are around 500 years old. Follow the paths east through Beechen Woods and you will come to the river where you pick up the Darent Valley Path again. It leads you north past the lake to Lullingstone Castle. The 16th century castle includes an impressive gatehouse believed to be one of the first in England made entirely of brick. Shortly after you return to the village where the walk finishes. Here you can enjoy a stroll around the delightful village centre with its pretty little cottages, river views and old church. To extend your walking in the area you could follow the path north to Farningham Woods. The 168 acre nature reserve has some nice woodland trails including a waymarked 1.6 mile nature trail.",
