  "description": "This Lincolnshire Port town has some nice trails to follow through the town and around the docks. The town used to be the home port for the world's largest fishing fleet. This short walk starts from the train station and take you through the town to the National Fishing Heritage Centre at Alexandra Dock. The museum transports you back in time to the 1950\u2019s heyday of this famous port. You can see the old ships and experience what is was like to travel to the arctic on a fishing trip. The museum is one of the highlights of the area and has won several awards. Just to the south of the train station there's the People's Park which has a small lake and gardens. To the south east there's some nice trails through Weelsby Woods .",
