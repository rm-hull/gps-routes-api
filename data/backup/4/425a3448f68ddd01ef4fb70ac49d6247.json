  "description": "Climb to the highest point on the South Downs on this walk near Petersfield. There's a good sized car park off Limekiln Lane just to the west of the hill. From here it is a short climb to the 271 metres (889 ft) high summit of the hill. At the top you can enjoy wonderful views over the South Downs to the Isle of Wight. The area is also a nature reserve with woodland, lowland, chalk grassland habitats. Look out for variety of butterflies including Duke of Burgundy, Chalkhill Blue and Silver-Spotted Skipper. Fans of the comedy Only Fools and Horses may remember a scene with Del Boy reluctantly taking off on a hang glider. This scene was filmed on the western slopes of Butser Hill. The South Downs Way National Trail passes the car park so it's easy to extend your walk. Following it south will take you into Queen Elizabeth Country Park. Here you will find miles of woodland trails and some super mountain bike trails. You can also pick up the Staunton Way and Hangers Way long distance trails in the park.",
