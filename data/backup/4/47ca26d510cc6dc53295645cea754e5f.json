  "description": "This waymarked circular walk takes you through the countryside surrounding the pretty Worcestershire village of Abberley. The varied route runs for about 4 miles and includes woodland trails and a climb to Abberley Hill where you can enjoy splendid views of the surrounding countryside. The walk starts from the village green and then follows path through the village. You continue north east to Netherton House where you pick up the Worcestershire Way. This leads you south east to Shavers End where you climb through woodland toward Abberley Hill. Standing at a height of 283 metres (928 ft) the hills commands fine views over the Abberley and Malvern Hills Geopark. After taking in the views the route descends back down to the village where you can enjoy refreshments at one of the nice pubs or cafes. Part of this route uses a section of the Worcestershire Way long distance footpath. You can pick up the trail and follow it south past Abberley Hall to Woodbury Hill. Soon after you will come to the village of Martley where you can try the Martley Circular Walk .",
