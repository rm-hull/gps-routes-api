  "description": "Enjoy a super cycle or walk along the River North Esk in this country park in Midlothian. You will pass along the Penicuik to Musselburgh cycle/walkway which makes use of disused railway lines. It's ideal for a peaceful off road cycle or walk, taking you through wooded glens with views of the rushing River North Esk as you go. You will also pass a number of interesting historical sites including Rosslyn Chapel, Roslin Castle, Wallace's Cave and Hawthornden Castle. The park is excellent for wildlife with otters, kingfishers and dippers around the river. Look out for buzzards, woodpeckers and badgers in the gorge woodland area. Owls, field voles and butterflies can be seen in the pretty meadows and grasslands. Roslin Glen is located about 7 miles south of Edinburgh city centre, near Pencuik. On the nothern side of the park you can visit Rosslyn Chapel. There's some stunning architecture at the 15th century site which includes some pleasant trails through a wooded glen to the ruins of Roslin Castle. The chapel became famous when it was featured in Dan Brown's the Da Vinci Code.",
