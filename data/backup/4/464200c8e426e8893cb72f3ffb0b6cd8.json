  "description": "Visit the Blue Bell Hill viewpoint on this circular walk on the North Downs Way near Chatham. From the hill there are great views over the  River Medway and North Downs. The south west side of Blue Bell Hill is a Site of Special Scientific Interest with several rare plant species. The hill is also home to Kit's Coty chamber tomb, a Neolithic chambered long barrow which forms part of the Medway megaliths. The megaliths were constructed from local sarsen stone and soil between the 4th and 3rd millennia BCE. Our longer Medway Megaliths Walk visits three of the stones and starts from the same car park. This walk starts from the car park on the hill which gives direct access to the footpaths. These take you across the hill and through woodland, scrub and chalk grassland with great views to enjoy. Flora and fauna is intersting with bulbous buttercup, salad burnet, hairy violet, bee orchid and wild strawberry. Look out for butterflies such as dingy skipper, grizzled skipper and chalk hill blue. It's a lovely place to spend a few hours with a picnic site where you can enjoy a snack and take in the views. The hill is located just south of Chatham, Gillingham and Rochester in Kent.",
