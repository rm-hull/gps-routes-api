  "description": "This beautiful village sits just to the west of Amlwch on the north coast of Anglesey. Bull Bay is notable as the most northerly village in Wales. This circular walk from the village takes you along a section of the Anglesey Coast Path to neighbouring town of Amlwch. It's a splendid section of the coast with fine views from the cliff top paths and some wonderful rock formations to see on the way. From Amlwch you then follow inland roads and footpaths back to the village via Burwen and the golf course. In Amlwch you could stop off to visit the Copper Kingdom visitor centre where you can find out all about the fascinating history of this major copper mining town.",
