  "description": "This walk visits Beeley Wood in the village of Oughtibridge in Sheffield. The walk starts in Oughtibridge which is located to the north of the city in the valley of the River Don. The circular walk starts in the village and heads south to explore the peaceful woods. You can then follow a woodland path along the river to return to the village. Along the way look out for herons on the river and various woodland birds in Beeley Wood. To continue your walking in the area head to Grenoside Woods where there's bluebell woods and some fine mountain bike trails. Wharncliffe Woods can also be found in this area.",

      "content": "After you exercise you can enjoy some refreshments in the Cock Inn. Located at the heart of the village and situated along the Tour de France route, just where it crosses the River Don before the challenging ascent to Grenoside, this pub has been a local fixture for over two centuries. The pub offers a variety of food options, yet it maintains ample space to cater to both diners and those who just want to enjoy a drink. It features a single bar that serves a large main area as well as a separate games room. The main room itself is divided into several distinct sections, including a raised area that can be used for meetings or private events. While live sports are broadcasted, the room is spacious enough to provide a comfortable experience for those who might prefer to steer clear of the screens. The pub enjoys strong support from the village's football teams, both men's and women's, as well as from the cricket teams. Additionally, patrons can explore a diverse Craft Beer Menu, adding to the pub's appeal as a vibrant community hub. You can find them at 5 Bridge Hill with a postcode of S35 0FL."
