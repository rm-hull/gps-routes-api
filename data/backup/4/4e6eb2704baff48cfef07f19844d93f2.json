  "description": "This RSPB Nature Reserve has some splendid coastal scenery and the largest cliff-nesting seabird colony on Orkney Mainland. Walk along the red sandstone cliffs and look out for up to 25,000 breeding seabirds. The walk also visits The Kitchener Memorial which commemorates Lord Kitchener and the crew of HMS Hampshire, which struck a mine and sank nearby on 5 June 1916. Parking is available at route start at the Marwick Bay car park. If you would like to continue your walk then the Brough of Birsay is just a mile or so up the coast from Marwick Head.",
