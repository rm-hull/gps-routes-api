A few miles to the north of the park there's the historic Castle Ashby to visit. Here you'll find a fine manor house surrounded by 35 acres of parkland including Italian Gardens, an Orangery, an Arboretum and a series of pretty ponds. On the eastern side of Milton Keynes there's Newport Pagnell to explore. There's some lovely riverside trails, a fine local park and several historic buildings to see in this nearby town. The town is well known for being the original home of the exclusive sports car manufacturer Aston Martin. There's also a Grade I listed iron bridge dating from the early 19th century to see here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Buckinghamshire Walks page."
