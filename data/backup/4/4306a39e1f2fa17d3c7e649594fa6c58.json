  "description": "This walk follows a section of the lovely Glamorgan Heritage Coast from Dunraven Bay to Nash Point lighthouse and St Donat's Castle. It's a lovely stretch of coast with wonderful cliff top views, interesting limestone rock formations and pretty beaches. The walk starts from the public car park at Dunraven Bay in Southerndown. The ruins of the 12th century Dunraven castle can be explored in this area too. From here you can pick up the coastal path and follow it south to Traeth Mawr Beach and cliffs. You then pass Cwm Nash and Cwm Marcroes before coming to Nash Point. Here you'll find a noteworthy Grade II listed lighthouse, which dates from 1831-32. After passing the lighthouse you come to the medieval St Donat's castle. Wonderfully positioned on cliffs overlooking the Bristol Channel, the site has been occupied since the Iron Age, and was by tradition the home of the Celtic chieftain Caradog. The route finishes at the castle and returns on the same paths, though you could follow an inland path to visit the village of Marcross on the way. Part of the walk follows the long distance Vale of Glamorgan Circular Walk. This epic waymarked route is a great way to further explore this beautiful area. You could continue along the route to visit the nearby town of Llantwit Major for example. If you head in the other direction from the car park you can visit Ogmore by Sea on the Southerndown and Ogmore Coastal Walk. There's nice views of the Ogmore River and the option of continuing to the wonderful Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes .",
