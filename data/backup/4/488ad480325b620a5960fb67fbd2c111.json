  "description": "This beautiful loch in Ayrshire includes a ruined castle, forest trails and stunning scenery. This walk starts at the car park next Loch Doon Castle which dates from the 14th century. It used to reside on an island in the middle of the loch but was moved in the 1930s to its present location, stone by stone. Around here you can pick up the Craiglea Trail which climbs to a nice viewpoint above the loch. This route follows Carrick Forest Drive west to Loch Riecawr. There's woodland trails branching of the drive with lovely views of the waterways running just to the south of the track. You'll pass Whitespout Linn Waterfall and Loch Gower before coming to Loch Riecawr. You could extend the walk by continuing along Balloch Lane to Loch Bradan , Loch Skelloch and the pretty Water of Girvan. Around here there's more great cycling and walking trails through the Galloway Forest Park .",
