  "description": "This walk explores the Tregargus Valley near St Austell in Cornwall. Also known as The Hidden Valley the area is great for walking with woodland trails and a series of old mining buildings to see. You can also enjoy views of the River Fal as you make your way through this historical industrial valley. At the northern end of the route you will pass close to the Goonvean Quarry where there's more old Cornish engine houses in a photogenic old China Clay Works. The walk can be started from the village of St Stephen which lies at the southern end of the valley.",
