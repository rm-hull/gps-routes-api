  "description": "Explore the beautiful Sheffield Park and Gardens on this circular walk near Haywards Heath in Sussex. The gardens were laid out in the 18th century by 'Capability' Brown with four delightful lakes as the centrepiece. There are also a number of peaceful woodland paths and South Park - 265 acres of wide open spaces. The Sussex Ouse Valley Way long distance trail passes the park so you could pick this up to extend your walk. The lovely waterside walk follows the River Ouse from its source near Lower Beeding to the coast at Seaford Bay. Just to the south east of the park you will find Chailey Common where there's nice footpaths, pretty heather and lots of wildlife to look out for. Newick and Fletching Common can also be found in this area.",

The peaceful woods are a great place for wildlife with Crossbill, Nightjar, Hobbies and Buzzards to see. You also could pick up the Uckfield Walk and explore the nearby Ashdown Forest for more woodland trails. For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks and High Weald Walks pages."
