  "description": "The delightful Cotswolds village of Kingham was voted 'England's Favourite Village' in 2006. It's rows of limestone cottages and pretty village greens make it a must see if you are visiting the area. This lovely walk takes you through the Kingham streets before visiting the nearby village of Bledington and Foxholes Nature Reserve . The village is notable for the church of St Andrew which has a 14th-century Gothic west tower with a 15th-century top. It is also accessible from the train station which sits on the Cotswold Line. You can catch direct trains right to the village from London Paddington, Worcester, Reading and Oxford. The walk starts in the centre of the village and heads south west through the countryside to Bedlington. In the village you will find the parish church of St Leonard which dates from 1170. There's also the 16th-century King's Head Inn which overlooks the village green. The inn was awarded Dining Pub of the Year by the Good Pub Guide in 2001. At Bedlington you pick up the Oxfordshire Way long distance trail to take you south to Foxholes Nature Reserve. Here you can enjoy views of the River Evenlode before trying the woodland trails in the reserve. Look out for spring bluebells, foxgloves, woodland birds and over 200 species of fungi. After exploring the reserve you can return to the village the same way or turn it into a longer circular walk by picking up various footpaths through the countryside. The village is located very close to Chipping Norton where you can try our Chipping Norton Circular Walk which visits a number of nearby villages. You could also pick up one of several long distance trails including Oxfordshire Way , the North Cotswold Diamond Way and the Macmillan Way .",
