It is said to have been a favourite view of Queen Isabella, first wife of King Robert the Bruce. In her day, however, there was no loch - Loch Tummel was created by a hydro-electric dam."

However, the view she admired was not this one! The construction of nearby Clunie Dam for HEP generation resulted in the level of the Loch rising considerably in the post Victorian period. The conical mountain in the distance is Schiehallion."

  "description": "Visit Queen's View for one of the best views in Britain on this short walk in Perthshire, Scotland. The viewpoint overlooks the beautiful Loch Tummel with the mountain of Schiehallion making a wonderful backdrop. Queen Victoria made the area famous in 1866 when she visited with her servant John Brown. After strolling along the viewpoint you can extend your walk by exploring the woodland trails in Allean Forest. Here you'll find attractive woodland, sculptures and pretty flowers such as fox gloves and sorrell flowers.  The surrounding Tay Forest Park is huge so there is plenty to explore in the area. As well as the miles of woodland trails the park include several pretty lochs including Loch Bhac and Lochan Nan Nighean. The area also includes a cafe, Forest Park information centre and picnic tables. If you'd like to explore Loch Tummel by bike then you could follow the nice country lane on the southern side of the water.",
