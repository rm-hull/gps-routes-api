  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Wales Coast Path from Pendine to Amroth on the Carmarthenshire coast. The route runs for about 5 miles on an undulating cliff top path. The walk starts from Dolwen Point in the attractive village of Pendine, located on the northern shore of Carmarthen Bay.  The village is home to Pendine Sands, an expansive beach which is famous for attempts on the world land speed record by people such as Sir Malcolm Campbell in Bluebird. From Pendine you head west to Ragwen Point, passing along Marros Sands before climbing to the viewpoint at the 153 metre high Marros Beacon. You continue west past the Top Castle hill fort, Teague's Wood and Telpyn Point before coming to Amroth Castle. You can extend the walk by heading north from the coast to visit Amroth and Colby Woodland Garden. It's a lovely place for a stroll with woodland, widlflower meadows and beautiful gardens to enjoy. There's also the Amroth to Saundersfoot Walk which will take you along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to the popular resort of Saundersfoot .",
