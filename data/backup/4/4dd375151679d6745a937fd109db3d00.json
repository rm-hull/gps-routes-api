  "description": "The East Berkshire town of Ascot is famous for its racecourse and Royal Ascot meeting. There's also some nice walking trails to try in the nearby Bracknell Forest and Windsor Great Park. This walk from the village visits Ascot Heath and the famous Ascot Racecourse before heading to Swinley Forest in Bracknell Forest. The walk starts at Ascot Train Station and follows roads east before linking with a bridleway near Sunninghill. You then head north following roads up to Ascot Heath and the racecourse. The course has close associations with the Royal Family, being founded in 1711 by Queen Anne and located about 6 miles from Windsor Castle. Queen Elizabeth II attends Ascot several times a year. At the course you can follow the Three Castles Path west across the course towards Burleigh. The trail then turns south west to visit the Englemere Pond before taking you to Icehouse Hill in Swinley Park. The pond is a good place for flora and fauna with Little grebe and water rail to look out for on the water.",

If you follow the Three Castles Path south west through the forest you will come to the lovely Tri Lakes Country Park near Crowthorne. There's some nice waterside trails here and in the nearby Sandhurst Memorial Park and Shepherds Meadow Nature Reserve. Near the park there's also the National Trust's Finchampstead Ridges where there are fine woodland and heathland trails to enjoy. Just to the south of the town you can pick up the Bagshot Park Walk. This takes you past the noteworthy royal residence to the pretty Rapley Lake. The Grade II listed house has been country home of Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex since their 1999 wedding.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Berkshire Walks page."
