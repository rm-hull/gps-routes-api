  "description": "The East Berkshire town of Ascot is famous for its racecourse and Royal Ascot meeting. There's also some nice walking trails to try in the nearby Bracknell Forest and Windsor Great Park. This walk from the village visits Ascot Heath and the famous Ascot Racecourse before heading to Swinley Forest in Bracknell Forest . The walk starts at Ascot Train Station and follows roads east before linking with a bridleway near Sunninghill. You then head north following roads up to Ascot Heath and the racecourse. The course has close associations with the Royal Family, being founded in 1711 by Queen Anne and located about 6 miles from Windsor Castle. Queen Elizabeth II attends Ascot several times a year. At the course you can follow the Three Castles Path west across the course towards Burleigh. The trail then turns south west to visit the Englemere Pond before taking you to Icehouse Hill in Swinley Park. The pond is a good place for flora and fauna with Little grebe and water rail to look out for on the water.",
