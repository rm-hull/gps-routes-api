It has been rebuilt since that time and was used by Matthew Boulton for sheet metal rolling during the 18th century. It was also used for grinding tools, making gun barrels and finally as a flour mill. It is Birmingham's last surviving water mill, and flour making demonstrations are still held occasionally. It is open to the public free of charge and deserves a visit if you're ever in the area."

  "description": "This easy cycling and walking route runs along the River Cole through Birmingham. The waterside route follows a nice flat path suitable for both cyclists and walkers. It runs for a distance of about 10 miles, passing through several Birmingham suburbs with parks, lakes and a canal to see on the way. You can start off at Bacon's End, near Meriden Park in Chelmsley Wood. There's a lake here, the Kinghurst Brook and a small car park at an address of Moorend Avenue, Chelmsley Wood with a postcode of B37 5TB for your sat navs. From here follow the trail west through Kingfisher Country Park and the Babb's Mill Nature Reserve. There's some pretty lakes here with lots of wildlife to see as well. The car park here makes for an alternative start point if you prefer. The trail continues west through Colehall and Shard End to Stechford Bridge. Here you turn south through Alum Rock, Bordesley Green and Hay Mills. At this point the route links with the Grand Union Canal Walk which you could follow west into Birmingham or east towards Solihull. This route continues south past Sparkhill and Springfield before finishing at Yardley Wood. The final section passes the noteworthy Sarehole Mill. The 16th century mill is notable as Birmingham's last surviving water mill.",
