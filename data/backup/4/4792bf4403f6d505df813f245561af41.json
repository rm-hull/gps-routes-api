  "description": "This circular walk explores the Dunsford Nature Reserve in the Devon village of Dunsford. The reserve is a particularly popular place in March when it is lit up with the carpets of beautiful yellow Daffodils. In February there's also lots of snowdrops with bluebells the highlight in the spring. The walk starts from the reserve car park at Steps Bridge on the southern side of the river. Cross to the other side and you can follow a path through the woods and along the northern side of the River Teign. There's information boards detailing the wide variety of flora and fauna you can see in the reserve. Around the river paths keep your eyes peeled for kingfishers, goosanders, dippers and otters. You may also spot fallow deer, woodpeckers and tawny owls if you are lucky. Continue north west until you come to Clifford Bridge. Here you can cross to the southern side of the river and follow trails south east through Cow Wood. These will lead you back to the car park. To extend the walk head east to visit Fingle Bridge and Woods. There's more fine trails here with an historic packhorse bridge dating from the 16th century.",
