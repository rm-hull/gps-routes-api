  "description": "This shared cycling and walking path uses the route of the railway originally built to carry iron ore to Consett Steelworks. The path runs from Durham to Consett passing Bearpark, Langley Park and Lanchester. Route highlights include the 13th century Beaurepaire Priory at Bearpark, Lanchester Roman Fort and some lovely views of the River Browney. It's a fairly flat path which runs for about 12 miles. The Brandon - Bishop Auckland Walk and the Deerness Valley Way run close to the trail. They also run along disused railway lines and are a great way to further explore the area.",

These include the Consett and Sunderland Railway Path, the Waskerley Way and the Derwent Valley Walk. On the edge of the town there's also Allensford Country Park to explore. There's nice riverside trails, a decent cafe and a lovely waterfall on the Wharnley Burn in this popular and picturesque park. For more walking ideas in the area see the County Durham Walks page."
