Originally the river flowed through Holme Mills but when the River Ivel Navigation was extended from Biggleswade upstream to Shefford in 1823 a series of locks were built to bypass the various mills. The Navigation was abandoned in 1876 when the competition from the railways made transport by boat uneconomic."
