Originally the river flowed through Holme Mills but when the River Ivel Navigation was extended from Biggleswade upstream to Shefford in 1823 a series of locks were built to bypass the various mills. The Navigation was abandoned in 1876 when the competition from the railways made transport by boat uneconomic."

This walk from the village takes you to the neighbouring town along a section of the Kingfisher Way . It's a pleasant three mile walk, running along the flat riverside path. On the way you will pass the historic Langford Mill and Jordan's Mill, a Victorian flour mill with lovely gardens and tea rooms. See the list below for a number of other walks in and around Langford.",
