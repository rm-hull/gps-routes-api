  "description": "This pretty village is located in the Harrogate district of North Yorkshire. Birstwith is a nice place to start a riverside walk around a lovely part of the Nidderdale AONB. Notable features in the village include an old mill, a weir, a picturesque mill race, an old packhorse bridge and the Station pub for refreshments. This circular walk uses part of the Nidderdale Way to visit neighbouring Hampsthwaite and Clint. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it east to Hampsthwaite. After exploring the village the trail then heads north, crossing the river before coming to Clint. From here you head west, passing the remains of Clint Hall before returning to the village.",
