  "description": "This lovely National Trust owned estate near Porthleven has a number of excellent cycling and walking trails around a large coastal lake. The Loe or Loe Pool is the largest natural freshwater lake in Cornwall. The beautiful lake is separated from the sea by a shingle bar, just east of Porthleven . It is surrounded by attractive farmland, woodland and coast. It's a great place for a safe family cycle with miles of bridleways around the estate. Walkers can also enjoy miles of woodlands and lakeside trails. The route starts from the Penrose Hill National Trust car park just to the east of Porthleven. You then follow woodland trails to the nearby town of Helston , passing the River Cober on the way. Helston has a pretty boating lake and nice tea rooms so is a good place to stop for refreshments. From Helston you turn around and head back towards the lake through the beautiful Loe Valley and Degibna Wood. More woodland and lakeside sections then take you to the shingle beach at Loe Bar and Porthleven Sands where there are lovely coastal views. After passing along the coast you return to the car park on woodland and waterside paths. The walk can easily be extending by heading further up the coast to Gunwalloe where there are more pretty beaches and a valley reedbed which attracts a variety of birdlife.\u00a0 You could also head towards Porthleven and enjoy a stroll around the pretty village and harbour. You can virtually explore the area using the google street view link below!",
