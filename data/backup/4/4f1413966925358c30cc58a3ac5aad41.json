  "description": "This walk visits Sparth Reservoir on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal near Marsden. The picturesque reservoir and the adjacent canal towpath are a nice place for an easy waterside stroll. The lake is also a popular spot for wild swimmers. Right next to to the site you'll also find the Cellars Clough lake which is good for fishing. The canal passes between the two lakes so it is an unusual but also very scenic location. The two lakes help to replace water in the canal lost through the operation of the adjacent locks. You can easily continue your lakeside walking in the area by heading to the nearby Butterley Reservoir and Deer Hill Reservoir .",
