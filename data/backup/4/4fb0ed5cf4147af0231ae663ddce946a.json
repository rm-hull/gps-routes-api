  "description": "This lovely coastal walk in Colwyn Bay takes you to some of the highlights of this lovely area. You'll vist the beautiful Penrhyn Bay, the wonderful headland of Little Orme , and the splendid viewpoint at the Bryn Euryn Nature Reserve. The route runs for about 10 miles with some flat paths and moderate climbs on the way. The walk starts at the train station in Colwyn Bay where you can pick up the North Wales Path nearby. Follow the waymarked trail north west and it will take you past Rhos on Sea to Penrhyn Bay where there are some beautiful beaches. The route then climbs to Little Orme, the little brother of the more famous Great Orme . On the pretty headland you will find limestone grassland and exposed limestone cliffs formed over 320 million years ago.\u00a0It's great for flora and fauna with breeding fulmars and rock-rose orchids to look out for on the way. From the elevated position of the headland there are also fabulous views back down to the coast. After rounding the headland the route then descends back to the coast path and heads back to Rhos on Sea. Here you can follow a road west and visit the delightful Bryn Euryn. There's a short climb to the top of the limestone hill where you'll find a 6th century hillfort and fine views over Colwyn Bay below. The site also includes an historic 15th century house, lots of wildflowers in summer and a variety of butterflies to look out for. After exploring the site the route descends back to Rhos before picking up the coast path and returning to Colwyn Bay.",
