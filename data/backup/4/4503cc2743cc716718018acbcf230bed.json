  "description": "This pretty village is located on the banks of the River Dee right on the England-Wales Border. Historic features in the settlement include the medieval stone bridge and St Chad's church which dates from the 14th century. This route uses sections of The Marches Way and the Bishop Bennet Way to create a circular walk around the village. On the way you'll enjoy fine views of the River Dee and visit the neighbouring settlements of Shocklach and Churton. The walk starts in the village and follows the waymarked Marches Way south along the River Dee, passing the village of Holt and the remains of its historic castle. You continue south, passing Crewe-by-Farndon and Caldecott Green before coming to Shocklach. You could stop off here for refreshment at what is roughly the half way point on the walk. The route then picks up the Bishop Bennet Way and follows it north to Castletown, Wetreins Green and Rowleyhill. The trail will eventually lead you into the village of Churton where you can pick up the Marches Way again, and follow it south back to Farndon.",
