Much of Mannington Hall as it stands today was built in the 15th century; the surrounding park comprises about 20 acres of ground. After having purchased the Hall in the mid-18th century by the 1st Lord Walpole, the gardens were established with battlemented walls and yew hedges."

  "description": "This waymarked circular walk takes you from Holt Country Park to Mannington Hall in Norfolk. The walk runs for just under 16 miles along countryside and woodland trails. It is a reasonably easy walk with small climbs along the way. Start the walk from the car park and visitor centre at Holt Country Park. From here you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it south east along the park's peaceful woodland footpaths. You continue east through the countryside to Hempstead before heading south east towards Plumstead, Barningham Green and Mannington Hall near Itteringham. The historic estate includes parkland, woodland, lakes, a ruined chapel, a moat and some glorious gardens. After exploring the hall's grounds the route then heads back to Holt on alternative paths, creating a long circular loop walk. The return section passes close to Baconsthorpe Castle which is worth a slight detour from the route. Here you can explore the 15th century ruins of a fortified manor house which includes a moat and a pretty lake. You can extend the walk by exploring the 18th century Wolterton Hall Estate which lies just to the east of Mannington Hall at the end of the route. The walking and cycle trails at the popular Blickling Hall are located just south of the trail.",
