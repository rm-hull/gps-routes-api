  "description": "This circular route takes you on a tour of the beautiful Kent coastline around Dover, before heading inland into the countryside. You start at Dover and pass the impressive Dover Castle and the famous white cliffs (explore with google street view below). Dover castle has fabulous exhibitions, winding tunnels to explore and shops and cafes for refreshment. You continue north along the coast passing the Victorian South Foreland Lighthouse, the lovely Pines Gardens and the beautiful St Margaret's Bay at St Margarets-at-cliffe, before arriving at Walmer with its fascinating castle and splendid gardens. The route then passes the pretty town of Deal, which boasts another impressive coastal castle. One of the finest Tudor artillery castles in England, it is another major highlight on the walk. Shortly after Deal, you will turn inland near Sandwich, crossing the famous Royal St Georges Golf Club which has hosted the British Open 13 times. You then pass through the historic town of Sandwich on the River Stour. The walk then meanders through the delightful Kent countryside, passing Northbourne and Whitfield, before returning to Dover. To continue your walking on the trail, try our Dover Cliffs Walk. The circular walk starts from the excellent National Trust Visitor Centre at Langdon Cliffs.",
