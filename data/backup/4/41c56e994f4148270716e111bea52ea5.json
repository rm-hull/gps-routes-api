  "description": "This circular walk explores the Hednesford Hills in the\u00a0Cannock Chase\u00a0district of\u00a0Staffordshire. The area is located just east of the town of Hednesford and includes a local nature reserve criss crossed with miles footpaths and mountain bike trails. There's expansive heathland with lots of wildlife and pretty heather in the late summer. Look out for birds such as\u00a0Yellowhammer, bullfinch, song thrush, and greenfinch\u00a0as you make your way across the site. You can start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the reserve. There's various trails to choose from with one heading around the Hednesford Raceway. The popular raceway is a\u00a0stock car\u00a0track built on the site of a disused\u00a0reservoir, bringing thousands of race fans to the area since the mid-1950s. At the northern end of the reserve there's also the Museum of Cannock Chase where you can learn all about the mining history of the area. You could extend the walk by heading a couple of miles north to visit Cannock Chase Country Park . There's a visitor centre, cafe and some pleasant woodland trails here.",
