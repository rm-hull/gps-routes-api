  "description": "This circular walk explores the Hednesford Hills in the Cannock Chase district of Staffordshire. The area is located just east of the town of Hednesford and includes a local nature reserve criss crossed with miles footpaths and mountain bike trails. There's expansive heathland with lots of wildlife and pretty heather in the late summer. Look out for birds such as Yellowhammer, bullfinch, song thrush, and greenfinch as you make your way across the site. You can start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the reserve. There's various trails to choose from with one heading around the Hednesford Raceway. The popular raceway is a stock car track built on the site of a disused reservoir, bringing thousands of race fans to the area since the mid-1950s. At the northern end of the reserve there's also the Museum of Cannock Chase where you can learn all about the mining history of the area. You could extend the walk by heading a couple of miles north to visit Cannock Chase Country Park. There's a visitor centre, cafe and some pleasant woodland trails here.",
