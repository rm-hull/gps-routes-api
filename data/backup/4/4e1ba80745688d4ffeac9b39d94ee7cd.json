  "description": "This walk climbs to the Black Mountain above the city of Belfast. The National Trust owned area includes a popular summit walking trail taking you around Divis Mountain to the Black Mountain viewpoint. The circular walk runs for just under 5km (3 miles) and includes some fairly challenging climbing. It should take around 1.5 hrs to complete. From the 1,275 ft (389 m) summit viewpoint there are wonderful views over the city to the coast. You can also see Lough Neagh, the Mourne Mountains and Strangford Lough. There's also views of the striking Divis Transmitter Station and the Collin River Valley which runs through the area. You can start and finish the hike from the Divis National Trust visitor centre and car park. In addition to the Summit Trail there is also the Ridge Trail which is slightly longer and includes views over the Antrim Plateau.",
