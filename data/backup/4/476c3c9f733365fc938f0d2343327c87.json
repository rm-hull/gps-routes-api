  "description": "This large area of chalk downland on the South Downs is managed by the National Trust. It's a wonderful place to go for a walk with splendid views over the downs and an abundance of flora and fauna. The area is covered with wild herbs, wild flowers and pyramidal orchids attracting butterflies such as the Duke of Burgundy fritillary and the Grizzled Skipper. This circular walk starts in the National Trust car park and follows the South Downs Way to Beacon Hill - the highest point on Harting Down. The route then heads to Little Round Down where you will follow woodland trails through a large area of Yew woodland. Look out for wren, thrush and finch in this area. The final section climbs Harting Hill through more woodland to return you to the car park. It's a splendid area with fabulous views across the Weald, the North Downs and towards the coast and the Isle of Wight. Look out for Fallow deer, Turtle Dove and Skylark on the downs. The whole of this route is designed for walkers but you can mountain bike across Harting Down on the South Downs Way from the car park to Beacon Hill.",

      "content": "In the village of South Harting you could pay a visit to the National Trust's Uppark. Here you'll find a fine 17th century Georgian House surrounded by lovely gardens with views of the English Channel. The author H.G Wells stayed in the house during the late 19th century. The class divisions he observed here inspired his socialist views which later manifested themselves in work such as 'The Time Machine'. You can find the house at postcode GU31 5QR. A few miles to the west you can visit one of the area's major highlights at Queen Elizabeth Country Park. There's 2000 acres of attractive woodland and parkland with miles of cycling and walking trails to try. The pretty village of Buriton with its 18th century pub is also located near here. Just to the west you can pick up the Clanfield Walk and visit Butser Ancient Farm and Windmill Hill. The farm is one of the area highlights and includes an archaeological open-air museum with reconstructions of Neolithic dwellings, Iron Age roundhouses, a Romano-British villa and an early Saxon house."
