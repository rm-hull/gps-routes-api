  "description": "This pretty East Devon town has some nice easy walks along the River Otter which runs past the settlement. It's also well known for the lovely 14th century St. Mary Church which includes a noteworthy astronomical clock. This circular walk from the town takes you along the River Otter to the nearby village of Tipton St John. The route runs for about 5 miles along public footpaths on both sides of the river. It's a fairly flat path with some small climbs along the way. The town is very pretty with a mill stream, an unusual tumbling weir, picturesque buildings and the 19th century St Saviour's Bridge, spanning the river. The walk starts to the west of the town centre where you can pick up a riverside footpath heading south. It will take you past Salston Barton and Fluxton before arriving at Tipton St John. After exploring the village you pick up a footpath heading north to rejoin with the river. You can then follow a path along the eastern side of the water to return to Ottery St Mary.",
