  "description": "This circular walk takes you past Scaling Dam Nature Reserve and around Scaling Reservoir in the North York Moors National Park. The walk starts at the car park at the western end of the reservoir and passes through woodland and around the nature reserve on footpaths and boardwalks. The path then runs along the reservoir through areas of heather, grassland and gorse. It's an excellent area for wildlife watching. Look out for brown hare, roe deer, stoat, weasel and common shrew. There is also a bird hide where you can look out for teal, wintering coot, pochard and mallard on the water. It's a lovely peaceful place with views over the water to the surrounding North York Moors countryside. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head a few miles south to Danby Beacon where there are wonderful views of the Fryup dales.",
