The town is framed by the surrounding hills of Ben Tianavaig, Suidh Fhinn (also known as Fingal\u2019s Seat), and the smaller Ben Chrachaig. To the east, across the bay, lies the Island of Raasay, with its prominent hill, Dun Caan. Portree was originally established as a fishing village in the early 19th century by Lord MacDonald. The name \"Portree\" is often believed to come from Port Righ, meaning \"King's Port,\" possibly linked to a visit by King James V in 1540. However, the name is thought to derive from the Gaelic \"Port on the Slope,\" reflecting the town's geographical position. The town is considered to be among the \"20 most beautiful villages in the UK and Ireland\" according to Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler and is visited by many tourists each year."
