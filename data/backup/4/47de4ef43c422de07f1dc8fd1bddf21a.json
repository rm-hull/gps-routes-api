  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this delightful RSPB nature reserve in the North Kent Marshes. You can stroll along the numerous pools and enjoy a riverside section along the Thames. It's brilliant for wildlife spotting with huge numbers of wintering waders to look out for. Avocet, Lapwing, Little egret and Turtle Dove are all regular visitors to the site. Cliffe Pools is located close to Rochester and Gravesend. You can park in the little village of Cliffe and walk to the reserve from there quite easily. The Saxon Shore Way long distance walk runs past the site so you could walk from Gravesend along the Thames to the reserve. It is a five mile walk from the town centre. The Hoo Peninsula Path also passes the reserve so this is another great option if you would like to extend your walk. It will take you along the Thames estuary to Gravesend in one direction and Allhallows in the other.",

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "The circular Gravesend Walk visits the reserve from the nearby town. It then returns along the now disused Thames and Medway Canal. The Thames Estuary Path also passes through the reserve. The long distance trail will take you to Foulness Island or the Isle of Sheppey. Just east of Rochester there's the attractive village of Upnor with its English Heritage owned 16th century castle and quaint old village centre. For more walking ideas in the area see the Kent Walks page."
