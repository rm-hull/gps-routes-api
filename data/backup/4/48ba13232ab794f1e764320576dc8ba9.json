One remarkable feature is that despite being only yards from a local 240v power distribution line the church has no electricity and is lit by wick oil lamps and candles."

  "description": "The Isle of Sheppey is located of the north coast of Kent. There's some lovely coastal walking trails here and several nature reserves with an abundance of wildlife to see. This walk explores the southern part of the island visiting Leysdown Coastal Park, Shell Ness, The Swale Nature Reserve and the Isle of Harty. The walk starts from the car park in Leysdown on Sea and heads south to visit the Leysdown Coastal Park. Here there are bracing walks along the coastal wall with splendid views out to sea. The route continues south to the Hamlet of Shellness where there are a number of Coastguard cottages and the Swale Nature Reserve. This remote reserve is an excellent place for birdwatching with Marsh Harrier, Barn Owls, Egrets, Herons and various other waders. You can follow a footpath west along the banks of The Swale, the channel which separates Sheppey from the mainland. To the south there are views over Whitstable Bay to the town of Whitstable on the opposite side. Follow the path west and it will take you to the Isle of Harty Trail where you will pass the noteworthy Harty Church. The Grade II listed church is thought to originate from the 11th century. In the hamlet you can also pay a visit to the 16th century Ferry Inn for some refreshments. It's a lovely place to stop off at what is roughly the half way point on the walk. The route then leaves Harty, heading north past Mocketts Cottages towards Capel Fleet. Footpaths will then take you across Leysdown Marshes before returning to Leysdown village.",
