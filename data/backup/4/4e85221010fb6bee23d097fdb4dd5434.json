  "description": "Climb this hill made famous by Richard Adams' 1972 novel 'Watership Down'. The hill is located about 2 miles south west of the village of Kingsclere. The downs are popular with walkers and cyclists with good footpaths and bridleways crossing the area. This walk starts at the White Hill car park off the B3051 just south of Kingsclere. You then pick up the Wayfarer's Walk long distance footpath to take you to the 237m hill summit. The path passes White Hill and The Warren on the way to Watership Down. It's a beautiful area with wonderful views over the surrounding countryside and the Sydmonton Court estate. The estate consists of a 16th century Tudor manor house and is home to the summer arts Sydmonton Festival. This walk finishes at the Watership Down Hill summit but you could extend the route by heading north along public footpaths to Sydmonton. You could also turn it into a circular walk by heading south from just east of the hill summit and then following country lanes and bridleways back round to the car park. If you continue west along the Wayfarer's Walk then you will pass the wonderful Highclere Castle. The house is famous as the location of period drama 'Downton Abbey'. It is surrounded by a 5000 acre estate with nice walking trails including a climb to the splendid viewpoint at Beacon Hill. Less than a mile away to the west is Ladle Hill where you will find a well preserved hill fort.",

The route visits the Hannington TV transmitter and Freemantle Park Down to the east of the Down. The village is also worth exploring with many historic buildings including a Norman church.
