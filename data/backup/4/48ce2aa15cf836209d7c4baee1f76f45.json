You can also visit the lovely Backwell Lake Nature Reserve at the southern edge of the town. For cyclists, National Cycle Route 33 passes close to the house if you wish to visit by bike. The National Trust village of Failand is just to the east of the estate. There's a nice circular walk to try here taking you to the local bluebell woods and the delightful Abbots Pool.
