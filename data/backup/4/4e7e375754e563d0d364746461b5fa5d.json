The garden is the only surviving garden of the rococo period which is open to the public. It was designed and laid out in the 1740s. The garden has been restored since 1984 having been abandoned in the 1950s. It includes woodland, flower and vegetable plots, garden buildings, charming follies and a maze. Several snowdrops, particularly Galanthus 'Atkinsii' are found in the grounds. There are a series of ponds and streams on the slopes of the valley with small waterfalls."

  "description": "Visit the delightful Cotswolds village of Painswick and climb the nearby Painswick Hill on this walk near Stroud. The walk starts from Painswick known as the 'Queen of the Cotswolds' because of its picturesque cottages, pretty churchyard with yew trees and the splendid Rococo Gardens. You can then follow the Cotswold Way National Trail north to the beacon. The trail is well signposted and takes you through the local golf course and past the aptly named Paradise valley. You soon come to the beacon where you will find an Iron Age Hill Fort and fabulous views over the Severn Vale, the Forest of Dean and the Welsh Mountains. From the top of the hill you can descend back to the village or if you'd like to extend your walk, you could continue along the Cotswold Way to the nearby Pope's Wood and Kites Hill. A little further on is Coopers Hill where the annual Cheese Rolling event is held on the Spring Bank Holiday. It involves  locals chasing a large round cheese down a near-vertical grass slope. If you enjoy this walk you could head a couple of miles south west and visit Haresfield Beacon for more great walking trails and panoramic views of the Cotswolds. You could also follow the Wysis Way long distance trail south and visit the beautiful Slad Valley. The area is famous for its associations with the author Laurie Lee, who based his book 'Cider with Rosie' on his own life in the village.",
