  "description": "This popular hike visits a spectacular sandstone arch in the Sedona part of the Coconino National Forest in Arizona. It's a great hike with some stunning scenery and fascinating geology. You can start the hike from the Dry Creek Road parking area at the trail head. Then follow the marker signs up to the arch. It's a steady climb with some steps towards the end. From the high points there are wonderful views over the surrounding area.
