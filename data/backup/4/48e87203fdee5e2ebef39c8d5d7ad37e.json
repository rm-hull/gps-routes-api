  "description": "This challenging circular walk explores the hills and countryside surrounding the Derbyshire village of Castleton. You'll climb to the popular hills of Mam Tor, Hollins Cross and Lose Hill with spectacular views over the surrounding Peak District countryside. It's about a six mile walk with the route climbing to a height of over 1600ft at the high points. You start from the popular village of Castleton in the Hope Valley. It's a great base for walkers wishing to explore this fantastic area of the Peak District. The route heads west out of the village across Winnats Pass with its towering limestone pinnacles and series of show caves. The route then climbs to the 517 m (1,696 ft) summit of Mam Tor. The hill is geologically fascinating with 320 million year old Carboniferous rocks. From the summit there are fine views towards Manchester city centre, Stockport, Winter Hill and the Edale Valley. From Mam Tor the route descends to the smaller Hollins Cross hill before climbing to Back Tor and Lose Hill. From the 476 m (1,562 ft) Lose Hill summit you then descend back to Castleton on a series of footpaths and country lanes. To extend your walk you can head north west from Hollins Cross to Edale where you can climb the fabulous Kinder Scout. Just follow our Edale to Castleton Walk to reach Edale via Hollins Cross.",
