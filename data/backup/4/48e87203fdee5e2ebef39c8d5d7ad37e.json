  "description": "This challenging circular walk explores the hills and countryside surrounding the Derbyshire village of Castleton. You'll climb to the popular hills of Mam Tor, Hollins Cross and Lose Hill with spectacular views over the surrounding Peak District countryside. It's about a six mile walk with the route climbing to a height of over 1600ft at the high points. You start from the popular village of Castleton in the Hope Valley. It's a great base for walkers wishing to explore this fantastic area of the Peak District. The route heads west out of the village across Winnats Pass with its towering limestone pinnacles and series of show caves. The route then climbs to the 517 m (1,696 ft) summit of Mam Tor. The hill is geologically fascinating with 320 million year old Carboniferous rocks. From the summit there are fine views towards Manchester city centre, Stockport, Winter Hill and the Edale Valley. From Mam Tor the route descends to the smaller Hollins Cross hill before climbing to Back Tor and Lose Hill. From the 476 m (1,562 ft) Lose Hill summit you then descend back to Castleton on a series of footpaths and country lanes. To extend your walk you can head north west from Hollins Cross to Edale where you can climb the fabulous Kinder Scout. Just follow our Edale to Castleton Walk to reach Edale via Hollins Cross.",

The Peak District Pub Walk - The Inn Way passes through the village. The circular route takes you to over 50 pubs in the National Park.

      "content": "For a shorter route please see the Mam Tor Walk from Castleton. This circular route runs for about 5 miles and descends back to the village from Hollins Cross. You could also descend south west past Mam Farm to Little Mam Tor which is very pretty. This path runs past the Treak Cliff Cavern and Goosehill before coming into the village. There's lots of other great places to visit around Castleton if you have time. A visit to Peveril Castle is certainly worthwhile. The ruined medieval castle has an amazing history stretching back to the Norman Conquest of 1066.Also popular are the natural caves tours at Peak Cavern and the underground boat trip at Speedwell Cavern. Just to the south east you can pick up the circular Bradwell Walk. This visits the pretty village before heading to the ancient Roman Fort at Brough and climbing Bradwell Edge. There's also a fine 16th century pub in the area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
