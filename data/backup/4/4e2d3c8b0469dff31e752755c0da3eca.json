  "description": "This Lake District village is a nice place to start a walk with several nearby lakeland highlights and a nice old pub to relax in afterwards. The little village includes a 19th century church, a decent old pub and a number of stone cottages built from the surrounding slate quarries which are a prominent feature of this area. This walk from the village takes you east along a section of the Cumbria Way to neighbouring Elterwater . On the way you'll pass along the Great Langdale Beck and visit the Elterwater Slate Quarry. You finish at Elter Water Lake where there a fine views across the still waters to the surrounding mountains. You could extend the walk by heading up to the nearby Loughrigg Tarn .",
