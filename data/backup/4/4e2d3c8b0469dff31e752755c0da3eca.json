  "description": "This Lake District village is a nice place to start a walk with several nearby lakeland highlights and a nice old pub to relax in afterwards. The little village includes a 19th century church, a decent old pub and a number of stone cottages built from the surrounding slate quarries which are a prominent feature of this area. This walk from the village takes you east along a section of the Cumbria Way to neighbouring Elterwater. On the way you'll pass along the Great Langdale Beck and visit the Elterwater Slate Quarry. You finish at Elter Water Lake where there a fine views across the still waters to the surrounding mountains. You could extend the walk by heading up to the nearby Loughrigg Tarn .",
