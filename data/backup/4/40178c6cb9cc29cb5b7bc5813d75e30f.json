  "description": "This Derbyshire based village is located on the edge of the\u00a0Peak District National Park, on the western side of Dronfield and the southern side of Sheffield. It's an historic place with 43 buildings listed as historically or architecturally significant.\u00a0These date mainly from the 15th to the 17th century and include Cartledge Hall and Holmesfield Hall. This walk from the village takes you north to explore Holmesfield Park Wood. There's some nice peaceful woodland trails and an Easy Access Trail in the woods. The Dronfield 2000 Rotary Walk can be picked up to the west of the village and followed to the nearby woods. The 12 mile, waymarked circular walk can be used to extend your outing if you have time. In the woods you can look out for a variety of wildlife including deer and woodpeckers. At the northern end of the woods you can also follow footpaths past Woodthorpe Hall. The 17th century private house is used for weddings but you can enjoy views of the historic site from near the northern edge of the woods.",
