  "description": "This circular walk takes you along a nice section of the River Duddon in the Lake District National Park. You'll also visit Dunnderdale Forest and enjoy fine views of the surrounding fells. The route runs for just under 4 miles on a mixture of country lanes and footpaths. On the way there's also a small climb. Start the walk from the public car park on the eastern side of Dunnerdale Forest, next to the river. From here you can pick up riverside trails along both sides of the water, crossing the river at Cockley Beck. This is a nice spot with an old stone bridge over the water. You'll also pass the picturesque stepping stones near Dale Head on this first section. On the western side of the river you'll follow an Old Roman Road, passing Castle How before returning to the car park. There's lots of other good walks to try in the Duddon Valley. You could head east and enjoy a climb to Dow Crag and Seathwaite Tarn . Head west across the Hardknott Pass and you could visit the old Roman Fort at Hardknott Castle and climb to Harter Fell . Our climb to the fell starts from the same car park.",
