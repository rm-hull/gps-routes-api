  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk through the woodland and heathland of Puttenham Common in the North Downs, near Guildford . There are several large ponds and wetland areas that attract a wide variety of wildlife including great crested grebes and grey herons. Look out for roe deer and green woodpecker in the woodland areas. There are also some good bridleways which are suitable for cyclists with mountain bikes. This walk just takes you around Puttenham Common but you could easily extend your walk by heading west to the nearby Crooksbury Common where you can climb Crooksbury Hill for super views of the area. You could also pick up the Fox Way or North Downs Way which run past the common. Puttenham Common lies a few miles west of Guildford. You could follow the North Downs Way from Guildford straight to the common. It will take you through some nice woodland and past Compton, Littleton and Loseley Park .",
