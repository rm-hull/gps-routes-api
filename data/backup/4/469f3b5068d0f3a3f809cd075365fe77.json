  "description": "This Northumberland based village is located close to the larger settlements of Morpeth and Cramlington. This walk from the village follows footpaths east to visit one of the walking highlights of the area at Plessey Woods Country Park. The park has miles of peaceful woodland trails and pleasant waterside footpaths along the River Blyth. You could extend the walk by continuing east to visit Bedlington Country Park. If you head south you could visit Northumberlandia. Here you'll find a huge land sculpture with some splendid views over the area.",
