  "description": "This walk takes you along Loch Arkaig and the adjacent pine forest in Lochaber. You can start the walk from the car park at Eas Chia-aig falls at the eastern end of the loch. Then head west across the River Arkaig and into the attractive woodland. It's a good track which leads to the Inver mallie bothy where there are great views across the loch. It's a very peaceful area with splendid views of the surrounding mountains and the possibility of spotting ospreys in the skies above. You can continue your walking by heading to the nearby Loch Lochy where you can follow the waterside cycling and walking trail along the Great Glen Way. It's a great route and includes more nice woodland trails through the Clunes Forest.",

Loch Rannoch with its expansive forest is also located in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
