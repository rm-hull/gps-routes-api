    "description": "This circular walk explores a lovely little nature reserve in Whitworth. At the site you can explore lots of nice footpaths through a densley wooded valley. There's the rushing water of the River Spodden with pretty waterfalls and lots of wildlife to look out for. The site also includes water mills, picnic areas and the impressive 1867 Healey Dell Viaduct. The reserve has good facilities with a visitor centre providing lots of helpful information and a nice cafe. The reserve is in a great location for extending your walking in the area as there are number of waymarked footpaths to pick up. If you head west you can climb to Hunger Hill and Forsyth Brow before coming to Greenbooth Reservoir. The Rochdale Way and Pennine Bridleway pass the reserve so you can follow these paths across the surrounding Pennine Moors.",

The Hail Storm Hill and Scout Moor Wind Farm Walk starts off from the reserve. The area is notable as the highest point of the Rossendale Valley and the location of the second largest onshore wind farm in England. Just to the west of the hill you could also visit Waugh's Well. The structure was created to commemorate local poet Edwin Waugh who is known locally as \"the Lancashire Burns\". There is also a small reservoir and more excellent views from this interesting spot. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
