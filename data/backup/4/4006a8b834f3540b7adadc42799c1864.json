  "description": "This walk takes you along the Exe Estuary from Topsham to Exmouth via Lympstone. The route runs for about 5 miles along a section of the Exe Estuary Trail . It's a nice flat path running along the train line, with lovely views over the saltmarsh and mud flats of the estuary. The area is also a nature reserve so great for wildlife spotting as over 10,000 wildfowl and 20,000 waders winter on the estuary. Look out for dark-bellied brant goose, pied avocet, lapwings, redshanks and Cetti's warblers as you make your way along the path. The route starts in Topsham, next to the ferry, which transport passengers over the estuary to Exminster on the other side. You start by passing along the Exe Reedbeds Nature Reserve, heading south towards Exton, via Nutwell Park and the\u00a0Georgian neo-classical\u00a0Grade II listed mansion house\u00a0of Nutwell Court. You continue to Lympstone where there is an attractive harbour and the 19th century Italianate riverfront brick clock tower known as Peter's Tower. The final stage runs from Lympstone to Exmouth, finishing at the train station where you can catch the train back to Topsham. Back in the village you can continue your exercise by trying the Topsham Goat Walk which takes you to the lovely Bowling Green Marsh. You can extend your walk by exploring the western end of the Jurassic Coast which starts at the nearby Orcombe Point . This walk will take you past the Maer Rocks and Maer Local Nature Reserve before visiting the impressive Geoneedle sculpture at Orcombe Point.",
