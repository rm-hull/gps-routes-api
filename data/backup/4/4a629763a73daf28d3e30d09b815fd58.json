  "description": "Explore miles of walking and cycling trails in these extensive woods in Arlington, Sussex. There's nice waymarked footpaths and bridleways which are great for mountain biking. You can reach the woods from Hailsham by heading south along the Cuckoo Trail and then heading west along National Cycle Route 2 from Polegate. There are two trails to try on the site. Abbots Amble will take you through bluebell woods to the lake. The Oak walk will take you through the collection of Oaks with bluebells and woodland birds to look out for. Both are easy paths ideal for a peaceful afternoon stroll. To extend your walking in the area you can head about a mile to the west and visit Arlington Reservoir . There's a nice walking trail around the water with lots of birdlife to look out for. The Wealdway passes through Arlington so you could pick this up and head towards Hailsham or Wilmington. Also nearby is Michelham Priory in Upper Dicker. It's just to the north of the woods and is well worth a visit. The Augustine Priory dates from the 13th century and includes a restored watermill in the pleasant grounds.",
