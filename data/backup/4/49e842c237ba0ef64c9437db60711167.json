  "description": "This little hamlet in the Yorkshire Dales is known for some splendid limestone scenery. As such it's a popular place for walkers with some peaceful and beautiful countryside to explore. In the village there's also a delightful tea room and a falconry where there's a hands on birds of prey experience. This circular walk from the hamlet visits the neighbouring village of Austwick before heading to Stainforth Force Waterfall. The walk starts in Feizor and follows trails north west to Austwick. The area surrounding this historic village has many ancient remains including extensive walls and structures constructed of slate, limestone, and sandstone. From the village you head east to Flascoe Bridge, Jop Ridding, Wharfe Wood and Swarth Moor where you turn south. Follow the country lane south and it will then lead you to Stainforth where you can enjoy views of the Stainforth Force Waterfall. It's a lovely spot where the River Ribble falls over a series of limestone ledges into a deep, broad pool. In October you can see leaping Salmon on their annual migration up the River Ribble. After enjoying the falls you follow paths south west and then north west to Feizor Thwaite where there's nice views towards Ingleborough. Shortly after you return to Feizor where you can enjoy some refreshments at the fine local tea rooms.",
