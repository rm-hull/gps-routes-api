A notice next to the well tells us that the water is said to possess healing virtues and lucky effects in matrimony. Another notice warns sternly that the water is unfit to drink!"

  "description": "This interesting market town is located in the south eastern part of Cornwall. It's one of the oldest towns in the county and worth exploring for its historical interest. For walkers there's numerous trails to try to the north west of the town on Bodmin Moor. This short walk takes you around the town centre visiting Castle Park and some of the other highlights in the town. These include the 15th century church and the 17th century Stuart House where Charles I stayed in 1644, when his forces were chasing the Parliamentarians.",
