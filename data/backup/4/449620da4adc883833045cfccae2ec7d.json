On the way you'll pass Baston Manor, Hayes Common and Keston Common . The walk starts from the little hamlet of Nash located near Coney Hall. From here you pick up footpaths heading north west to Well Wood before turning north east to skirt the edge of Hayes Common. There's waymarked trails here with attractive woodland and heather moorland to explore. At the common you pick up the London Loop and follow it south east past Baston Manor to visit Keston Common and windmill. The common includes a series of picturesque lakes with more nice woodland trails. You continue south past Keston Court and the interesting site of a Roman Mausoleum.
