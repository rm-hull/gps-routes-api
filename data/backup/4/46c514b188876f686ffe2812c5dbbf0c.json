  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the Blakey Topping standing stones and hill top in the North York Moors. The walk starts from the Crosscliff car park and view point on the northern edge of Dalby Forest . There's nice views from here towards the hill which lies a couple of miles to the north west. From the car park head north west through Crosscliff Wood to the Old Keeper's House with views of the Crosscliff Beck on the way. You then head across Thompson's Rigg before climbing to the ancient standing stones and then on to the hill top which stands at a height of 267 metres. From here there are great views over the hills and countryside of the National Park. The route then descends to Newgate Foot before turning south east along Newgate Moor. A final woodland section through Crosscliff Brow returns you to the car park.",
