  "description": "This circular walk follows the Tall Trees Trail on the Rhinefield Ornamental Drive, Blackwater Arboretum. It's one of the most popular areas of the New Forest with its towering Douglas fir, Giant Sequoia, mighty redwoods and majestic conifers planted in the 1850s. The trail runs for just over a mile on nice flat paths so it's a good walk for families. You can start the walk from the Blackwater car park and follow the trail north to Brock Hill. Then cross the Ornamental Drive and return on the other side of the road. There's also a car park at the northern end of the trail at Brock Hill if you prefer to start from there. Along the path there are information boards telling you about the different types of trees you can see. There's also a picnic area at the car park where you can relax after your exercise. To continue your walking try the Blackwater Sensory Trail which encourages you to discover the many different smells, textures and sounds of the trees. You could also continue north along the ornamental drive and visit the oldest tree in the forest at the Knightwood Oak. You can virtually explore the trail using the google street view link below.",
