The other Pitmilly Mill further up the Kenly Water was also at times called Crail Mill."

  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Fife Coastal Path from Kingsbarns to St Andrews. It's about a 7 mile walk along a fairly flat waymarked footpath. Along the way there are lovely beaches and fine views over the Tay Estuary to the surrounding hills. The walk starts from the public car park at Kingsbarns Harbour. From here you can pick up the trail and follow it north along the coast before turning inland to Pitmilly Mill and Boarhills. This section passes along the picturesque Kenly Water with its weir and waterside farms. The walk then returns to the coast at Buddo Ness, continuing west to Kinkell Ness before finishing at the pier in St Andrews. To continue your walk you could head slightly inland and visit Craigtoun Country Park. There's also the longer Anstruther to Crail Walk along the next section of the Fife Coast Path.",
