  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this delightful conservation village on the western shore of Loch Lomond. If you're visiting the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park then Luss is one of the must see areas. You can catch boat trips from the pier, stroll along the pretty beach and then explore the delightful village with its pretty sandstone and slate cottages. This walk starts at the pier and follows the Luss Heritage Trail through the village to a small woodland area where you pick up a lovely riverside path. This leads you past pretty weirs to the loch, where you will pass the 19th century parish church before returning to the pier. It's a pleasant, varied walk with great views of the loch and woodland, river and lochside sections. If you'd like to extend your walk then you could climb the nearby Beinn Dubh for wonderful views over Glen Luss and Loch Lomond.",
