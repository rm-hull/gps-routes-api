  "description": "This wonderful National Trust owned estate has miles of splendid walking trails to follow. Not to be confused with Hardwick Hall Country Park in Country Durham, Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire is a fine place to stretch your legs if you are in the Mansfield or Chesterfield area. There's 2,500 acres of parkland, woodland, wetland and farmland to explore so you can easily spend a few hours walking the trails. Features in the park include the lovely Lady Spencer's Walk which takes you through bluebell woodland to the surrounding fields and open countryside at the park's eastern end. At the western end of the park there are series of nice footpaths taking you around and between a series of pretty ponds. There's also a rose garden, herb garden and orchards to enjoy. You can also explore the fine 16th century house with its wonderful architecture, golden stonework, expanses of glass and ornate furnishings. To continue your walking in the area head west to Clay Cross and try our Clay Cross and Holmgate Circular Walk. You could also head a couple of miles east and visit Pleasley Pit Country Park. Here you will find a number of walking trails taking you to ponds, reed beds, grassland and woodland. The area also includes the picturesque Pleasley Vale where there's a nature trail running along the River Meden to the old mill buildings. The Teversal Trail passes the southern end of Pleasley Park. This shared cycling and walking trail uses disused colliery lines to form a circular route around the villages of Teversal and Skegby. It visits Silverhill Wood which lies just to the south of Hardwick Hall. The country park has some good woodland cycling and walking trails and also includes the highest point in Nottinghamshire. Also nearby is Pleasley Woods with more good footpaths within broadleaved and coniferous woodland. You can virtually explore some of the parkland and gardens around the hall by clicking on the google street view link below!",
