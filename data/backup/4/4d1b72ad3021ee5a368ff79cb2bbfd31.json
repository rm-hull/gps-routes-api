  "description": "This North Wales village sits in a lovely position on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park and only a short walk from the coast. This walk from the village takes you to the beautiful Morfa Dyffryn Nature Reserve. The walk starts from the fascinating Dyffryn Ardudwy Burial chamber in the village. The ancient site includes a number of photogenic dolmen and a hut circle. There is a small parking area near the chamber at the chapel where you can pick up some pleasant paths around the 6000 year old site. After exploring the stones you can then follow country lanes to the coast and the Morfa Dyffryn Nature Reserve. There's a beautiful beach here with extensive tall sand dunes and a large variety of coastal wildlife to look out for. The area also includes the lagoons at Shell Island and fantastic views of the Rhinog Mountains.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you could head a few miles north to visit the neighbouring village of Llanbedr. Here you can pick up the Llanbedr Walk which will take you to the lovely River Artro Estuary and the Llandanwg Sand Dunes. Just to the east of the village is something of a hidden gem at the wonderful Nantcol Waterfalls. The area includes pleasant trails along the River Cwmnantcol with a series of rushing waterfalls to see along the way. There's also a circular walk around a small reservoir, just west of the falls. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks"
