  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty country park located just to the north of Evesham. There's nice footpaths taking you to wide lawns, orchards, a lake and along the River Avon which runs through the eastern side of the park. You can also enjoy fine views of the surrounding countryside of Evesham Vale. The park is attached to the Valley Shopping area where you'll find a garden centre with a farm shop, clothing stores and eateries, plus a miniature railway. To extend the walk continue south along the riverside path into the town. The trail will lead you to Evesham Lock and the lovely Abbey Park where you will find the ruins of Evesham Abbey. The long distance Shakespeare's Avon Way passes through Evesham. You can follow the trail along the river to the nearby town of Stratford Upon Avon. It's a great way of extending your walking through this delightful area. Just to the west of the town you can pick up the Wychavon Way. If you follow it south you can visit the picture postcard village of Elmley Castle and enjoy a climb to Bredon Hill. There's also a nice circular walk from Ashton Under Hill to try in this area.",
