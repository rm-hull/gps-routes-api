  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk along the beautiful Lunderston Bay in the Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park located on the South Clyde estuary in Scotland. Lunderston Bay has a lovely sandy beach and a central grassy area with picnic benches. National Cycle Network route 75 runs along the bay so its perfect for a safe, easy waterside cycle. Loch Thom is located a couple of miles inland. There's a nice circular trail running around the peaceful loch. Also near here is the Greenock Cut Visitor Centre which provides lots of useful information on all the walks in the area.",
