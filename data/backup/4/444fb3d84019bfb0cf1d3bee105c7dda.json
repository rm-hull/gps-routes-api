The forest is home to many species of wildlife such as badgers, roe deer and nightjars, as well as five species of bat. There are also several different species of trees including oak, beech, ash, alder and hazel. Sitka spruce is the prevalent tree species accounting for 30% of all trees in the forest. Other noteworthy flora includes narrow leaved marsh orchids, yellow bird's-nest and violet crown cup. There are four Sites of Special Scientifica Interest (SSSI) within the forest at Ellerburn Bank, Ellers Wood & Sand Dale, Seive Dale Fen and Troutsdale & Rosekirk Dale Fens."

No fire tower is apparent here despite it being indicated on a recent 1:25000 Ordnance Survey Map. 150 million years ago, the region now enveloped by the forest was submerged underwater. Fossils dating from this epoch are scattered throughout the entire area. The primary soil composition on the moorland and spurs consists of Middle calcareous grit, or sandstone. In other areas, Hambleton Oolite Limestone and Yedmandale Limestone, along with sandstone, are prevalent. Mudstone, also known as Oxford Clay Formation, dominates the valley floor, with some pockets of peat bogs interspersed throughout. The forest is situated on an ascending terrain, ranging from an elevation low of 60m in Thornton Dale to a peak of 248m. Four principal water valleys traverse the landscape: Thornton Dale, Trouts Dale, Stain Dale, and Deep Dale. These dales were formed by the runoff of meltwater from glacial ice fields during the Devensian period."

  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this large forest in the North York Moors. The forest has lots of different cycling trails to try. These range from easy family routes to challenging trails for experienced mountain bikers. You can hire a bike and then pick one of the colour coded trails. The easy green route is a great one for families while the 21 mile red route is a more challenging single track trail. The trails start from the Dalby Visitor Centre on Dalby Forest Drive. There's also miles of country lanes to follow through the forest and its surrounding area. For walkers there are also several good trails to choose from. The trails are of varying lengths and difficulty. You can try easy waterside walks around the pretty Staindale Lake or along Ellerburn Beck. There are also longer walks to the sandstone sculptures of the Bridestones or to Adderstone Rigg. This area of the North York Moors is great for walking and cycling with Wykeham Forest just a few miles to the east. Here you'll find more mountain bike trails and some climbs to great viewpoints. The circular Hackness Walk visits the forest from the nearby village. You can follow a pleasant riverside path along the River Derwent from the settlement to the forest. The Tabular Hills Walk long distance trail also runs through the woods. The waymarked 48 mile trail takes you across the southern boundary of the North York Moors National Park from Scarborough to Helmsley. The forest is located close to the ancient market town of Pickering where you can visit Pickering Castle and enjoy countryside trails along the Pickering Beck.",

      "content": "Just to the north of the forest there's a few worthy sites to visit. About 2 miles north east of the car park you'll find a series of fascinating sandstone sculptures at the Bridestones. These date back to the Jurassic period 150 million years ago and are a highlight of the area. Near here you'll also find the stunning Hole of Horcum. This beautiful natural amphitheatre is located on Levisham Moor and another must see in the area. On the western side of the moor you'll find the wonderfully positioned Skelton Tower. The tower dates from 1830 and sits perched high above the moor in a dramatic and picturesque spot. There are great views over Goathland Moor and the steam trains of the North York Moors Railway below. It's a great spot to take some stunning photos. At the northern edge of the forest there's the climb to the ancient standing stones and fine viewpoint at Blakey Topping. This circular walk starts from the Crosscliff car park and viewpoint at the northern end of Dalby Forest. For more walking ideas in the area see the North York Moors Walks page."
