  "description": "This walk from the Oxfordshire village of Blewbury visits the Iron Age Hillfort at Blewburton Hill. The hill is located a short distance to the east of the village and the walk includes a visit to the nearby village of Aston Tirrold. It's a 3 mile walk with a small climb and some nice views over the surrounding Oxfordshire countryside to enjoy on the way. The walk starts in the village of Blewbury, located just to the south of Didcot in the North Wessex Downs. From here you can pick up footpaths heading east up to Blewburton Hill. The univallate  hill fort may have been occupied from the 4th century BC to the 1st century BC. Interesting finds at the site include Neolithic or Early Bronze Age flints recovered during excavations, and a polished stone axe found in the ditch near the entrance. Although there was no Roman occupation of the hilltop, a number of fragments of Roman pottery were recovered, dating to the 1st century AD, and the 3rd\u20134th centuries AD. After exploring the hill the walk descends to the village of Aston Tirrold where you could stop for refreshments at the local pub. The walk then returns to Blewbury on the same paths. To continue your walking in the area head south and pick up our Streatley Circular Walk which uses part of The Ridgeway National Trail. You could also head to nearby Goring and enjoy a riverside walk along the Thames Path .",
