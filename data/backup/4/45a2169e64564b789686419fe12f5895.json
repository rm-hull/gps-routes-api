Surprisingly it is not here as the result of having cleaved off the mountain, as it is of a completely different rock\u00a0! So it is assumed that it was pushed here by a glacier during the Ice Age - and probably originated in Scotland. Its name most likely comes from the Norse god Odin's son, Balder. It's easy to get to the top and have a sit thanks to these thoughtfully provided steps which have been here in one form or another since the C19th century"

  "description": "This short walk visits the interesting Bowder Stone in the Borrowdale area of the Lake District National Park. The large stone is located just to the south of Derwentwater, near Grange. You can visit the site by parking at the National Trust public car park and following a pleasant woodland footpath south the photogenic stone. It's a pleasant, easy stroll which takes around 10 minutes or so. The huge boulder is an impressive sight standing at a height of about 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) and weighing around 2000 tons. There is a 19th century staircase which you climb to the top of the stone. From there you can enjoy fine views over the area before ambling back to the car park. The stone is located just a short distance to the east of Castle Crag . This is another popular walk in the area and well worth an extension to your outing. The hill stands at a height of 290\u00a0m (950\u00a0ft), offering fine views over Borrowdale from the summit. Also to the west of the stone you can pick up the Allerdale Ramble and Cumbria Way waymarked trails. There's some nice riverside trails along the River Derwent to follow into Rosthwaite .",
