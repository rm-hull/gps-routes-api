  "description": "This walk visits an Elizabethan manor house near Oakham. The historic house was built on the site of a 12th century Augustinian priory, Launde Priory. The house includes some attractive grounds with landscaped gardens and parkland containing mature trees. You can visit the abbey tea rooms and then explore the area around the delightful estate on a number of footpaths. Highlights include an 18th-century stable block, a chapel, a pretty pond, an early 19th-century ha-ha, a walled garden and a glasshouse. There's also a country lane which is suitable for cyclists. This circular walk explores the countryside surrounding the abbey, using a section of the Leicestershire Round and other public footpaths. To continue your walking in the area head east to the lovely waterside paths at Rutland Water .",
