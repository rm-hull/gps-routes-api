  "description": "This pretty village is located close to Southam and Leamington Spa in the county of Warwickshire. The village includes a noteworthy 13th century church and an historic 16th century pub. This route uses a section of the Warwickshire Centenary Way and other local footpaths to create a circular walk to the south of the village. On the way you'll visit the Bishops Bowl Lakes and the neighbouring village of Bishop's Itchington. There's some nice countryside views to enjoy on this fairly easy, flat walk.",
