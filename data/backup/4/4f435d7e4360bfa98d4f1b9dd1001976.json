  "description": "Willen Lake is Milton Keynes most popular park with a super waterside cycling and walking path to enjoy. The easy circular trail runs for a distance of about 2.6 miles around the perimeter of the lake. There's also pedalos, mini-golf and a cafe at the site. If you would like to continue your outing you could pick up the nearby Grand Union Canal Walk or the Hanslope Circular Ride. Just to the north west you will find Linford Lakes -a lovely nature reserve in Milton Keynes with a number of pretty lakes and ponds. If you head a couple of miles south along the Grand Union Canal you'll some come to Caldecotte Lake where you can enjoy more waterside walking and cycling.",
