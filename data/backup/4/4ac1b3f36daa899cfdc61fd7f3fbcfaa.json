  "description": "Enjoy a stroll alongside this lovely reservoir near Corby. You can park at the car park at the north eastern end of the water off Main Street in Stoke Dry. The village of Stoke Dry is reputed to be the place where the Gunpowder Plot was hatched. It  has an interesting medieval church dedicated to Saint Andrew. You can pick up country lanes heading north along the reservoir from the car park. The area to the south is private land so please do not enter this section. The area includes nice views of woodland and lots of wildlife. Look out for badger, fox, otter, muntjac deer, osprey, red kite, buzzards and various wildfowl on the water. Sightings include widgeon, pochard, teal and smew. It's a beautiful area with the reservoir surrounded by rolling countryside of Leicestershire, Rutland and Northamptonshire. If you'd like to extend your walk you could pick up the Rutland Round which passes the reservoir. You could head to nearby Uppingham and Wardley Wood or the village of Lyddington. Here you can visit the Grade I listed Lyddington Bede House, owned by English Heritage. You can explore the country lanes on the western side of the reservoir using the google street view link below.",
