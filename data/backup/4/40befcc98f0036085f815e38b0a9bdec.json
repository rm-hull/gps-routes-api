  "description": "A walk through Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk from Manningtree to Brandon. The walk begins in Essex at Manningtree rail station and heads through Dedham, Sudbury, Bury St Edmunds and Thetford before finishing at Brandon. You begin with a pleasant waterside stretch from Manningtree to Sudbury along the River Stour, passing Dedham on the way. Also of note is the 16th century Willy Lott's Cottage - scene of the famous Hay Wain painting by John Constable.The path continues to Bury St Edmunds passing the National Trust owned Melford Hall stately home, Kentwell Hall and the village of Lavenham as you go. The next stage runs from Bury St Edmunds to Thetford, following the River Lark before a wooded section through King's Forest. A wildlife rich section through the lovely West Stow Country Park and Lackford Lakes Nature Reserve follows soon after. At Thetford you will pass the ruined priory and join the Little Ouse River, which you follow through Thetford Forest to the finish point at Brandon.",
