  "description": "This large area of woodland in Argyll and Bute has miles of cycling and walking trails to follow. There's also a series of impressive waterfalls, streams and rivers to enjoy. You can start your outing from the car park next to the Eas Urchaidh waterfall on the River Orchy. Cross the bridge over the river to enter the woodland and pick up the trails. They run through the woods to the village of Bridge of Orchy where you can cross the river and follow country lanes along the river and back to the car park. Here you can get great views of the surrounding hills. To extend your walk you can pick up the West Highland Way at Bridge of Orchy and follow it to the nearby Loch Tulla on the Bridge of Orchy to Kingshouse Walk. The Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy Walk follows a popular section of the trail south to Tyndrum via the Old Military Road. If you are coming by public transport then you could also start the route from the train station at Bridge of Orchy.",
