  "description": "This popular circular walk visits Erris Head in in northwest County Mayo near Belmullet. The loop takes you around the northernmost point on the Mullet Peninsula with fantastic sea views and rocky cliffs. The area is also great for wildlife with lots of seabirds and seals to look out for on the way. Keep your eyes peeled for fulmars, great black-backed gulls, peregrine falcons and choughs as you make your way along the 5km (3 mile) trail. Start the walk from the loop walk car park and then head north along the trail following the waymark posts. Along the way there's information boards, boardwalks and grassy paths.",
