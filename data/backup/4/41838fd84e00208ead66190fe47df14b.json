  "description": "This pretty riverside village is located in Powys near Hay on Wye. It sits on the Wye Valley Walk, a long distance waymarked footpath exploring the beautiful valley of the River Wye. The village also lies just north of the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons where there are some wonderful hill climbs and lakeside trails to try. This walk takes you along a pleasant section of the Wye Valley Walk to the neighbouring villages of Boughrood and Llanstephan. The route follows a fairly flat waymarked footpath which runs close to or along the river. It's about a 6 mile walk with some lovely views of the Wye Valley countryside to enjoy on the way.",
