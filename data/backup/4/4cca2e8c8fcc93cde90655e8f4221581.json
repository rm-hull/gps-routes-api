  "description": "The Lincolnshire town of Grantham has some delightful waterside walks along the canal and the River Witham. The other major walking highlight is the beautiful Belton House, just to the north of the town. The National Trust owned site includes a series of nice footpaths taking you to an Orangery, an Italian garden with fountains, a maze, a deer park and several delightful lakes and ponds. This is a popular stroll taking you along the Grantham Canal to the nearby village of Denton. Here you can enjoy more waterside paths along Denton Reservoir before visiting the village and enjoying refreshments at one of the pubs or cafes. Just to the west of Denton you can pick up the Viking Way long distance trail. It's a great way of exploring the area to the west of the town. If you pick up the waymarked path and head west it will take you to Woolsthorpe by Belvoir and Belvoir Castle. The expansive Belvoir estate is great for walkers with miles of trails including the Jubilee Way which starts in Woolsthorpe.",
