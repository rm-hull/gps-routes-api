The Timespan Heritage Centre in the village offers a look into the region's history with immersive displays and audio-visual exhibits, covering periods from ancient history through to more recent events.\nA short trip up the Strath of Kildonan leads to Baille an Or and Suisgill, locations tied to the \"Great Sutherland Gold Rush\" of 1869. It began when Robert Gilchrist, who had spent 17 years in the Australian gold fields, made the first gold discovery upon returning home. This sparked a rush of prospectors to the area, and a small shanty town quickly formed. Although the boom was short-lived, traces of gold are occasionally still found.\nEach year, Helmsdale also hosts traditional Highland Games, held in a stunning setting overlooking the village."

      "caption": "River Helmsdale from Telford's Bridge. The river also known as the River Ullie (Scottish Gaelic: Ilidh / Abhainn Ilidh), is a major eastward-flowing river in the Highlands of Scotland, primarily in the Sutherland region. Originating from Loch Badanloch, the river travels southeast through the Strath of Kildonan (or Strath Ullie), collecting waters from several tributaries along its course. Key tributaries include the Bannock Burn on its left side and the Abhainn na Frithe on its right, with additional significant inflows from the Suisgill Burn (left bank) and Craggie Water (right bank).\nThe river passes Loch Achnamoine about 1.5 km downstream from Loch Badanloch before finally emptying into the Moray Firth on the North Sea, at the coastal town of Helmsdale. Loch Badanloch is part of a network of interconnected lochs, alongside Loch nan Cl\u00e0r and Loch Rimsdale, which gather water from the southern Flow Country moors, receiving streams like the Allt an L\u00f2in Tharsuinn, Allt L\u00f2n a' Ch\u00f9il, and Rimsdale Burn."
