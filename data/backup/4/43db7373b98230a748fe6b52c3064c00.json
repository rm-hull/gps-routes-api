  "description": "This circular walk visits the delightful Cotswolds village of Great Tew. There's some nice walking trails to follow around the Great Tew Estate and into the surrounding countryside. The route runs for just over 2 miles, with lovely views of the estate parkland and the surrounding Cotswolds countryside. Start the walk from the car park in the village and then head east along the footpaths around Great Tew Park. The paths then loop round the estate before returning to the village. On the way you will pass the noteworthy parish church. The church was originally Norman, and the south doorway from about 1170 survives from that period. It was rebuilt in the 13th century with the arcades of stone pillars inside the building and the south porch still in existence. The church is reached by passing through a splendid 17th-century gateway. Take time to explore the village and you will pass lots of lovely 17th century thatched cottages. You can then enjoy refreshments at the Falkland Arms public house which has a nice outdoor seating area. You could extend the walk by continuing north east along the footpath to the nearby village of Nether Worton. To continue your walking around Great Tew head west to Chipping Norton and visit the Rollright Stones. The fascinating group of Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monuments are one of the highlights of the area. To the south of Little Tew you can pick up the Shakespeare's Way long distance trail around the village of Church Enstone. The Wychwood Way also runs through the area and will take you south towards Charlbury.",
