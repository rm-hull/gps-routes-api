  "description": "This walk visits Yateholme Reservoir in Holmfirth. You can follow trails around the small reservoir and enjoy some fine views over the surrounding moors. The trail runs for about a mile with some pleasant woodland encircling the site. Ramsden Reservoir and Riding Wood Reservoir are very close by so it's easy to extend your walking around these two other bodies of water. The transmitter and viewpoint at Holme Moss lies just to the west.",
