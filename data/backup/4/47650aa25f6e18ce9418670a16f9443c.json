It is now used as a railway walk."

  "description": "This easy route follows a dismantled railway line from Wolverhampton to Pensett. It runs for about 11 miles along the old Wolverhampton to Dudley railway line. The line was closed in 1965 but is now a leisure route suitable for walkers and cyclists. Along the way there's some nice woodland sections, a nature reserve and views of the local river and canal. The route starts at Aldersley Stadium, just to the north west of the centre of Wolverhampton. The trail then heads south west, running alongside the Smestow Brook and the River Stour. This opening section passes Newbridge, the Smestow Valley Park Nature Reserve and Compton. The nature reserve is particularly pretty with peaceful trails and lots of flora and fauna to look out for. You then leave the river and head through Castlecroft and Lower Penn to Wombourne. This is a popular and scenic area which includes the lovely Bratch Locks on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. There is also a nice cafe for a pit stop. The route continues south through Wombourne before passing through the woodland of the Himley Plantation. Here you branch round to the east, passing Himley and Kingswinford before finishing at Pensett, just north of Brierley Hill.",
