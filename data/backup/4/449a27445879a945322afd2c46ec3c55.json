  "description": "Enjoy a walk alongside this pretty reservoir in the Peak District. A trail runs for several miles along the water with some stunning scenery. You can start the walk from the large car park just to the south of Torside Reservoir on Woodhead Road. You then follow a shared cycling and walking trail east to Woodhead Reservoir. The trail runs along the southern side of the water with nice views to the surrounding countryside and hills. To extend the walk pick up the Longdendale Trail and head west to visit Valehouse and Bottoms Reservoir .",
