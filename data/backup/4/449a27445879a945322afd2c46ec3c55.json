  "description": "Enjoy a walk alongside this pretty reservoir in the Peak District. A trail runs for several miles along the water with some stunning scenery. You can start the walk from the large car park just to the south of Torside Reservoir on Woodhead Road. You then follow a shared cycling and walking trail east to Woodhead Reservoir. The trail runs along the southern side of the water with nice views to the surrounding countryside and hills. To extend the walk pick up the Longdendale Trail and head west to visit Valehouse and Bottoms Reservoir .",

The 16th century pub does very good food and has a nice cosy fire for winter days. You can easily find the pub in the village at a postcode of SK13 1JY for your sat navs. It's also very dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."

      "content": "There's another car park slightly closer to the reservoir at Crowden on the northern side. You could start the walk from here if you prefer and cross to the southern side on the bridge. The Crowden Black Hill Walk also starts here and climbs to the highest point in the historic county of Cheshire. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page. The Trans Pennine Trail heads north east from the site. You could follow it up to the nearby Winscar Reservoir to extend the walk. At the eastern side of the reservoir there's another car park where you can start the Middle Black Clough Waterfall Walk. The area is a bit of a hidden gem with walks along the River Etherow to some beautiful waterfalls and wonderful rock formations. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
