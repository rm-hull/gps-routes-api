The site might have been inhabited during the Romano-British period, as indicated by various artefacts from that era found on the peninsula. However, there's no definitive evidence of any Roman structures there. It became a settlement in the early medieval period, likely serving as one of the seasonal abodes of the regional king of Dumnonia. In the 13th century, during the High Middle Ages, Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, constructed a castle on this site. Over time, the castle deteriorated and eventually became a ruin."

The initial church on this site was likely established in the 6th century, founded as a subsidiary church of Minster. These are the only churches dedicated to the saint, who is commonly associated with Madryn, Princess of Gwent, although some have proposed that the dedication might be to Saint Marcellina, the sister of Saint Ambrose. The current structure of the church likely dates back to the late 11th or early 12th century. Noted art historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in 1950, indicated that its Norman-era architecture incorporates some Saxon elements, while the tower could have been constructed in either the 13th or 15th century."

Tintagel features prominently in the literary world, being used by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in his poem \"Idylls of the King\" and by Algernon Charles Swinburne in \"Tristram of Lyonesse\". Additionally, Thomas Hardy's play \"The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse\", published in 1923, continues to explore the same legendary narrative.\nTourists have the opportunity to visit King Arthur's Great Halls in Trevena, an impressive structure from the early 1930s. The discovery of the Artognou stone in 1998 further fueled the legend associated with Tintagel, although historians generally do not believe the inscription on the stone is directly linked to King Arthur."

  "description": "Explore the pretty village of Tintagel and visit the spectacular coastal castle. The walk starts in the village and then takes you over a bridge to the island where you enter the courtyard through a gate. Here you will find 18 acres to explore with a garden, chapel, tunnel, well and the remains of the Great Hall.\nYou continue along the beautiful coast path to Lye rock before returning to the start point in the village. The area is steeped in Arthurian legend with the walk taking you past King Arthur's Hall in Tintagel village. This historic building contains works of art telling the story of King Arthur and is a popular visitor attraction. The South West Coast Path runs past the castle so you could continue your walk along this long distance trail towards Boscastle. The walk from the village is a very popular way of visiting the castle. It's about a 4 mile route along a rugged piece of coast. You can see more details on the Boscastle to Tintagel Walk page.",
