The large church is essentially 13th century when it was rebuilt, including its tower \u0096 now with a peal of eight bells cast in 1809."

  "description": "This picturesque Buckinghamshire based village includes a pretty duck pond, a fine old church and quaint thatched cottages. There's also some excellent walking through the surrounding countryside of the Thame Valley. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring settlements of Dinton, Nether Winchendon and Cuddington. There's also nice views of the River Thame and a visit to the attractive Eythrope Park Estate to enjoy on the way. The trail makes use of the Aylesbury Ring and the Thame Valley Walk, two long distance waymarked footpaths which run through the countryside surrounding the village. In the villages there's quaint thatched cottages and historic churches to see.",
