  "description": "This picturesque Buckinghamshire based village includes a pretty duck pond, a fine old church and quaint thatched cottages. There's also some excellent walking through the surrounding countryside of the Thame Valley. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring settlements of Dinton, Nether Winchendon and Cuddington. There's also nice views of the River Thame and a visit to the attractive Eythrope Park Estate to enjoy on the way. The trail makes use of the Aylesbury Ring and the Thame Valley Walk, two long distance waymarked footpaths which run through the countryside surrounding the village. In the villages there's quaint thatched cottages and historic churches to see.",

Here you'll find woodland trails, Victorian style gardens, a parterre with ornate fountains and a working aviary with a rose garden. Just to the west is the neighbouring village of Long Crendon. Here you'll find a number of medieval timber framed properties including Long Crendon Courthouse which dates to the 15th century and is run by the National Trust. From the village there is also a pleasant footpath to the remains of Notley Abbey, an Augustinian abbey founded in the 12th century and located in a scenic spot by the River Thame.
