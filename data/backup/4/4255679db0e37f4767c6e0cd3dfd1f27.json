  "description": "This walk visits a fascinating abandoned village on the Dorset coast. The village was deserted during the second world war when all the residents were told to leave so the area could be used for military training.\u00a0Tyneham is part of the Lulworth Range Walks an area still owned and used by the military. It is only open at certain times - please see the link below for more details. This circular walk takes you around the village before visiting the viewpoints at Povington Hill and Tyneham Cap. The walk starts from the free public car park in the village at a postcode of BH20 5DE for your sat navs. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north through the village to the quarry near Whiteway Hill. Turn east and the footpaths will take you up to Povington Hill where there is a picnic area and fine viewpoint to the coast. The route continues east to West Creech Hill before before following country lanes and bridleways south. The route then turns west to climb up to Tyneham Cap where there are more great views. Shortly after you turn north to return to the car park.",
