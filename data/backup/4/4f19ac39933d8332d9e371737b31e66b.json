  "description": "This pretty Warwickshire village is directly on one of the UK's major waymarked footpaths. There's also a wildlfie rich local nature reserve and a good village pub to enjoy refreshments after your exercise. The settlement\u00a0was formely known as 'Snytenfeld' meaning 'open field of Snipe'. It recieved the name due to a large\u00a0population of the wading birds\u00a0inhabiting the meadows near the Sherborne Brook that\u00a0runs through the village. This walk from the village follows the Monarch's Way south to visit Welcombe Hills Country Park before continuing to Stratford Upon Avon . The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the waymarked long distance trail and follow it south through the countryside to the Welcombe Hills, passing Snitterfield Reservoir on the way. There's some excellent views from this elevated park. The area is also a nature reserve with grassland, woodland and ponds. After enjoying the views the route continues south into Stratford, finishing at the famous Royal Shakespeare theatre next to the River Avon.",
