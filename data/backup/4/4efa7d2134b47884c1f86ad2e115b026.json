  "description": "This walk visits the Cholmondeley Castle estate, located in the village of Cholmondeley near Malpas in Cheshire. The 19th century castle is surrounded by 70 acres of beautiful parkland and gardens with a series of well laid footpaths to try. Features in the park include a herbaceous border, Folly Water Gardens, Rose Garden, Glade, Arboretum, a lakeside trail and the ornamental woodland upon Tower Hill. You can extend the walk by heading north through the old castle estate on public footpaths towards Bulkeley Hill. To the north west there's the climb to Bickerton Hill and Maiden Castle where you can enjoy wonderful views over the area from the ancient hill fort.",

Bunbury locks and the associated village of Bunbury are located just to the north. The impressive staircase locks on the Shropshire Union Canal and the delightful historic settlement are well worth a visit."
