  "description": "This country park and nature reserve is located near Epsom in Surrey. Here you will find a rural landscape of fields, hedgerows, woods and ponds of great wildlife and historical value. There are 400 acres of attractive parkland to explore on a series of well laid out trails. The park is open to cycles with lovely flat paths like the one in the video below to enjoy. If you would like to continue your exercise you could head to the nearby Epsom Common or Ashtead Common National Nature Reserve which have more cycling and walking paths. The Three Downs Link and the London Loop trails also run past the park.",

It runs past the famous Chessington theme park before visiting Ashtead Common and Epsom Common. It then picks up the London Loop to visit Horton Country Park and Chessington village.
