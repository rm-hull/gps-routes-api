There's a lovely harbour and bay with fine views to the surrounding islands of Kerrera and the Isle of Mull. This walk in the town takes you up to a fine viepwoint on McCaig's Tower before heading along the front to the cathedrals. The walk starts at the train station and heads north east through the town to climb to McCaig's Tower. There's excellent views over the town and the bay from this 19th century folly. The route then heads along the attractive promenade where you can enjoy a fine view across Oban Bay to Kerrera Island in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. For detailed information on the town's history, climate, culture, local attractions and transport links see the informative wikipedia page.",
