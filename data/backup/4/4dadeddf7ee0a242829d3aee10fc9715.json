  "description": "This circular loop walk takes you around Brantry Lough near Dungannon in County Tyrone. The site has a parking area on the south eastern side of the lake where you can start your walk. From here you can pick up the pleasant, waterside trails around the lough. The trail runs for just under 2.5 km with some fine views across the water. It should take around 45 minutes to complete the walk. The lake is part of the Eglish Heritage Trail and includes some peaceful deciduous woodland as well. If you would like to continue your walking around Dungannon then you could visit the nearby Oxford Island Nature Reserve. The large reserve is located on the shores of Lough Neagh and consists of reed beds, open water, species rich wet grassland, wildlife ponds and wildflower meadows. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Dungannon. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
