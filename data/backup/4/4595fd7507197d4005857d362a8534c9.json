The tunnel was completed in 1839 by George Stephenson and is 1,784 yards long and Clay Cross High Street is 150 feet above the line. The tunnel eventually cost \u00a3140,000 instead of \u00a398,000 with the lost of 15 lives. As the tunnel was bored out they found coal and iron in large amounts and so George Stephenson opened Clay Cross Company."

  "description": "A circular walk through the countryside surrounding the towns of Clay Cross and Holmgate in North East Derbyshire. The 6 mile walk uses sections of the waymarked South Chesterfield Way and Chesterfield Round footpaths to explore the area's farmland and woodland. There's moderate climbs along the way with some nice views over the surrounding Derbyshire countryside to enjoy. The walk starts in Clay Cross and heads west to Kenning Park where there's some nice paths and a pretty lake. The route then climbs to the west towards Woodhead where you'll climb to a height of nearly 700ft. Here you turn north to head to Broomy Wood, Coldwell Farm and Britton Wood. At Press Farm you turn east through Hardwick Wood, Cowlishaw Wood and Mulberry Wood. The route then heads south past Old Tupton and Hilltop Farm before returning to Clay Cross. Just to the east of Clay Cross you can extend your walking at the lovely Hardwick Hall .",
