  "description": "Enjoy a lovely stroll around the 78 acre grounds of Lytham Hall on this short walk in Lancashire. The walk takes you through the delightful archway and up the long driveway with super views of the farmland within the grounds. You then head through peaceful woodland to the two pretty duck ponds passing the dovecote on the way. Other highlights include the 17th century mount which you can climb for super views of the grounds. There's also delightful gardens and a wide lawn perfect for picnics. In February the snowdrop walk is particularly popular and in the spring you'll see lots of bluebells. The woodland paths are lined and surrounded by thousands of the pretty flowers for several weeks of the year. As of 2014 the grounds are subject to major improvements including the creation of an Italianate parterre garden to mimic the original one. The grand 18th century Georgian hall has a fascinating history and many splendid rooms to explore. Home to the influential Clifton family for several centuries the hall is now run by the Heritage Trust for the North West. Excellent guided tours of the house are available on certain days. The hall is located just a short distance from the coast where you could pick up the Lancashire Coastal Way and head towards Blackpool if you would like to continue your walk. You can also explore the Ribble Estuary with its wide variety of coastal birdlife.",
