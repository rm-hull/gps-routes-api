  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Lough Shannagh in the Mourne Mountains. The walk starts from the Ben Crom Reservoir wall just east of the lough. You can catch shuttle busses to here from the Silent Valley. From here you can pick up a footpath heading west to Lough Shannagh. Here you will find a trail heading south along the reservoir to the sandy beach at the southern end. There's great views across the still waters to the surrounding mountains. To the north you can climb to Slieve Loughshannagh for some great views back down to the lake. To continue your waterside walking in the area head south to visit the Silent Valley Reservoir. There's lovely woodland trails to follow along the River Kilkeel with smaller ornamental lakes to enjoy as well. Also nearby is Spelga Dam. There's waterside trails along the lake shore at the southern end of the reservoir with a nice picnic area at the northern end.",
