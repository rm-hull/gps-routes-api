It was once a minor tourist hub with its own railway station in the early 20th century, though today it\u2019s known for its unspoiled charm and absence of facilities. Take care on the rough paths and enjoy the tranquillity of this stunning coastline."

Flora along the path changes with the seasons, featuring hardy coastal plants such as thrift, sea campion, and heather, which thrive in the salty air and exposed conditions. These species contribute to the rugged beauty of the landscape, complementing the vibrant wildlife. The cliffs and coves have long attracted visitors for their wild splendour and the thrill of peering into the churning waters below."

  "description": "The walk around the Bullers of Buchan offers a dramatic and memorable exploration of Aberdeenshire\u2019s coastline. Starting from the car park, you\u2019ll follow the Buchan Coastal Path, which winds along cliffs offering striking views of a collapsed sea cave\u2014locally called a \u201cpot\u201d\u2014that forms a vast, bowl-like formation open to the North Sea. The pot is connected to the sea by a natural arch, providing a glimpse of the power of coastal erosion over millennia. As you continue along the path, you\u2019ll encounter several distinctive rock formations, including the towering Temptin Rock, other sea stacks, and narrow inlets, all sculpted by relentless waves. The cliffs are alive with seabirds, including guillemots, kittiwakes, razorbills, shags, and puffins during their breeding season. You might also spot grey seals bobbing in the waters below or, with luck, dolphins further out to sea. You can extend the walk by heading south to explore the historic ruins of Slains Castle .",
