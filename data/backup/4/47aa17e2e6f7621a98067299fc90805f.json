  "description": "This country park and nature reserve is located between Bolton and Manchester in Salford . Situated on the River Irwell it contains a pretty lake, woodland, meadows and an arboretum. The Irwell Sculpture Trail walking route runs through the park where you will find two of the sculptures from the trail. A cycle trail also runs through the park so you can bring your bike. The park is good for wildlife too so look out for the horses near the car park and various water loving birds on the lake. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to Blackleach Country Park . Here you'll find a nice walking trail along a pretty lake with lots of birdlife to look out for. Also nearby is Moses Gate Country Park . The park covers 750 acres with a number of nice cycling and walking trails to try. The site is located on the outskirts of Bolton and includes three lakes while the Rivers Croal and Irwell also run through the park. Additionally, the Outwood Trail runs past the park along a disused railway line.",
