  "description": "Follow the Ebor Way from Helmsley to Ilkley on this walk through Yorkshire. The first section runs from Helmsley to York, passing Hovingham and the ruined Sheriff Hutton Castle, before a short section along the River Foss leads you into York. After leaving York following the River Ouse, you head towards Tadcaster where you join the River Wharfe taking you to Boston Spa and Wetherby. Here you continue to Otley, passing the impressive Harewood House which is a major route highlight. The house was built in the 18th century and has wonderful art collections while there is also a Bird Garden and over 100 acres of beautiful gardens to enjoy. The final section of the walk runs from Otley to Ilkley through Ilkley Moor, passing the famous Cow and Calf Rocks and the historic village of Burley in Wharfedale on the way. The walk is waymarked with a green and white disc.",
