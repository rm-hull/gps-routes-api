  "description": "This is a circular walk around the town of Barrow in Furness in Cumbria. The walk explores the remains of the iron mining industry in the area. You will pass Newton, Little Urswick, Lindal, Askam in Furness and Marton. The walk follows the coastal path along Duddon Sands with fabulous views of the Cumbrian hills and mountains. The coastal section also passes the Sandscale Haws National Nature Reserve Nature Reserve which is well worth exploring if you have time. Also of interest is the 12th century ruined monastery of Furness Abbey located on the outskirts of Barrow-in-Furness.",
