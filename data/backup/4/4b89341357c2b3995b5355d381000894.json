  "description": "A nice circular walk around the Somerset village of Dundry, exploring the expansive Dundry Hill which surrounds the village. There's some lovely countryside and great views of the Chew Valley to the south and the city of Bristol to the north. The hill is also geologically significant with a limestone cap formed during the Jurassic period. It's also rich in fossils and freestone which has been quarried since Roman times. Look out for a variety of flora and fauna as you make your way across the hill. You may see birds including Buzzard, Stonechat and Perigrine Falcon. In the meadows you can see lots of wildflowers including orchids and knapweed. The walk starts next to the church in the village and heads east on tracks and footpaths to East Dundry. You then follow country lanes west to Dundry Down, where you will reach a height of over 700ft. The route then returns to the village where you can enjoy refreshments at the Dundry Inn and visit the historic church which dates from the 15th century. The Three Peaks Walk passes the hill on the eastern side. You can easily pick up the long distance trail to extend your walk. Follow the trail east and it will take you up to Maes Knoll Iron Age\u00a0hill fort. At the western end you can pick up the Monarch's Way . Following it north will take you to the Barrow Gurney Reservoirs and Long Ashton . Heading south will take you towards the lovely Chew Valley Lake , Litton Reservoir and Blagdon Lake .",
