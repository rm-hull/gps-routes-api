The shepherd's mobile hut has a small exhibition inside it. The road is the A259 which has just descended Exceat Hill and is about to cross the valley floor along an old medieval causeway."

In 2009 the pier was up for sale for a guide price of \u00a35million. The fire of 30th July 2014 saw the arcade section of the pier destroyed."

The former village church of Exceat was located on the western side of the hill above a valley that was often flooded. The village itself appears in the Domesday Book but appears to have suffered during the 14th century to French raiding parties, poor harvests, repeated flooding and the Black Death so that by the 15th century it was reported that no inhabitants were left. The church fell into disrepair and the former parish of Exceat was amalgamated with that of nearby Westdean in 1540."

  "description": "This walk takes you from the Exceat visitor centre in the Seven Sisters Country Park, to the seaside town of Eastbourne. The walk runs for a distance of just under 10 miles using a coastal section of the The South Downs Way National Trail. The route is waymarked throughout and includes a few moderate climbs as you traverse the wonderful sea cliffs on the way. The area is also great for flora and fauna with  Lapwing, Skylark and Perigrin Falcon to look out for. There's also lots of pretty wildflowers and butterflies in the summer months. Start the walk from the car park at the visitor centre at a postcode of BN25 4AD. From here you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it south along the Cuckmere River toward Cuckmere Haven. The route then turns east to follow the coast path to Birling Gap. This area includes the picturesque Belle Tout lighthouse and a National Trust cafe where you could stop for refreshments. It's a popular spot with some spectacular views to enjoy from the cliff top. The route continues east to Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in Britain. It's another fine spot with views all the way to West Sussex and Kent. After taking in the views the route then descends to Eastbourne, passing along the seafront before finishing at the pier.",
