King Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1539. At Newark, the prior was pensioned off, valuables sent to the Tower of London and the land given to the Master of the Kings Horse. It has been said that a cannon was employed from the top of Church Hill to bombard or demolish what were the then extensive buildings! This incident is portrayed in one of a series of paintings made by artist Tessa Kewen in 1963 which are displayed in the porch of St Nicholas Church."

The church is located about a 1\u20444 mile north of Newark Priory along a medieval lane and was built around 1140. It is thought likely that Queen Elizabeth I would have worshipped at St. Nicholas Church. She reputedly donated a silver chalice to the church in 1570. The church grounds and the surrounding lands are designated a conservation area, having special architectural and historical importance"

  "description": "This walk visits the historic Newark Priory on the River Wey near Ripley in Surrey. The route also visits the significant old church in Pyrford village and the pretty Pyrford Lock which is located just up the river. The walk starts from the Newark Lane Car Park next to the river and Newark Lock. The route then follows the Wey Navigation east, passing Newark Lock and the island where you can see the priory from the river. The priory was established in the 12th century and is notable as one of the monasteries that was dissolved during the reign of King Henry VIII. Today it is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. The route continues north east passing Pyrford Golf Course before coming to Pyrford Lock.The lock is a very photogenic area of the canal with barges and a nice canalside pub. At the lock you leave the river to follow country lanes to Pyrford village. Here you'll find the noteworthy Church of St Nicholas. The church is a fine example of a complete Norman church and is one of few medieval churches in the country in the top category of listed building. After exploring the chuch you head past the golf club to return to the river and then follow the waterside path back to the car park.",
