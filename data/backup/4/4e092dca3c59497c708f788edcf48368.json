  "description": "The attractive market town of Diss has some nice options for walkers with the pretty mere and the River Waveney in the vicinity. This circular walk uses a section of the Angles Way long distance trail to take you to the Roydon Fen and the Wortham Ling Nature Reserves. It's about a 4 mile route, taking place on easy flat footpaths and country lanes. The walk starts in the town centre next to the mere. From here you can pick up the Angles Way and follow it west to Roydon Fen. The footpaths take you through the reserve where you can see typical fen plants such as marsh helleborine, marsh fragrant orchid and sawsedge. The path continues to Wortham Ling where there are more nice trails to follow. The reserve includes acid grassland and dry heath on a sandy soil. Look out for wildlife including rabbits and butterflies in this area. After exploring the reserve the route follows country lanes back into Diss. To extend the walk you could continue west along the Angles Way and visit the lovely Redgrave and Lopham Fen Nature Reserve. Covering an area of 125 hectares, it is the largest remaining area of river valley fen in England. The reserve includes lots of wildlife with the Konik ponies of particular interest. The Boudicca Way long distance trail also starts in Diss. The trail runs all the way to Norwich, passing Shotesham, Saxlingham Nethergate and Pulham Market on the way.",

The trail will take you south to the nearby town of Eye where you can visit the 11th century Norman castle and a particularly fine 16th century pub. Near here there's also the noteworthy village of Thornham Magna where you can try the Thornham Walks on the old Thornham Estate. The estate is a great place for easy walks with pleasant woodland trails and a particularly lovely walled garden."
