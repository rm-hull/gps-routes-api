  "description": "Enjoy the spectacular East Cliffs of Folkestone, the sandy beaches of East Wear Bay and the Warren nature reserve on this circular walk. The attractive park is formed of the East Cliffs of\u00a0Folkestone, the sandy beaches of East Wear Bay and the land-slipped\u00a0nature reserve\u00a0land between the cliffs and the sea. In the park there's some wonderful coastal views, interesting flora and fauna and three\u00a0old Martello Towers to see. These were built on the east cliffs in the early 19th century to protect against the French invasion of\u00a0Napoleon. You can extend your walking in the area by picking up the North Downs Way and following it east to the nearby Samphire Hoe Country Park . Our Folkestone Walk starts at Lower Leas Coastal Park and takes you to all three of Folkestone's coastal park. You could also continue to Folkestone on our Dover to Folkestone Walk which takes you between these two Kent ports.",
