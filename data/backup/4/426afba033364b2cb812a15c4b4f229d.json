  "description": "Enjoy the spectacular East Cliffs of Folkestone, the sandy beaches of East Wear Bay and the Warren nature reserve on this circular walk. The attractive park is formed of the East Cliffs of Folkestone, the sandy beaches of East Wear Bay and the land-slipped nature reserve land between the cliffs and the sea. In the park there's some wonderful coastal views, interesting flora and fauna and three old Martello Towers to see. These were built on the east cliffs in the early 19th century to protect against the French invasion of Napoleon. You can extend your walking in the area by picking up the North Downs Way and following it east to the nearby Samphire Hoe Country Park. Our Folkestone Walk starts at Lower Leas Coastal Park and takes you to all three of Folkestone's coastal park. You could also continue to Folkestone on our Dover to Folkestone Walk which takes you between these two Kent ports.",

There's fine views over the Channel Tunnel Terminal and the coast from this viewpoint. Near here there's also the worthy village of Lyminge where you will find an ancient 10th century church and access to the popular Elham Valley Way. To the north there's the Alkham Valley where you'll find an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The valley includes some fine footpaths and two significant historical sites including the ruins of St Radigund's Abbey and the 11th century St Peter's Church. There's also a fine local pub in the pretty village of Alkham here. At the eastern end of the valley you could visit the noteworthy Kearsney Abbey. There's some beautiful gardens here with ornamental lakes and views of the River Dour the highlights."
