  "description": "This attractive market town is located in a fine position in the North York Moors National Park. There's a number of attractive Georgian and Victorian buildings and the picturesque River Leven running through the town. Here you'll also find the photogenic Pack Horse Bridge dating from the 17th Century. Also of note is the Church of St Peter and Paul, with its famous mouse woodwork carved by Robert (Mouseman) Thompson. The furniture maker set up a business manufacturing oak furniture, which featured a carved mouse on almost every piece. This walk from the town follows the River Leven east to the neighbouring town of Great Ayton. The route runs for about 2.5 miles on a fairly flat path with nice views of the river and surrounding countryside. Start the walk from the eastern side of the town where you can pick up a public footpath heading east along the Leven. You'll pass farmland, old bridges and a ford before arriving in the attractive village of Great Ayton. Along the way there's fine views to Roseberry Topping, one of the scenic landmarks of the area.",
