  "description": "This village in the Craven of North Yorkshire has some nice trails along the local canals and river which run through the area. This circular walk around the village visits the Huddersfield Broad Canal, the River Calder and Bradley Park. The walk starts to the east of the town centre where the canal and the river meet. Follow the canal south and it will take you past Colne Bridge and the aqueducts to Deighton and Fieldhouse Bridge. Here you leave the canal and head north through Woodhouse Hill and Riddings to link up with the Kirklees Way. The trail will take you past Bradley Woods and Bradley Park before returning to the village.",
