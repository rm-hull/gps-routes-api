  "description": "This village (also known as Dinas Powis) is located a few miles from Cardiff in the Vale of Glamorgan. It's an attractive village with a number of listed buildings, some peaceful local woods and a river running through it. The village has a nice rural feel and includes a large village common and some nice pubs. This makes it a popular day trip for people coming from Cardiff. This circular walk from the village visits Dinas Powys Woods, the neighbouring village of Michelston-le-Pit and the Cadoxton River at Cwrt-yr-ala. The walk starts in the village, near to the train station. From here you pick up footpaths heading north through the woods to the river. Here you can see the Salmon Leaps, soome pretty lakes and a series of rushing weirs. The route then heads east to visit the little village of Michelston-le-Pit. The village is built near the confluence of two small streams, which join to form the Cadoxton River. From here you head south, following the river back to the village, passing the remains of the castle on the way.",
