  "description": "Climb the highest peak in South Wales and southern Britain on this stunning walk in the Brecon Beacons National Park. This is a challenging climb to the 2906 feet (886m) summit but the footpaths are generally very good for most of the walk. You start at the car park at Storey Arms about 10 miles north of Merthyr Tydfil. There is an alternative car park at Pont ar Daf just to the south if you prefer. The first stage passes through woodland and crosses Blaen Taf Fawr before ascending toward Bwlch Duwynt. You continue to Corn Du where there are fabulous views of the Neuadd Valley, Cantref Reservoir, Beacons Reservoir and Llwyn-on Reservoir. Shortly after you reach the summit of Pen Y Fan where you will find a former Bronze Age burial chamber. The views are fantastic with Sugar Loaf, the Bristol Channel, Carmarthen Bay, Swansea Bay, the Gower Peninsula, the Black Mountains, the Cambrian Mountains and Exmoor all visible on a clear day. From the summit you descend to Corn Du and then on to the heather covered Y Gyrn. You soon come to a woodland area and the finish point at the car park. For an alternative route to the summit try the wonderful Pen y Fan Horseshoe Walk. This fantastic ridge walk starts from the car park in Taf Fechan Forest and visits the Upper and Lower Neuadd Reservoirs, Corn Du and the Cribyn. The Brecon Beacons Way runs past the mountain so you could pick this up to continue your walk. Beacons Reservoir is also very near the start point to the walk so you could enjoy an easy waterside stroll here too.",
