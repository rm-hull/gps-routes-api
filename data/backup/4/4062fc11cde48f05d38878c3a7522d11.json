  "description": "This circular walk takes you up to the Mellor Cross on Mellor Moor in Greater Manchester. You can start your walk in the village and then follow tracks south past the golf course to Black Lane. Turn east here and it will take you to the cross which is positioned at a height of around 327 metres on the moor. The large cross marks  the site where John Wesley preached during the 18th century. Wesley was a leader of a revival movement within the Church of England known as Methodism. From the elevated position of the cross there are fine views over the surrounding countryside of the Goyt Valley . After taking in the views you can follow Primrose Lane past Cobden Edge to return to the village. Here you can visit St Thomas's Church which sits in a photogenic hill top position.",
