  "description": "Explore 170 acres of woodland and parkland in this park near Grangemouth. There are a network of paths taking you around the woodland, parkland, gardens and riverside. Highlights in the park include the River Avon, a spectacular river gorge and the historic Avon Aqueduct. The park contains an excellent visitor centre in the old farmhouse. Muiravonside is located just a couple of miles from Linlithgow and about five miles from Falkirk. One good option is to follow the Union Canal from the centre of Linlithgow to the park - a walk of about 2.5 miles. You could then visit Linlithgow Loch and enjoy more waterside walking. Also nearby is the splendid Beecraigs Country Park. Here you can try the Lochcote Reservoir and Cockleroy Hill Walk and enjoy some splendid views over the Bathgate Hills.",
