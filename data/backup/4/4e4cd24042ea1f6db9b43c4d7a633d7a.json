  "description": "This lovely walk follows the Saxon Shore Way and the Royal Military Canal Path from Hastings to Winchelsea . It's an 8 mile route, running along two good waymarked trails with some moderate cliff top climbs along the way. It's a really beautiful part of the country with splendid views of the High Weald from the wonderful cliff tops. The walk starts on the seafront in Hastings and heads east to Hastings Country Park .  The park is located in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with most of the site designated as a Special Area of Conservation and a Local Nature Reserve. It's a great place for wildlife watching with Peregrines, black redstarts and fulmars on the coastal cliffs, while Dartford warblers, stonechats and yellowhammers can be seen on the gorse covered hills. After leaving the park you continue to the picturesque Fairlight Cove where there's a nice beach and more stunning cliffs. The route then passes Cliff End where you pick up a flat section along the Royal Military Canal to Winchelsea. The walk can be extended by continuing along the Saxon Shore Way through Rye Harbour to Rye.",
