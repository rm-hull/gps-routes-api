  "description": "This walk follows a section of the South West Coast Path from Minehead to Porlock and Porlock Weir along the beautiful North Somerset coast. The walk runs for a distance of just over 8 miles with some moderate climbs to splendid viewpoints on the National Trust's Holnicote Estate. The walk starts at the harbour car park in Minehead and follows the waymarked coast path north west through woodland to Greenaleigh Farm. You continue west past North Hill to the splendid viewpoints at Selworthy Beacon and Bossington Hill. You then reach the coast at the scenic Hurlstone Point before heading along Porlock Bay to finish at Porlock Weir.",
