  "description": "This pleasant circular trail explores the area to the south of Whitby. On the way there's lovely views of the Esk Estuary and the heritage steam trains running along the Esk Valley Railway. Starting at Whitby train station you pick up the Esk Valley Walk and follow it south past Fishburn Park and Boghall towards the neighbouring village of Ruswarp. The route follows the opening section of the Esk Valley Railway which runs heritage trains through the North York Moors to Middlesbrough. In the village of Ruswarp you'll find an old station on the line and a 120ft high viaduct, which was built to carry the now closed Scarborough to Whitby railway line. Known as the Larpool Viaduct it is now owned by Sustrans and carries the Cinder Track, a shared cycling and walking trail runnning to Robin Hood's Bay. In Ruswarp you'll also find an old church, a good range of shops and a local pub. After exploring the village you then cross the railway line to follow country lanes round to the viaduct. You can then cross back to the other side while enjoying fine views over the countryside from the impressive structure. The route then retraces its steps back into Whitby.",
