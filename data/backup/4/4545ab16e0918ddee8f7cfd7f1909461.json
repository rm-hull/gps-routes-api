  "description": "A lovely circular walk taking you to the villages of Compton and Littleton before visiting the delightful Loseley Park, near Guildford in Surrey. The walk starts near Compton and makes use of a section of the North Downs Way to take you through the peaceful woodland of East Warren and West Warren, to the north of Loseley Park. You then turn south to Littleton before following public footpaths which skirt the edge of Loseley Park. For a fee you can gain full access to the grounds which include a series of stunning gardens. This walk follows publicly accessible paths to Polsted Manor before returning to the start point. It's east to extend the walk by continuing east along the North Downs Way towards Guildford. Here you can pick up waterside paths along the Wey South Path and Guildford Canal Walk. Just to the west you can enjoy a series of woodland trails and two large ponds at Puttenham Common .",
