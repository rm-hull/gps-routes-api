  "description": "This circular walk from the market town of Pershore visits some of the highlights of the area. You'll visit Pershore Abbey before enjoying a riverside path along the River Avon. The trail then explores the peaceful woodland trails in Tiddesley Wood before returning to the abbey. The walk starts in the town centre at the historic abbey which is surrounded by a lovely park. The abbey was one of the largest medieval abbeys in Britain but was destroyed in the Reformation. The abbey church still exists and includes a beautiful interior and a lantern tower dates which from 1350. From the abbey you head south east to meet up with the River Avon. Follow the riverside path west and it will take you to Tiddesley Wood. These woods are also a nature reserve with a number of good footpaths to try. They are really special during the spring months when there are carpets of bluebells, wood anemones, violets and cowslips. After exploring the woods you head east past Orchard Farm and Cornmore before returning to the river path. This will take you back towards the town centre and the abbey.",
