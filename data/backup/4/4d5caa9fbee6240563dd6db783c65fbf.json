This scenic location has also been used as a filming site for various movies. In 1996, the dramatic landscape featured in Breaking The Waves, where a mock cemetery was constructed for filming, and remained in place for some years after the production. More recently, in October 2012, scenes from 47 Ronin starring Keanu Reeves were filmed on the headland at Neist Point."

  "description": "This walk visits a photogenic lighthouse at Neist Point, the most westerly point on the Duirinish peninsula of the Isle of Skye. The walk runs for about 1.5 miles and should take around 30-60 minutes to complete. There is a car parking area just to the north of the lighthouse where you can pick up a footpath heading south to Ness Point. There are some fantastic cliff tops views and lots of wildlife to see in the area too. A steep path leads down from the road. Look out for dolphins, porpoises, whales and basking sharks in the waters below. There's also lots of seabirds including razorbills, gannets, black guillemots, and European shags. You can extend the walk by heading north east around Loch Mor. To the east there's also some fine trails in the grounds of Dunvegan Castle. To the north there's Waternish Point where you'll find an ancient ruined church and the Vaternish Lighthouse.",
