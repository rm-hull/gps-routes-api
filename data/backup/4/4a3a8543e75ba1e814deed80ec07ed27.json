  "description": "Follow the Cleveland Way from Whitby to Staithes on this walk along the North Yorkshire Coast. The walk is just over 11 miles with spectacular coastal scenery, cliff top views, pretty beaches and lovely fishing villages to see on the way. Starting at the striking ruins of Whitby Abbey the walk heads north west to Sandsend . You'll pass along the lovely beaches at Whitby Sands, Upgang Beach and Sandsend Beach. Here you can take a slight detour away from the coast by heading into Mulgrave Woods . There's nice peaceful trails to follow around this site with becks, waterfalls and the interesting ruins of Mulgrave Castle. You continue past Kettleness to the noteworthy Runswick Bay. The picture postcard fishing village is a highlight of the Yorkshire coast with its sandy beach,\u00a0sheltered bay and pretty little cottages. The final section takes you past Hinderwell and Port Mulgrave where you will pass Rosedale Cliffs. Shortly after you come into Staithes, passing along the attractive harbour before finishing at Staithes Beck. The area is well known for its geology with\u00a0Jurassic\u00a0(Lias), strata cliffs and fossils of\u00a0ammonites to be found at nearby Port Mulgrave. There's also a number of fine pubs where you can refresh yourself after the walk. To extend the walk you can continue along the Cleveland Way to Skinningrove where the ruined remnants of the old mines can be seen from the cliff top.",
