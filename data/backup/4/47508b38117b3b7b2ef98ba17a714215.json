    "description": "Enjoy miles of walking and cycling trails through this large country park in Cumbernauld. This previously uninspiring area has been transformed with the planting of thousands of native trees and shrubs. The park is now a haven for wildlife attracting roe deer, badger, fox and hare. Birdwatchers should look out for sparrowhawk, kestrel, long-eared and short-eared owl. Palacerigg also has a collection of rare breed animals including Eriskay ponies, North Ronaldsay sheep, Shetland cattle, Guernsey goats and Tamworth pigs. In the park you can follow 10km of nature trails which will take you through the grassland, moorland and woodland of the park. There are also water features to enjoy with several ponds and the picturesque Fannyside Lochs on the eastern side of the park. You can find out more about the trails and guided walks at the countryside ranger service within the park. Other facilities include a field archery course, golf course, children's play area, gift shop, cafe and picnic sites. Palacerigg is located less than half an hour's drive from Glasgow, Motherwell, Stirling or Falkirk .",
