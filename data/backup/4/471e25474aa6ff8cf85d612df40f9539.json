The bay sits at the western end of the region known as the Back of the Wight or the West Wight which is a popular tourist area. It is banked by some impressive steep chalk cliffs. The village is also noteworthy as the birthplace of physicist Robert Hooke who, using a microscope, was the first to visualize a microorganism. It is also notable as the home of Poet Laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson. He was the Poet Laureate during much of Queen Victoria's reign and wrote the famous poem \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\"."

  "description": "Cross the western side of the Isle of Wight from north to south on the Freshwater Way trail. It's a 3.5 mile walk taking place on generally flat paths along the pretty estuary of the River Yar. The walk starts in Yarmouth near to the main parking area and the tourist information centre. Follow the path west over Yar Bridge with nice views of the boats in the harbour. At Norton Spit, turn south and follow the path to Kings Manor Farm. Just before you reach the farm you have the option of taking a detour and heading west to Norton Green and Golden Hill Country Park. There's some nice woodland trails and attractive parkland surrounding a former Victorian fort. The final section of the walk heads through Easton before finishing at Freshwater Bay where there is a nice beach and cliff views. Around Afton Manor the path splits to give and alternative route heading to Afton Down and Compton Bay. This section involves more climbing so a reasonable level of fitness is required. The Isle of Wight Coast Path is directly accessible at either end of the route. You can pick up the coastal trail to further explore the island. Just to the east you can also pick up the Hamstead Trail and Tennyson Trail .",

This artillery fort was built by Henry VIII in 1547 to protect Yarmouth Harbour from the threat of French attack. These days it's a lovely spot to enjoy a picnic and enjoy fine views across the Solent. To the east there's Newtown where you'll find a delightful village with a wildlife rich National Nature Reserve and an interesting local history. For more walking ideas in the area see the Isle of Wight Walks page."
