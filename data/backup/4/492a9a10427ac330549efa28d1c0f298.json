  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this lovely park in Ryton, Warwickshire. The park covers 100 acres and includes a number of cycling and walking trails, a large area of peaceful woodland and the four tranquil pools after which the park is named. Ryton Pools also includes a visitor centre, bird hides and a miniature railway. The route below takes you through the park and then to some of the nearby woods. The park can be found just a few miles north east of Leamington Spa. If you would like to continue your walk the Coventry Way and the Warwickshire Centenary Way both pass near to the park. The delightful Brandon Marsh Nature Reserve is just to the north of the village of Ryton-on-Dunsmore. Here you'll find nice footpaths taking you around a series of lakes and lagoons.",

The former is particularly noteworthy with its Norman church, Grade II listed 16th century inn and the Berkswell Windmill which dates back to 1826. The epic Heart of England Way can also be picked up in this area. Just to the north there's the suburban village of Binley Woods where you can enjoy some pleasant trails around Brandon Woods. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
