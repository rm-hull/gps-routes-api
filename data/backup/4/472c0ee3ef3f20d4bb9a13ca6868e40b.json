  "description": "This town in central Ireland includes an historic castle, pretty local parks and nice walks along the River Shannon. This walk in the town takes you along the River Shannon to visit Burgess Park on the eastern side of the river. You can start the walk from the medieval castle where there are some fine views over the town from the battlements. You can then cross the Shannon Road Bridge where there are lovely views along the river. On the other side head south and the riverside path will take you to Burgess Park. The park is a fine place for a stroll with good surfaced paths taking you to a memorial garden, playground, and recreational areas. To continue your walking around Athlone head north to pick up the Lough Ree Park Walking Trail. There's some lovely views across the expansive lough from this pretty waterside park.",
