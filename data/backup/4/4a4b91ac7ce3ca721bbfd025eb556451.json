This intricate arrangement has been put in to allow horse riders and cyclists to use the bridleway, the Cefn Ffordd track that we are standing on, but prevent use by scramblers. The bridleway continues along either the road or the track ahead. The road is the exit for vehicles from the Ffynnon Oer wind farm behind us, and was presumably the route for construction vehicles about 3 or 4 years ago. The road and the adjacent track are a dog-leg in the Coed Morgannwg Way. The St Illtyd's Walk also comes up the track we are standing on, and goes off on the track to the right."

  "description": "A religous walk from Pembrey Country Park (Carmarthenshire) to Margam Country Park (Neath). The path runs through Hendry, Pontardawe and Bryn.    You will visit Penlle'r Castell ruin on the summit of Mynydd y Betws (with fabulous views), the spectacular Melincourt Falls on the Neath River and the Vale of Neath. There are also splendid views of the Black Mountains and peaceful wooded sections near Abercregan. The two splendid country parks at either end of the walk are also real highlights on this challenging walk. Near Swansea the route also skirts the edge of the wonderful Cwm Clydach National Nature Reserve. It's worth taking a small detour from the route to explore the reserve with it's woodland, wildlife, rivers and waterfalls. The walk is waymarked with a white and yellow disc.",
