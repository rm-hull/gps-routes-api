  "description": "This attractive Cornish town is close to the coast and a wonderful National Trust Estate with a large lake. There's also some nice trails along the River Cober and a local hill climb offering fine views over the area. The town is notable for its heritage railway and as the most southerly town on the island of Great Britain. This circular walk from the town visits Loe Bar and the Penrose Estate before heading to the coast to neighbouring Porthleven. The walk starts at the Coronation Lake car park just to the south of the town. You can then follow footpaths south to the Loe Bar Lake and the National Trusts's Penrose Estate. The route continues to the coast where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it north west along the beach to Porthleven. The route passes along the pretty harbour before following country lanes back to Helston.",
