  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside walk or cycle around Chasewater in Burntwood, near Lichfield . The park is nearly 900 acres in size with over 200 acres of water. A cycling and walking path runs right around the perimeter of the large lake.  There is also a steam railway, bird hides and a visitor centre. For those wishing to continue their exercise the Beacon Way links to the park. For cyclists there's National Cycle Route 5 running through the area as well. The park is great for wildlife too with deer often spotted around the lake.",
