  "description": "The Mapledurham estate is a wonderful place for a relaxing afternoon walk. The house is located on the River Thames with the picturesque Old Watermill right beside it. The mill is still operational and dates from the 15th century. The route below is circular, starting at the house and taking you on a tour of the woodland and countryside in the estate. The park is located near Caversham in Oxfordshire. The estate is located on the Thames Path so you could continue your walk along the river. For example if you head east you will soon come to the delightful Caversham Court Gardens. Heading west will take you to the pretty village of Pangbourne where you can visit the delightful water meadows and enjoy a stroll along the River Pang .",
