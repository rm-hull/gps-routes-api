  "description": "This delightful Warwickshire village has some lovely river and country trails to enjoy. Features in the historic settlement include a Grade I listed bridge dating from the early 15th century and Big Meadow, a 26 acre recreational park next to the river. There's also some lovely riverside pubs to relax in after your exercise. This circular walk from the village takes you along the river to visit neighbouring Welford before heading through the countryside to Dorsington. The route makes use of the Avon Valley Footpath and the Heart of England Way which run through the area. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Avon Valley Footpath and follow the waymarked trail east along a pleasant riverside path to Welford. Here you'll find a number of attractive Tudor half-timbered and thatched cottages. You then head south west, following footpaths through farmland to Braggington and Dorsington. The route then heads north west towards Barton before returning to the river and following it back into Bidford.",
