  "description": "A walk along the Bridgewater canal, through Cheshire, Greater Manchester and on into Lancashire. The route passes Salford , Trafford, Altrincham , Manchester, Warrington and Halton. Along the way you'll pass a series of nice parks including Dunham Massey , Worsley Woods and Sale Water Park. The path also forms part of the longer Cheshire Ring Canal Walk which follows six historic canals through Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Staffordshire. When complete the Bridgewater Way will also be open to cyclists.",
