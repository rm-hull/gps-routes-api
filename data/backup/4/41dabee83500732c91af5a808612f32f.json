Medieval chronicles associate Caplie with St. Adrian (or St. Ethernan) who was killed on the Isle of May in 875 by Viking raiders. Christian crosses carved into the wall of Chapel Cave give credence to the theory that this was a shrine to the martyred saint."

  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of the Fife Coastal Path from Anstruther to Crail. It's roughly a four mile walk, passing along a fairly flat section of the path. Along the way there's fine coastal views and a series of photogenic rock formations, weathered caves and cliffs to see. The walk starts from the attractive harbour in Anstruther, following the waymarked trail north east past Cellardyke\u00a0Habrour, Cardinal Steps and the activities centre. You continue past Caiplie to Hermit's Well and The Coves before passing Maggie Brady's Rock and finishing at the harbour in Crail. To continue your walking along the coast path you could head to St Andrews or Pittenweem .",
