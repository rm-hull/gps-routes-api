  "description": "A circular walk around the beautiful Little Langdale in the Lake District. The walk visits some of the highlights of the area including Little Langdale Tarn, the River Brathay and the striking Cathedral Cavern. The route runs for about 5 miles on reasonably flat paths with a moderate climb on the return leg. Start the walk from the car park in Low Tilberthwaite, next to the Yewdale Beck and below the Furness Fells. From here you can pick up paths heading north along the Pierce How Beck to Moss Rigg Wood. Around here you can visit the intriguing Cathedral Quarries. The expansive cave system includes the 40ft high Cathedral Cavern which can be reached from a tunnel maintained by the National Trust. After exploring the caves the route then passes along the River Brathay before crossing the water and heading north to the village of Little Langdale. Here you can enjoy refreshments at The Three Shires Inn which was built in 1872 and is named after the Three Shires Stone two miles away. There's a delightful garden to sit out in and enjoy fine views of the Tilberthwaite Fells. From the village you can pick up a country lane to take you around the back of Little Langdale Tarn. There's lovely views down to the water where you may see great crested grebe if you bring your binoculars. Follow the lane to Fell Foot Bridge where you cross the river and the Greenburn Beck. The route then heads south along tracks, passing the Atkinson Coppice before returning to the car park. To continue your walking in the area you could visit the lovely Blea Tarn which sits in a hanging valley between Little Langdale and the larger Great Langdale to the north. Here you can enjoy terrific views of Lingmoor Fell, Pike of Blisco and the other surrounding Langdale fells. You could also head to the nearby village of Elterwater and try the Elterwater Waterfalls Walk or visit Skelwith Bridge .",
