  "description": "Explore 230 acres of parkland in this beautiful country park in the heart of Buchan. Scenery in the park includes peaceful woodland, a lake and a Victorian arboretum. There are also farm buildings built around 1800, a ruined mansion house and a coach house built in 1832 which now houses the award winning Aberdeenshire Farming Museum. In the park there are number of well-maintained tracks perfect for an easy stroll or a safe family cycle ride. Trails include: The Children's Trail - a short family trail visiting various sites of interest in Aden. Woodland Walk Trail - a longer trail of about 2.5 miles visiting the Victorian Arboretum, Ice House, North Lodge, Lake, and SANDS garden. Tree Trail - Enjoy conifer and broadleaf trees with descriptions on this short 1 mile trail. The Formartine and Buchan Way also passes through the park so there is scope for continuing your outing along this popular trail. Just to the north of the park you will find the lovely Pitfour Lake . The lake has good walking trails along the water and through the surrounding woodland. The park is located in Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire about 8 miles east of Peterhead.",
