  "description": "The Yorkshire village of Scalby sits a few miles north of Scarborough, a couple of miles inland from the coast. This circular walk takes you along the Scarborough Sea Cut or Scalby Beck, a small river running through the area. You can start the walk in the village and then head south to pick up the waterside trail. Follow it west and it will take you to Mowthorpe Bridge where you turn south to enter Raincliffe Woods. Here you can pick up peaceful woodland trails heading north east towards Throxenby Mere. This part of the walk is great for wildlife spotting with deer, badgers, squirrels, frogs, toads, foxes and various woodland birds to look out for. In the spring months there are also lots of bluebells. The route then turns north to follow country lanes back towards Scalby Beck and the village.",
