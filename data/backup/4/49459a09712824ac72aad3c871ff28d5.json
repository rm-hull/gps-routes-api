  "description": "This large area of woodland, grassland and farmland has miles of tracks and trails suitable for cyclists and walkers. In the park you'll find a Georgian manor house, peaceful woodland trails and chalk grassland with lots of wildflowers and butterflies to see. Look out for wildlife which includes roe deer, badgers, foxes and woodpeckers. The route starts from Box Hill and Westhumble Train Station although you could also start from the nearby car park. Follow the trails up to Denshire Hill and Fetcham Downs where there are splendid views over the Surrey Hills. Continue north towards Hawk's Hill on the outskirts of Leatherhead before turning round. The trails then take you south through Druids Grove and Beechy Wood before returning you to Westhumble. The Mole Gap Trail runs along the eastern edge of the park. It's a great way to extend your walking with nice riverside trails along the River Mole. You can follow it north to Leatherhead or south to Dorking. Just to the south east you will find Ranmore Common and Denbies Hillside where there's miles more trails to try. The park is also very close to the popular Box Hill Country Park. It's a great place for walking and cycling with more great views and the lovely stepping stones on the River Mole.",

The main draw here is a wonderful garden terrace where you can enjoy your meal with panoramic views of the Mole Valley. On colder days you can sit inside next to the crackling log fire. You can find the pub at Byttom Hill, Mickleham with a postcode of RH5 6EL for your sat navs."
