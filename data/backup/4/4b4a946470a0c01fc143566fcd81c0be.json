  "description": "This Essex based village is located just east of Rochford on the River Crouch. It's a nice place for a peaceful, easy walk with flat country footpaths and riverside trails to enjoy. This circular walk starts from the Plough and Sail Pub in Paglesham East End. The pub dates back over 300 years and has a car parking area. From here you can pick up footpaths heading east to join with the River Roach. A riverside path along the sea wall will then lead you west to Barton Hall where you can pick up the Roach Valley Way. Follow the waymarked trail north west to South Hall Farm and Paglesham Church End. From here it is a short walk north to Paglesham Creek where public footpaths run east to Paglesham Pool. You can then head south to return to the pub. To continue your walking in the area head east to explore Wallasea Island. The island is a great place for bird watching with a wide variety of species visiting the RSPB reserve.",
