  "description": "This circular walk from Ringwood takes you to some of the highlights of the area. You'll visit the lovely Blashford Lakes Nature Reserve and the expansive Rockford and Ibsley Commons where there are miles of nice trails to try. The walk starts from the car park in the town centre near the tourist information centre and Bickerley Common. From here you can pick up the Avon Valley Path and follow it north through the town to Blashford Lakes. There's a series of nice footpaths to follow around the site which includes several pretty lakes and a number of bird hides. From here you can look out for many different types of bird including woodpecker, nuthatch, grey heron, great crested grebe, coot and sand martin. After exploring the lakes the walk then enters the adjacent Ibsley and Rockford Commons. There's miles of heathland and woodland trails here with pretty heather, gorse and grazing New Forest Ponies to see here. After rounding the woodland inclosures on the common the trails return to Blashford where you can pick up the Avon Valley Path and follow it back into Ringwood. To continue your walking from the town you could pick up the Castleman Trailway and follow it west to Moors Valley Country Park. The expansive park is a great place for mountain biking and walking. You could also follow the river path north to Fordingbridge or head north west from the town to try more woodland trails in Ringwood Forest.",
