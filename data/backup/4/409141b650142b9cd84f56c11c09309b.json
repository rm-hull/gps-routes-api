Its distinctive remains will be familiar to anyone who has travelled the A149 towards Hunstanton, standing high on a hill at church farm. The building and its surrounding area were the subject of a live dig by the Time Team programme in 1998."

  "description": "This country park near King's Lynn has nice trails to follow around around birch covered hills and a Scandinavian style lake. It's a delightful spot with the lakes surrounded by attractive woodland and small cliffs. There's also little beaches and picnic areas. You can park at the car park at the north eastern end of the lake, off Gayton Road. From here you can pick up the trails to take you around the site. N.B Please do not swim in the waters of the lake. It may look tempting but several people have got into difficulty. To continue your walk you can head north and visit Roydon Common. The pretty nature reserve includes a large area of heathland and woodland with Dartmoor Ponies to look out for.",
