These would have been dug as deep pits through the layers of chalk and poor flint to a good seam of flint about 30 feet below. This would have been worked out horizontally, and hauled to the surface here, within the safety of the ring fortifications. Flints were used as tools and weapons. This was all stone age stuff, 5,000 years ago."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the South Downs to the north of this West Sussex seaside town. On the way you'll pass an Iron Age Hillfort, enjoy riverside paths along the River Adur and pay a visit to Bramber Castle. The route uses sections of the South Downs Way and the Monarch's Way, two waymarked trails which run through the area. The walk starts from the Storrington Rise car park in the Findon Valley area of the town. From here you can pick up footpaths taking you up onto the South Downs. Follow the trail east and you can visit the historic hillfort at Cissbury Ring where there are fine views to enjoy. After exploring the fort you pick up the Monarch's Way and follow it north east to the attractive bowl shaped valley at Steyning Bowl. Near here you can pick up the South Downs Way and head east towards Botolphs where you can pick up a riverside path along the River Adur. Follow the path north and will take you to Upper Beeding and the historic Bramber Castle. The castle ruins date all the way back to the 11th century and the site includes a church which is still in use today. After exploring the castle the route picks up the Monarch's Way again and follows it west towards Steyning Bowl and Canada Bottom. After passing Cissbury Ring again you descend back to the car park.",

There's also nice coastal paths along the Worthing Esplanade and beach. Heading west along the coast path will take you to the nearby town of Littlehampton. The neighbouring town is well worth a visit with its two award winning beaches, some fine architecture and the longest bench in Britain to see. You can also pick up the the Arundel to Littlehampton River Walk here and enjoy a walk along the River Arun to Arundel and its historic castle. Just to the north east is the Lancing Ring Nature Reserve. The reserve is a great place for wildlife walks with splendid views over the Adur Valley from the high points. For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks and South Downs Walks pages."
