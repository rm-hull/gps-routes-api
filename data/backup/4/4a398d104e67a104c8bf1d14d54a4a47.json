Viewed looking north-eastwards from the southern end, in 2002 this was certainly a popular lake for anglers and model boat enthusiasts, but despite its name I don't think that the general public were allowed to take to the water...! This pleasant park is a nice place for a stroll in the town."

  "description": "This is a delightful 31 mile circular walk which visits a number of pretty villages and parks around the town of Corby in Northamptonshire. You start off at East Carlton Park on the edge of the Welland Valley and follow the path through a series of pretty villages including Wilbarston, Geddington, Great Oakley, Gretton, Rockingham, Stanion and Brigstock. Walk highlights include a visit to the 17th century Elizabethan House at Kirby Hall . The Great Hall and state rooms are impressive as are the surrounding grounds of the estate. Rockingham Castle is another major attraction on route. Built on the instruction of William the Conqueror, the castle's Great Hall and Long Gallery are particularly noteworthy, while the 18 acre gardens are also well worth exploring.
