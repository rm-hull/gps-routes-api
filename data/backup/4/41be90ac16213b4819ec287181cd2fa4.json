  "description": "A circular walk which takes you around both Grasemere Lake and Rydal Water. It runs for just over 5 miles visiting some of the local historical sites with some lovely waterside paths along the way. The walk starts in the village of Grasmere and follows roads south east towards Town End and Dove Cottage, the former home of poet William Wordsworth. During the period of his habitation, William wrote much of the poetry for which he is remembered today, including 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud'. For a fee you can explore the fascinating old house and then browse the adjacent museum where you will find exhibits, manuscripts, landscapes and portraits. The route then passes the woodland of White Moss Common before picking up the popular Coffin Route which runs to Ambleside. The path is so called because it was used to convey coffins on their final journey to St Oswalds Church in Grasmere. This route follows it as far as Rydal Mount and Rydal Hall where there are some pretty gardens and a rushing waterfall to see. The walk then turns south to cross a bridge over the River Rothay before picking up woodland paths to take you to Rydal Water. Here you can follow a lakeside trail along the southern side of the lake before a short climb takes you to Grasmere Lake. You'll pass the rushing weir and then pick up another lakeside path which runs for just over half a mile along the lake. A footpath then climbs towards a country lane which you can follow back into Grasmere.",
