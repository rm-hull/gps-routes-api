  "description": "This walk follows a section of the wonderful Jurassic Coast from the town of Sidmouth to the village of Beer in Devon. It's a popular coastal walk running for about 8 miles along an undulating path. There's lovely cliff top views, attractive beaches and interesting geological features to see on the path. Also look out for Exmoor Ponies on the way! Starting on the front in Sidmouth head east, crossing the River Sid. You then pass the lovely Salcombe Hill Cliffs and Chapman's Rocks before coming to Dunscombe Cliffs. You may see Exmoor Ponies and lots of butterflies fluttering around the wide variety of wildflowers you can find in this area. The route continues past Salcombe Regis to Weston Mouth, an isolated shingle beach which can be reached by a footpath. Shortly after you come to the popular village of Branscombe where there's a nice beach and three National Trust properties; The Old Bakery, Manor Mill & Forge. You continue to Beer  passing the photogenic Hooken Cliffs. A slump in the Chalk cliffs in 1790 separated a 10-acre tract of land, now a wooded and sheltered habitat with chalk pinnacles on the seaward side. It's reached via a steep footpath leading from the clifftop to Branscombe Beach. The route finishes in the pretty seaside village of Beer, where there are lovely views over Seaton Bay and Lyme Bay with a nice shingle beach and lots of fishing boats. To extend your walking in the area you can continue along the coast path to Seaton where you can pick up the Lyme Regis to Seaton Undercliff Walk .",
