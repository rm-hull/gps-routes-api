  "description": "This circular walk visits an interesting geological feature near Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. The chimney is located in a secluded area known as the Landslip, located north of Vetnnor in the Bonchurch/Luccombe area. You can start the walk from the Landslip car park where you can directly access the trails. These paths will take you through woodland along a surfaced path to the photogenic chimney. The trail then picks up a section of the Isle of Wight Coast Path to take you to Luccombe village before heading through the countryside to Luccombe Farm. There are nice views over the fields to the coast from this elevated spot.",
