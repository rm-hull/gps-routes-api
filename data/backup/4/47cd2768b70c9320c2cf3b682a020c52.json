  "description": "This walk takes you along a section of the South West Coast Path from the village of Mousehole to the picturesque Lamorna Cove. You then have the option of heading inland to visit Lamorna village. It's about a 3 mile walk on an undulating footpath with views of St Michael's Mount and Mount's Bay to enjoy. The walk starts in Mousehole where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow the waymarked trail south past the pretty harbour. The walk continues past Merlyn Rock, Raginnis, Point Spaniard, Penzer Point, Slinke Dean and Kemyel Point before coming to Lamorna Cove. There's a little pebble beach, a quay and a harbour to enjoy here. At the Quay you can pick up a country lane and follow it north into Lamorna village where there's an interesting old smugglers pub to visit.",
