  "description": "This attractive coastal town is located in the Tendring district of Essex. There's some lovely walking trails along the Colne Estuary to enjoy here. This circular walk takes you along the River Colne before exploring the countryside to the north west of the town. The route runs for just under 7 miles on a series of flat footpaths. There's long waterside sections along the river with plenty of water loving wildlife to look out for on the way. The walk starts from the public car park next to the river at Bateman's Tower. The 19th century tower is located at the entrance to Brightlingsea Creek at Westmarsh Point. Here you'll also find a beach, lined with a number of beach huts. You can then pick up a footpath running north west along the river. There are fine views over Brightlingsea Marsh where you can look out for a wide variety of birdlife. Information boards on the path will tell you all about the marsh and the associated Colne Estuary National Nature Reserve. The trail eventually comes to Alresford Creek then loops back through the countryside before passing through the town. You can then enjoy a stroll along the pretty Brightlingsea Creek before passing the Boating Lake and returning to the car park. At Alresford Creek you have the option of crossing the creek and continuing north to visit the little village of Alresford. There is a train station here if you would like to visit the area by public transport.",
