The track starts as the access road to Le Grys Farm - it turns off Common Road - which serves as a public footpath. Leading past the farm and farm cottage, the now unsurfaced track passes a cattle grid and leads through the northern edge of Wacton Common before turning sharply northwards. It emerges on Flowerpot Lane in Long Stratton."

    "description": "This Norfolk based town is located in a pleasant rural spot halfway between Norwich and Diss. This circular walk from the town takes you south to explore Wacton Common. You can follow a pleasant country lane to the common where you will find grassland, five ponds, boundary ditches, hedgerow and occasional mature trees. It's a pleasant place for a walk with various footpaths to follow and nice views of the surrounding countryside. The return leg follows the Boudicca Way through the countryside to the east of the town. The long distance, waymarked trail is a good way of further exploring the area. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Long Stratton. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
