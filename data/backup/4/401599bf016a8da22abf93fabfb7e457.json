  "description": "Visit these two pretty reservoirs near Sheffield and enjoy a walk through the surrounding woodland on this walk on the edge of the Peak District. The walk starts at the car park at the eastern end of the lower reservoir where there is also a nice picnic area. You then follow the Wyming Brook Drive track through the woodland  to the south of the reservoirs. To extend your walking in the area you could follow the Wyming Brook to the nearby Redmires Reservoir. The brook links the two reservoirs and has a nice walking trail through a nature reserve with lots of interesting flora and fauna. At Redmires you'll find three interestingly shaped reservoirs with a great circular walking trail with woodland paths, climbs across the Peak District Moors and a wide variety of wildfowl and waders to look out for on the water. To continue your walking pick up the delightful Rivelin Valley Nature Trail to the west. The nature trail runs along the side of the rushing river which is surrounded by attractive woodland.",
