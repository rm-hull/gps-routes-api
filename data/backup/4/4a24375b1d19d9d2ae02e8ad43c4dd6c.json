  "description": "This attractive reservoir in the Pentland Hills is a nice place for a stroll. There's footpaths to follow around the southern end of the reservoir with woodland trails in the adjacent Cobbinshaw Forest on the western side of the water. It's a good place for wildlife, with lots of wildfowl to see on the water. The reservoir is located just to the south of Livingston and West Calder. If you'd like to continue your reservoir walking then you could head towards Edinburgh and visit Harlaw Reservoir and Threipmuir Reservoir.  Here you'll find a visitor centre and circular footpath around the reservoir. A few miles to the east you will find Harperrig Reservoir which has a parking area at the western end of the water.",
