  "description": "This attractive reservoir in the Pentland Hills is a nice place for a stroll. There's footpaths to follow around the southern end of the reservoir with woodland trails in the adjacent Cobbinshaw Forest on the western side of the water. It's a good place for wildlife, with lots of wildfowl to see on the water. The reservoir is located just to the south of Livingston and West Calder. If you'd like to continue your reservoir walking then you could head towards Edinburgh and visit Harlaw Reservoir and Threipmuir Reservoir. Here you'll find a visitor centre and circular footpath around the reservoir. A few miles to the east you will find Harperrig Reservoir which has a parking area at the western end of the water.",

      "content": "The lovely Almondell and Calderwood Country Park is located just a few miles to the north east of the reservoir. There's miles of trails through attractive woodland and parkland with views of the River Almond too. To the north there's the pretty Eliburn Reservoir in Eliburn Park on the western side of Livingston. To the east you'll find Harperrig Reservoir. Here you'll find some interesting wildlife including various wildfowl and the Eurasian otter. The site also includes views of the Water of Leith and the 15th century Cairns Castle ruins. At the eastern end of the lake you can pick up the long distance Cross Borders Drove Road. It runs south through the Pentland Hills to West Linton, Peebles, Traquair and then on to Hawick via the Yarrow Valley. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pentland Hills Walks page."
