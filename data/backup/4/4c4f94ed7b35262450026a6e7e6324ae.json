  "description": "This old slate mining town is located in Gwynedd in the Snowdonia National Park. It is a popular visitor destination with attractions including the heritage Ffestiniog Railway and the fascinating Llechwedd Slate Caverns. For walkers there are several good trails to try in the surrounding hills and mountains. This circular walk explores the area to the east of the town. On the trail you'll visit lovely waterfalls and several pretty lakes with fine views over Snowdonia to enjoy from the high points. The walk starts from Bethania, just to the south east of the train station and town centre. From here you can follow footpaths north east to the waterfall. The path continues east to visit Llyn Y Manod, the first of several attractive lakes on the route. You then turn north to pass a series of lakes including Llyn Glas, Llyn Du Bach, Llyn y Drum-boeth, Llyn Bowydd and Llyn Newydd. These last two lakes are somewhat larger than the others and are set in a beautiful, elevated position above the town. They sit on the slopes of Manod Mawr, where you can enjoy wonderful views to Moel Penamnen, the Snowdon massif and the Glyder range of mountains. The path then branches round to the west, towards Moel Bowydd, skirting the edge of the Maen-offeren Quarries. You then descend south to reenter the town.",
