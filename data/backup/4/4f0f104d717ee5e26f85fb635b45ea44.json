  "description": "Explore 1000 acres of woodland and meadows in this beautiful country park in Risca. You can follow the waterside path along the Sirhowy River and climb to Graig Goch Woods for wonderful views of the surrounding countryside. For cyclists National Cycle Route 47 runs through the park. You could pick this up and head west to Parc Penallta . If you're on foot you could extend your walk along the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk or the Sirhowy Valley Ridgeway Walk which run past the park. The circular climb to Machen Mountain also starts from the car park at the park. It uses the waymarked footpaths to climb to the summit where there's a transmitter and excellent views to enjoy.",
