You can pick up a footpath here heading east along the lake with some fine views across the water the surrounding countryside, hills and forestry. At the eastern end there are some woodland trails around Migdale Wood as well. There's also lots of wildlife to see including red kites, buzzards and ravens. To continue your walking in the area head north to visit the splendid Falls of Shin. Here you can look out for the leaping salmon and enjoy a woodland walk through the adjacent Shin Forest.
