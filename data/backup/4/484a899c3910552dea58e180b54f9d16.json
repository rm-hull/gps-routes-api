  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the River Yarrow and through Duxbury Woods on this easy route in Chorley. The pretty woods are located just over a mile south of Chorley town centre. The woods were the location for the 17th century Duxbury Hall, the seat of the Standish family. The estate and grounds still exist with the gardens, stables, coachhouse, 16th century barn and Lodges remaining. There's a car park on the eastern side of the woods, on Duxbury Road. From here you can pick up the waterside trails heading south along the river. Footpaths also branch off to the west to Yarrow Valley Country Park . In the 700 acre park you'll find more riverside trails, a lake and a visitor centre. It's a great place to extend your walk if you have time. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs just to the east of the site. You could pick up the towpath and enjoy a stroll towards Chorley or Adlington. Just to the north you will find the pretty Astley Park which includes the River Chor, woodland, gardens and a beautiful lake. You can visit the canal and the two parks on the Chorley Circular Walk .",
