  "description": "This circular walk climbs to a fine viewpoint and ancient Iron Age Hill fort in Somerset. The walk starts in the village of Pensford where you can pick up the Three Peaks Walk and follow the waymarked trail north west past the impressive Pensford Viaduct. The trail then heads north through the countryside to Norton Malreward before climbing up to Maes Knoll. The hill stands at a height of 197 metres and includes a 20 acre hillfort. From the summit there are great views to east to Bath and the Cotswold Hills, north to Bristol, south over Stanton Drew stone circles to Chew Valley Lake and the Mendip Hills. After taking in the views you head north and then west towards East Dundry where you have the option of climbing Dundry Hill. This route heads south to North Wick and Chew Magna where you cross the River Chew. Here you pick up the Two Rivers Way and follow the path east to Stanton Drew, passing the stone circles on the way. Shortly after you pick up a riverside path taking you back into Pensford.",
