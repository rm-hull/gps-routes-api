  "description": "This walk explores the Tusmore Park Estate, near Bicester in Oxfordshire. The 14th-century park was developed in the 17th century to include formal gardens and avenues around a manor house. The original house was demolished in the 1960s and replaced with a more modern dwelling. You can follow public footpaths through the estate to the little hamlet of Cottisford, to the east. There's some pleasant tree lined avenues and woodland trails to enjoy in the area. Here you'll find pretty streams, an old church and an ancient granary and dovecote. Just to the south you can extend your walk around the ancient woodland in Stoke Wood .",
