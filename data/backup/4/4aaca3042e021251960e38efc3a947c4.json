  "description": "This walk visits the delightful Fairy Glen near the Lancashire village of Parbold. It's a nice easy walk, starting from Parbold train station and heading east along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. You follow the towpath for about a mile before crossing the canal and heading north east to the glen. It's a lovely little spot with pretty streams, beautiful waterfalls, dramatic cliff faces, wooden bridges and shady woodland trails. It's great for flora and fauna with wild garlic, bluebells and various other wildlflowers to see. If you prefer you could start the walk from Appley Bridge station which is just to the east of the site. If you are coming by car you can park at the lay by off the A5209 at the northern end of the glen (postcode WN6 9EQ). From here it is a short walk to the glen on the other side of the road. To extend your walk you can enjoy a climb to the nearby Parbold Hill and enjoy wonderful views over the area. You could also continue south east along the canal to Gathurst, enjoying views of the River Douglas as you go.",
