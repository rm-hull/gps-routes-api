It is situated a short distance to the west of Consett, and to the east of Castleside on the River Derwent.\nFirst recorded as Aleynforth in Bishop Hatfield's survey of c. 1382. The placename is sometimes listed as Allansford, \"At Allansford...is a bridge over the Derwent into Northumberland, surrounded by some of the most beautiful scenery on that stream; there are a few cottages on each side of the river\"."

Part of the inn was built in the late 17th century and may have been a bastle. Later additions continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The inn was licensed until 1869. The upper room in the outbuilding served as a nonconformist chapel."

The River Derwent runs right through the park, with riverside footpaths to follow. The park has picnic tables, a shop and a nature trail in Deneburn Wood. Near the park there's also a picturesque waterfall and old bridge on the Wharnley burn. You can find this just west of the car park. On the northern side of the river there's also the Allensford blast furnace which is part of the local heritage trail and of some industrial archaeological interest.",
