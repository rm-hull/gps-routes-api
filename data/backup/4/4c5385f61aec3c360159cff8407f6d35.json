  "description": "A circular walk exploring Fyfield Down National Nature Reserve in Wiltshire. The area is part of the Marlborough Downs within the North Wessex Downs AONB. There's some lovely views from the elevated ridge and the ancient Grey Wethers to see. The stones are considered the best assemblage of sarsen stones in England. The walk starts from the public car park just north east of the village of Fyfield. From here you can pick up bridleways and follow them up onto Fyfield Down. The area also includes the Wessex Ridgeway which you can follow to the adjacent Clatford and Overton Downs. If you wished to extend the walk then you could head west along the Ridgeway to visit the Avebury Stones. The stone are a major highlight of the area and well worth a visit.",
