  "description": "Take a walk along the Delamere Way and visit Delamere Forest Park and the Trent and Mersey Canal. The path starts in Frodsham and heads south to Delamere Forest with its 2,400 acres of mixed deciduous and evergreen woodland and Blakemere Moss - a lake around 1 km in length. The smaller Hatchmere Lake can also be found in this area. There's a nice waterside pub to visit here. You then turn north towards Acton Bridge before crossing the River Weaver at Dutton Lock and then the Trent & Mersey Canal shorty after. The final section takes you through Hatton and past Appleton Reservoir before finishing at Stockton Heath in Warrington. To extend your walking in the area you could try our Sandstone Trail Circular Walk which uses two long distance trail to create a loop from Frodsham.",
