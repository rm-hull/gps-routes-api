  "description": "Follow the course of the River Wyre from Fleetwood to Abbeystead Reservoir on this 45 mile waymarked walk in Lancashire. It's a lovely long distance trail with great views of the Wyre Estuary at the start and a long stretch through the Forest of Bowland AONB towards the end. The route begins on Shard Bridge near Thornton and Hambleton and heads north to Fleetwood passing the Wyre Estuary Country Park. At Fleetwood you catch the ferry to the pretty village of Knott End before turning south towards Hambleton. Here the path turns east, heading through some lovely countryside to St Michael's on Wyre and Churchtown before coming to the attractive town of Garstang on the Lancaster Canal. The next stage heads north from Garstang to Dolphinholme, passing Scorton Lake and Wyre Lake. At Dolphinholme you head east to Abbeystead where you pass the pretty reservoir before climbing towards Tarnbrook and Marshaw in the Forest of Bowland. The route loops round before finishing back at Abbeystead.",
