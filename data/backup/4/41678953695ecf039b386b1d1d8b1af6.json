  "description": "This is a lovely short climb to the beautiful Hayeswater in the Lake District. The walk starts from the car park in Hartsop, next to the delightful Brothers Water. You then follow a good footpath along the pretty Hayeswater Gill to the reservoir. The reservoir is set in a natural amphitheatre with steep hills on three sides. It's a lovely spot and well worth the sometime steep climb. If you'd like to extend your walk you could head to the nearby Angle Tarn. It's another beautiful spot, located about a mile north west of Hayeswater.",

Here you'll find the appropriately named Brotherswater Inn located just to the south of the lake. The friendly inn does good food which you can enjoy outside with fine views of the surrounding fells. They also provide good quality accommodation if you need to stay over. You can find the pub just south of the lake at postcode CA11 0NZ for your sat navs."
