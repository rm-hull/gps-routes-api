  "description": "This is a lovely short climb to the beautiful Hayeswater in the Lake District. The walk starts from the car park in Hartsop, next to the delightful Brothers Water. You then follow a good footpath along the pretty Hayeswater Gill to the reservoir. The reservoir is set in a natural amphitheatre with steep hills on three sides. It's a lovely spot and well worth the sometime steep climb. If you'd like to extend your walk you could head to the nearby Angle Tarn. It's another beautiful spot, located about a mile north west of Hayeswater.",
