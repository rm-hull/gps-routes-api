There are good moorings here at Brewood, though it is a popular pleasant village with good pubs, so the moorings can be fully used in popular times in the summer. Brewood Bridge (No 14) can be seen ahead. The canal was built by Thomas Telford. He started work in 1826 and the canal opened in 1835, shortly after his death. He attempted to minimise the distance by adopting straight lines wherever possible, so his canal includes many long embankments, and cuttings (as here at Brewood). It was persistent collapse and other construction difficulties at the massive mile long embankment at Shelmore (ten miles north-west of here) that caused the delay."

  "description": "This circular walk from Brewood takes you along a section of the Shropshire Union Canal towards Wheaton Aston before heading through the countryside to visit the pretty Belvide Reservoir and the historic Chillington Hall . The walk starts on the canal on the western side of the town, next to Brewood Bridge. From here you head north passing Shutt Green and Broomhall Bridge. At Lapley Wood Farm you leave the canal to head south west to Belvide Reservoir. You can follow footpaths along the western side of the water which is a great place for birdwatching. The route continues south past Kiddermore Green and Hungary Hill Farm to Chillington Hall. This Georgian country house has some fine walks around the Capability Brown landscaped park and lake. After passing the hall the route picks up the Staffordshire Way and follows it north east back to Dean's Hall Bridge on the canal. From here it is a short waterside stroll back into Brewood.",
