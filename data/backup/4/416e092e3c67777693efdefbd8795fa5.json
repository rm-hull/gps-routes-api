However there are large earth embankments on either side of the river here to constrain any high water levels."

It crossed the brooks by means of a causeway some of which still exists."

  "description": "This large village is located on the northern edge of the South Downs in the Horsham district of West Sussex. Near the village there's nice riverside walks along the River Arun, some pretty nature reserves and large woodland areas. This circular walk from the village visits the Pulborough Brooks Nature Reserve to the south of the village. Start the walk from the car park at the southern edge of the village. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south to the RSPB reserve where you'll find wetlands and nature trails. Look out for wildlife including Peregrine Falcon, Lapwing and Wigeon as you maked your way around the site. There's also some good views across the South Downs to enjoy from the paths. Follow the footpaths south and they will take you towards Wiggonholt. There's the option here of taking a detour south to visit Wiggonholt Common where there are some nice woodland trails. This walk heads north past Lickfold towards Marehill, before heading through the village to return to the car park.",

      "content": "The nature reserve includes its own RSPB cafe where you can stop for refreshments on the walk. In the village there's some good pubs including The White Horse on Mare Hill Road. They do good food and also have a fine terraced garden for warmer weather. It's a lovely place to sit out and enjoy views across the Brooks. You can find the pub at a postcode of RH20 2DY for your sat navs."

      "subtitle": "Dog Walking",
      "content": "The public footpaths around the reserve are good for dog walking. You cannot take your dog on the Wetland trail though. There's also some nice woodland trails through Northpark Wood on Wiggonholt Common. The RSPB cafe mentioned above is dog friendly with dogs allowed onto the tea terrace adjacent to the cafe."

      "content": "The Wey South Path can be picked up on the western side of the village. This waymarked, long distance footpath will take you south along the river Arun towards Amberley and the lovely Amberley Wild Brooks Nature Reserve. You'll also pass the village of Coldwaltham and the little nature reserve of Waltham Brooks on the path. Head south east from the town and you will soon come to the neighbouring town of Storrington. The picturesque little town has a pretty mill pond and good access to the South Downs which is located just to the south. The circular Storrington Walk takes you onto the downs, climbing to Kithurst Hill where there's fine views to the coast from the summit. Rackham Woods can be found just to south. The circular route also visits the viewpoint at Rackham Hill and the fascinating Iron Age Urnfields containing the cremated remains of prehistory people in clay pots.  For more walking ideas in the area see the South Downs Walks page."
