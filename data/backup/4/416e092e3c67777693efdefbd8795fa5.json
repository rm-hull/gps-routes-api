It crossed the brooks by means of a causeway some of which still exists."

  "description": "This large village is located on the northern edge of the South Downs in the Horsham\u00a0district of\u00a0West Sussex. Near the village there's nice riverside walks along the River Arun, some pretty nature reserves and large woodland areas. This circular walk from the village visits the Pulborough Brooks Nature Reserve to the south of the village. Start the walk from the car park at the southern edge of the village. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south to the RSPB reserve where you'll find wetlands and nature trails. Look out for wildlife including Peregrine Falcon, Lapwing and Wigeon as you maked your way around the site. There's also some good views across the South Downs to enjoy from the paths. Follow the footpaths south and they will take you towards Wiggonholt. There's the option here of taking a detour south to visit Wiggonholt Common where there are some nice woodland trails. This walk heads north past Lickfold towards Marehill, before heading through the village to return to the car park.",
