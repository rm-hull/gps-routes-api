  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Pule Hill on the wonderful Marsden Moor Estate in the South Pennines. The route runs for about 5 miles with a fairly challenging climb on the way. Start the walk from Marsden train station and then pick up footpaths heading west along the canal towards the Standedge Tunnels. Here you can pick up a section of the Standedge Trail and follow it south, crossing the route of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal as you go. From the high points there are some splendid views across the Pennines and down to Redbrook Reservoir below. You continue round to the east and north along the trail before coming to Netherley where you can visit Butterley Reservoir. The route then picks up the Kirklees Way and follows the waymarked trail back to the train station.",

On the ground floor in the bar, there are 10 real ale hand pumps several of which are permanently dedicated to the popular Riverhead beers brewed on-site. The famous Riverhead micro-brewery is housed downstairs in the cellar. Here they brew a wide range of beers all with a local connection. Hot and cold food is served regularly with all dishes freshly prepared on site. You can find the pub in the picturesque village, next to the River Colne, on Peel Street with a postcode of HD7 6BR for your sat navs."
