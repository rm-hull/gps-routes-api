  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Pule Hill on the wonderful Marsden Moor Estate in the South Pennines. The route runs for about 5 miles with a fairly challenging climb on the way. Start the walk from Marsden train station and then pick up footpaths heading west along the canal towards the Standedge Tunnels. Here you can pick up a section of the Standedge Trail and follow it south, crossing the route of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal as you go. From the high points there are some splendid views across the Pennines and down to Redbrook Reservoir below. You continue round to the east and north along the trail before coming to Netherley where you can visit Butterley Reservoir. The route then picks up the Kirklees Way and follows the waymarked trail back to the train station.",
