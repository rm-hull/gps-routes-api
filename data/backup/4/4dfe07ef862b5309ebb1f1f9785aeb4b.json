    "description": "Mill Hill village is located in the London Borough of Barnet in Greater London. The pretty village is a nice place to start a walk with a village green, picturesque pond, Georgian properties and plenty of Green Belt countryside to explore. It's accessible on the London Underground on the Northern Line in Travelcard Zone 4. Local highlights include the waterside Dollis Valley Green Walk which can be picked up at the Scratchwood and Moat Mount Open Space just to the north. This walk explores the Arrandene Open Space and Featherstone Hill Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation. The area is located right next to the village and includes some pleasant footpaths around the ancient hedgerows and old hay meadows. There's some interesting flora and fauna with birds including spotted flycatcher, lesser whitethroat, reed bunting and skylark to look out for.",
