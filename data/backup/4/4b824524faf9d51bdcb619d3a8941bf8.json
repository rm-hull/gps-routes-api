  "description": "A walk along the Little Ouse River from Thetford to Santon Downham in Thetford Forest. The route starts next to the bridge in Thetford where you can pick up the Little Ouse Path. Follow the waymarked trail north west and it will take you past Thetford Priory and into the woods. The path then bends round to the west to come to Santon Downham. After exploring the little village the route turns around to head east on other woodland trails through the forest before rejoining the river. The walk can be extended by continuing west to visit Brandon Country Park .",

      "content": "In Santon Downham you could pay a visit to the noteworthy Santon Downham Church. Dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, parts of this church date back to the 12th century, although the tower was built in the 15th century. There is a brick high up on the north side of the tower which is said to mark the height reached by sand during the great sandstorm of 1668. Just north of Santon Downham you can pick up the Grime's Graves and Weeting Castle Walk. This route visits two interesting English Heritage run historical sites in the area. The first is a prehistoric flint mine dug over 5000 years ago where you can descend on a ladder to view the fascinating pit. The route then visits nearby Weeting Castle where you'll find the ruins of a 12th century manor house. Both sites are well run with information boards detailing the history of the area. For more local history head east of the town to pick up the West Harling Circular Walk. Here you'll find an interesting deserted medieval village with a noteworthy 13th century church. A few miles to the north west there's another major local highlight at the Lynford Arboretum. It's a lovely place for a walk with woodland trails, pretty lakes and an impressive 19th century Sequoia Avenue to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Walks page."
