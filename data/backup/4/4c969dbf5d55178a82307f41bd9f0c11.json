  "description": "This historic Cumbrian village is located in a lovely spot in the Lower Eden Valley, just south of Armathwaite and north of Penrith. It's a fine place for a stroll with several ancient buildings and views of the pretty Raven Beck which runs through the village. Highlights include St Oswald's church which dates back to the 12th century and the College, a former Pele tower built in 1450. There's also an excellent local pub to relax in after your exercise. This walk takes you through the village and then follows a country lane south to visit neighbouring Lazonby. On the way you will cross Eden Bridge where you can enjoy some lovely views down the River Eden. In Lazonby you will find the Lazonby & Kirkoswald railway station on the Settle-Carlisle Line. You could catch the wonderful heritage train to a major local highlight at Ribblehead Viaduct. The impressive viaduct carries the Settle-Carlisle Railway across Batty Moss in the valley of the River Ribble at Ribblehead, in North Yorkshire.",
