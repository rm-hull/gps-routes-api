  "description": "This circular walk explores the Steart Marshes area of the Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve on the Somerset coast. The area is a great for wildlife watching with otters, egrets, owls waders and a variety of wildfowl to look out for on the River Parrett Estuary. You can start the walk from the reserve car park where you can pick up a section of the River Parret Trail. Follow the waymarked trail south through the marshes before picking up an alternative country lane to the west. You can extend the walk by heading north east to visit Stert Point where there are lovely views across the Stert Flats. The Stert Drove runs through the Marsh. This minor road is good for both cycling and walking through the area.",
