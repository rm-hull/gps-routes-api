  "description": "Enjoy a walk around this interesting and beautiful Nature Reserve in the South Downs, near Chichester. There are well defined paths with fabulous views over the South Downs towards the south coast. The reserve also contains one of the finest yew forests in Europe, including a grove of ancient trees which are among the oldest living things in Britain. If you have time you could continue your walk west along the Monarch's Way to Stoughton where you can buy refreshments at the local pub. Near you will find Stansted Park where you will find a fine 1800 acre park surrounding the Edwardian Stansted House. It's a great place to extend your walk with nice trails to follow around the park and through the adjacent Stansted Forest.",

There's a charming interior with a number of decorative items including a striking metre-high bronze horse and jockey sculpture in the entrance hall, an 1840 chestnut serving table from the mountainous area of Andalusia in southern Spain, and an apple green baker\u2019s counter bar that was bought from the Cognac region of France. They serve good quality food in the dining room which includes a number of early 20th century paintings and contemporary art. Outside there's also a lovely garden area for warmer days. You can find them at postcode PO18 9AX for your sat navs."

      "content": "Head south east from the site and you will soon come to the delightful town of Chichester. Here you can pick up the Chichester Canal Walk and the Chichester Harbour Walk. Just to the east of the site you could pick up the Centurion Way. This easy shared cycling and walking trail runs along the old Midhurst and Chichester railway to Chichester via the River Lavant Valley. Head north and you could visit a splendid viewpoint at Harting Down. There's also the nearby village of South Harting where you could pay a visit to the National Trust's Uppark. Here you'll find a fine 17th century Georgian House surrounded by lovely gardens with views of the English Channel. The author H.G Wells stayed in the house during the late 19th century. The class divisions he observed here inspired his socialist views which later manifested themselves in work such as 'The Time Machine'. You can find the house at postcode GU31 5QR. For more walking ideas in the area see the South Downs Walks page."
