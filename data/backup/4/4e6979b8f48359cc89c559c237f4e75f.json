  "description": "Enjoy a walk around this interesting and beautiful Nature Reserve in the South Downs, near Chichester. There are well defined paths with fabulous views over the South Downs towards the south coast. The reserve also contains one of the finest yew forests in Europe, including a grove of ancient trees which are among the oldest living things in Britain. If you have time you could continue your walk west along the Monarch's Way to Stoughton where you can buy refreshments at the local pub. Near you will find Stansted Park where you will find a fine 1800 acre park surrounding the Edwardian Stansted House. It's a great place to extend your walk with nice trails to follow around the park and through the adjacent Stansted Forest.",
