  "description": "This route uses a section of the Viking Way and the Water Rail Way to create a circular walk around the Lincolnshire Wolds town of Woodhall Spa. On the route there's some lovely fenland scenery and waterside walking along the River Witham to enjoy. The walk starts in the town and follows the trail west and then north to the village of Stixwould. You continue north east along Duckpool Lane before turning west to visit Southrey. Here you pick up the Water Rail Way, a shared cycling and walking trail running along a dismantled railway line. The trail willl take you south east along the river to Woodhall Spa.",
