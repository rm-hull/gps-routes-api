  "description": "Follow the Slemish Path to the 1437 ft summit of this mountain in County Antrim. The challenging path starts from the Carnstroan Lane car park near Broughshane and climbs steeply to the summit. Here you are rewarded with fine views over Antrim, the Scottish coast, Ballymena town, Lough Neagh and the Sperrin Mountains. The area is great for wildlife with large black ravens, buzzards, wheatears and meadow pipits to look out for on the walk.",
