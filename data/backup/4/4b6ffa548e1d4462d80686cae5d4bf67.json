The challenging path starts from the Carnstroan Lane car park near Broughshane and climbs steeply to the summit. Here you are rewarded with fine views over Antrim, the Scottish coast, Ballymena town, Lough Neagh and the Sperrin Mountains. The area is great for wildlife with large black ravens, buzzards, wheatears and meadow pipits to look out for on the walk.",

They do a fine Sunday lunch and serve an excellent pint of Guinness which you can enjoy in front of the roaring fire. The 18th century pub includes many of its original features, including its stone build exterior, slate flooring & thatched roof, together with two roaring open fires. You can find them at 57 Main St, Broughshane, Ballymena BT42 4JP."

There's 191 hectares to explore with woodland trails, a maze, a beautiful sculptured walled garden and a wonderful coastline. The epic Gobbins Cliff Path and the Blackhead Lighthouse are further south along the coast and well worth a visit. A few miles to the north there's miles of woodland trails to enjoy in the expansive Glenariff Forest Park and Ballypatrick Forest. To the west there's the popular Portglenone Fisherman's Walk which will take you along a lovely section of the River Bann. In this area there's also the pretty Portglenone Forest with its spring bluebells and attractive memorial garden. To the east there's Glenarm where you can visit the historic Glenarm Castle and enjoy a walk around their beautiful grounds and gardens. Near here there's more fine coastal views and an ancient ruined church in Cushendall."
