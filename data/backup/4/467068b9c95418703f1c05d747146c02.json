  "description": "Enjoy a short walk around the estate surrounding this Grade 1 listed Tudor/Stuart mansion near Helston in Cornwall. The estate has nice public footpaths running from the house to the nearby Godolphin Hill. You can climb the hill and enjoy super views of the surrounding Cornish countryside. On a clear day you can also see the coast and St Michael's Mount. On top of the hill you will find gorse, wildflowers and possibly grazing ponies in the summer. The house also has a number of pretty gardens to explore including a sixteenth century walled privy garden and an orchard. To continue your walking in the area head a mile to the south and you could enjoy a climb to Tregonning Hill for more great views over the area.",
