Opened in 1884 by the Great North of Scotland Railway on the line from Tillynaught to Tochieneal, extended 2 years later to Elgin, this through station replaced an earlier 1859 terminus some 200m to the north. In turn, this station closed in 1968. View south east along the former platform towards Tillynaught and ultimately, Aberdeen. A second platform for westbound trains had existed to the right of the image. The station building was in use as a scout hut when this image was taken."

Here you will find a park which includes the old railway station and a small lake. You can follow waterside footpaths along the lake before heading north to return to the harbour. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Portsoy To Cullen Coastal Walk which will take you along a splendid cliff top path to Cullen, via the photogenic ruins of the ancient Findlater Castle .",
