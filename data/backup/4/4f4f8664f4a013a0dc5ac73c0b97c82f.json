  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the lovely Rest Bay in Porthcawl. There's a lovely beach here and great views over the bay to the Bristol Channel and the coast of North Devon. You can start the walk from the Rest Bay car park on the western side of Porthcawl. Then pick up the coastal footpaths heading north to Sker Point. Near here you could take a detour to visit the nearby Kenfig Pool Nature Reserve where there's lots of wildlife to see. This route heads north east past Sker House towards Parc Newydd Farm. Here you can pick up Moor Lane and follow the pleasant country lane south east before turning west to pass through Porthcawl.",
