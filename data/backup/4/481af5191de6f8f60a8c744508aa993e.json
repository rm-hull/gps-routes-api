  "description": "Enjoy an exhilarating coastal walk on this short route from Cayton Bay to Scarborough. The route runs for about 3 miles along a wonderful cliff top path with great coastal views for the duration. The walk starts from the car park at the beautiful Cayton Bay just south of Scarborough. The bay is one of a series of large sweeping sandy bays on the edge of the North Yorkshire National Park which run from Bridlington in the south to Whitby in the north. The area is managed by the National Trust and includes a beautiful surfing beach and a woodland section along Cayton Cliff. There is a surf shop and car park on the cliff tops above the bay. From here you can pick up the Cleveland Way National Trail and follow it north to Frank Cliff and Wheatcroft Cliff, passing the golf course on your left. You then come into Scarborough, passing the pretty South Cliff Gardens and South Bay, before finishing on the beach at St Nicholas Cliff. To extend your walking in the area try the Scarborough to Filey Walk. You could also visit Peasholm Park where there's tree lined paths, a pretty lake and gardens with an oriental theme.",
