  "description": "This lovely walk in Eskdale takes you to Stanley Ghyll Force Waterfall. There is a small car parking area just to the north of the falls where you can start the walk. You could also start from the Dalegarth for Boot railway station on the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway. You can catch the great old steam train from Ravenglass and then head south to the falls. The trail runs for about half a mile along the River Esk through a narrow gorge with attractive woodland and rhododendrons. The 60 foot high falls are an impressive sight and one of the hidden gems of the Lake District. If you'd like to extend your walking in Eskdale then you could head to the nearby Blea Tarn . The pretty tarn is located just over a mile to the north of the falls. There are also nice trails along the River Esk running east or west from the train station. Just over a mile south of the falls you will find the pretty Devoke Water . It is the largest tarn in the Lake District and has a nice footpath running along its southern edge.",
