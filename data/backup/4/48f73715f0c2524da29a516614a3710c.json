  "description": "This lovely walk in Eskdale takes you to Stanley Ghyll Force Waterfall. There is a small car parking area just to the north of the falls where you can start the walk. You could also start from the Dalegarth for Boot railway station on the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway. You can catch the great old steam train from Ravenglass and then head south to the falls. The trail runs for about half a mile along the River Esk through a narrow gorge with attractive woodland and rhododendrons. The 60 foot high falls are an impressive sight and one of the hidden gems of the Lake District. If you'd like to extend your walking in Eskdale then you could head to the nearby Blea Tarn. The pretty tarn is located just over a mile to the north of the falls. There are also nice trails along the River Esk running east or west from the train station. Just over a mile south of the falls you will find the pretty Devoke Water. It is the largest tarn in the Lake District and has a nice footpath running along its southern edge.",

      "content": "Just to the east of the falls you will find the noteworthy Woolpack Inn which is a fine place to go for some refreshments after your walk. The inn also contains the Hardknott Cafe. It's located at the top of one of England\u2019s most dramatic valleys, and the bottom of one of its most exciting roads \u2013 the Hardknott Pass. The inn has a good menu with cosy fires indoors to warm yourself next to. There's also a nice outdoor area for the summer and it is dog friendly too. You can find the pub on the pass at a postcode of CA19 1TH for your sat navs. Just to the west is the worthy village of Eskdale Green. The pretty settlement includes a tarn, woods, a Japanese Garden, riverside trails and two fine historic pubs. There's also Eskdale Green station or Irton Road Station on the heritage Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway here. Just north of the village there's the climb to Irton Pike. There's some excellent views to Wast Water from this fine viewpoint."
