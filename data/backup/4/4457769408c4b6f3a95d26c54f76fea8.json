  "description": "Enjoy a short, waterside stroll along the Ripon Canal, on this easy walk in North Yorkshire. The canal runs for just over two miles, from the cathedral city of Ripon, to the River Ure, near Newby Hall . Along the way there are pretty locks and nice views of the surrounding countryside. At the end of the canal you will find the wonderful Newby Hall. The 18th century house is open to the public from 21 March until 1 October. It's a lovely spot with the grounds including views over the River Ure, extensive herbaceous borders and woodland walks. The canal forms part of the long distance Ripon Rowel which takes you on a tour of the countryside and villages surrounding the city. You can continue along the trail to extend your walk. Just to the west of the canal is the splendid Studley Park and Fountains Abbey where there are miles of footpaths taking you around beautiful parkland and gardens. Our Boroughbridge Canal Walk will take you along a lovely section of the River Ure which links with the canal around Newby Hall.",
