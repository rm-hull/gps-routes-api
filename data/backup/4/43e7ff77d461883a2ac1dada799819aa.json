  "description": "Enjoy several cycling and walking trails in this forest near Corby and Peterborough. Mountain bikers can have a go on the Scar Tree Trail. This blue graded, single-track ride is three miles in length and starts at the car park. Walkers can enjoy the 2 mile Deer Park Trail where you will pass two Bronze age burial cairns and hopefully spot a few of the deer that roam through the forest. The route below is designed for walkers and starts at the car park, taking you through the forest on various trails. Cyclists should please stick to the Scar Tree Trail which you can also pick up at the car park. If you would like to continue your outing you could head a couple of miles east to Fineshade Woods where you'll find more cycling and walking trails. Fineshade and Wakerley Woods are part of the larger Rockingham Forest which can be explored on the Jurassic Way long distance trail.",
