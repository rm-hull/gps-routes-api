  "description": "This walk takes you to two of the highlights near to the little village of Uffculme near the Blackdown Hills area of Devon. On the route you will visit the historic Coldharbour Mill and the lovely Bridwell Park country Estate. The final section returns to the village on a nice riverside path next to the River Culm, which flows just to the east of the settlement. Bridwell is home to\u00a0Lord Ivar Mountbatten and was opened to the public in 2020. The estate includes pleasant footpaths taking you through the parkland with its wide green lawns and resident deer. Just east of the park there's also Coldharbour Mill . The mill dates back to 1797 and is\u00a0one of the oldest woollen mills in the country. There's a working wool museum\u00a0where you can see crafts men and women making traditional textiles, beautiful knitting yarn and hand woven rugs.",
