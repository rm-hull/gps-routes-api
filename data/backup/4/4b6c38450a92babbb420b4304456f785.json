  "description": "This walk takes you to two of the highlights near to the little village of Uffculme near the Blackdown Hills area of Devon. On the route you will visit the historic Coldharbour Mill and the lovely Bridwell Park country Estate. The final section returns to the village on a nice riverside path next to the River Culm, which flows just to the east of the settlement. Bridwell is home to Lord Ivar Mountbatten and was opened to the public in 2020. The estate includes pleasant footpaths taking you through the parkland with its wide green lawns and resident deer. Just east of the park there's also Coldharbour Mill. The mill dates back to 1797 and is one of the oldest woollen mills in the country. There's a working wool museum where you can see crafts men and women making traditional textiles, beautiful knitting yarn and hand woven rugs.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Wellington Monument or Culmstock Beacon for some wonderful views over the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. To the east there's Hemyock which is notable as the largest village in the Blackdown Hills AONB. It also includes an ancient ruined castle and views of the River Culm so is worthy of some investigation."
