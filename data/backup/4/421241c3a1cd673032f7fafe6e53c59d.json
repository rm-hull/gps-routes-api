  "description": "A circular walk from Henley visiting Stonor, Middle Assendon and the National Trust's Greys Court. The route runs for just over 12 miles with some fine woodland and country trails. The walk starts in Henley-on-Thames where you can pick up the Oxfordshire Way in the town centre. Follow the wayamrked trail north and it will take you through Henley Park to the village of Middle Assendon. From here you head north to Paradise Wood and Almshill Wood before coming to Stonor. You'll pass the splendid Stonor Park in this area. The park has been the Stonor family's residence for 850 years making it one of the oldest family homes still lived in today. There's wonderful gardens and parkland with resident deer to see here. Head west from here and it will take you past Park Wood and Maidensgrove where you turn south along the Oxfordshire Way to Bix Common. Just south of Bix you can take a small detour to visit Greys Court. There's a 16th-century mansion, a 14th century tower and tranquil gardens to visit here. After exploring the house the route heads north east through Lambridge Wood before turning south east to return to Henley.",

It's located in a great spot next to the river and has a nice outdoor terrace with fine views. Inside there's a charming interior with original beams and a cosy fireplace. The pub also has an interesting history dating back to 1728. With its fine architecture and riverside location it's one of the most photographed and painted pubs in England. You can find the pub at postcode RG9 1BH for your sat navs. You could also stop off on the route at Greys Court where there's a lovely National Trust tea room."

      "content": "The country and woodland trails on the walk are ideal for you and your dog. The Angel on the Bridge mentioned above is also dog friendly. Dogs are welcome at the National Trust's Greys Court but they do need to be kept under close control on the estate, particularly around farm animals. To protect the plants dogs are not permitted in the walled gardens area though."

      "content": "Around Stonor you can link up with the Chiltern Way. You could follow it north east through the deer park to Turville and the famous Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Windmill. Heading west will take you towards Nuffield and Ewelme where you can visit the lovely Ewelme Watercress Beds Local Nature Reserve. The circular Nettlebed Walk starts from the nearby village. It explores a similar area, visiting the Warburg Nature Reserve on the way. Near here is the worthy village of Stoke Row where there are some interesting historical features. The pretty village includes the distinctive Maharajah's Well, a pretty cherry orchard and a noteworthy 17th century pub reputed to be the former haunt of notorious highwayman Dick Turpin. For more walking ideas in the area see the Chilterns Walks page."
