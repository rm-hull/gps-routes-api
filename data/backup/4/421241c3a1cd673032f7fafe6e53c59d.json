  "description": "A circular walk from Henley visiting Stonor, Middle Assendon and the National Trust's Greys Court. The route runs for just over 12 miles with some fine woodland and country trails. The walk starts in Henley-on-Thames where you can pick up the Oxfordshire Way in the town centre. Follow the wayamrked trail north and it will take you through Henley Park to the village of Middle Assendon. From here you head north to Paradise Wood and Almshill Wood before coming to Stonor. You'll pass the splendid Stonor Park in this area. The park has been the Stonor family's residence for 850 years making it one of the oldest family homes still lived in today. There's wonderful gardens and parkland with resident deer to see here. Head west from here and it will take you past Park Wood and Maidensgrove where you turn south along the Oxfordshire Way to Bix Common. Just south of Bix you can take a small detour to visit Greys Court . There's a 16th-century mansion, a 14th century tower and tranquil gardens to visit here. After exploring the house the route heads north east through Lambridge Wood before turning south east to return to Henley.",
