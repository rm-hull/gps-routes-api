  "description": "This circular walk visits the Belas Knap neolithic, chambered long barrow, on Cleeve Hill. The fascinating scheduled ancient monument dates from around 3000 BC and includes a false entrance and independently accessible side chambers. Excavations in 1963 found the remains of 38 human skeletons, animal bones, flint implements and pottery dating from the Neolithic period (New Stone Age), circa 2000 BC. Start the walk from the car park on Corndean Road just to the north of the site. From here it's a short climb along a section of the Cotswold Way to the long barrow. You can explore the fascinating English Heritage site where there are also fine views over the surrounding Cotswolds countryside. The walk then continues west along the Cotswold Way to Wontley Farm and Cleeve Common. Follow the route round past Postlip Warren to the Royal Naval Air Station Merryfield. You pass the River Isbourne and the Postlip Hall Tithe Barn, before picking up a country lane to take you to Corndean Hall and the car park. This site is situated just to the east of Cleeve Common and Cleeve Hill, the highest point both of the Cotswolds and Gloucestershire. It's a great place to extend your walk with more fine views to enjoy. Just a mile to the north east from the car park you will find Sudeley Castle. There's a wonderful 1,200 acre estate surrounding the 15th century castle with lots of nice footpaths to try. The Winchcombe Way long distance trail and our Winchcombe Circular Walk also passes the site.",
