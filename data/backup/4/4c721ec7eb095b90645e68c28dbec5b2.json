  "description": "Explore the Beckford Nature Reserve on this easy walk in the Worcestershire village of Beckford. The reserve lies just north of the village and includes a pleasant path around a lake. There's lots of wildlife to see including greylag goose and wigeon. There's also some peaceful woodland paths with pretty bluebells in the spring. After exploring the reserve head south to enjoy a stroll around the pretty village where there's a Georgian House and a fine old church. To continue your walking in the area head north to climb to the popular viewpoint on Bredon Hill. There are some fabulous views over the Cotswolds from this splendid vantage point.",

It's a very attractive place with carefully manicured lawns, charming benches and the sound of trickling water from the small pond. They serve a good range of sandwiches with locally sourced ingredients. You can find them on the Main Street at postcode GL20 7AD."
