  "description": "This circular walk explores the wonderful Fourteen Locks on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal. The impressive flight of locks date from the 18th century and are a popular destination for walkers. The walk starts from the Fourteen Locks centre where there is a car park. It's located next to the pound below the top lock and includes exhibits about the canal, changing displays of local art, a meeting room and a tea room. They also organise guided walks from here. From here you can pick up footpaths heading east along the canal with embanked ponds, pounds, sluices and weirs. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the on site tea rooms. Our Newport Canal Walk is a longer walk, starting in the city centre and taking you all the way to the lock flight, if you prefer to start from there. The Sirhowy Valley Ridgeway Walk also runs past the locks so you could extend your walk by picking up this waymarked trail. If you follow it south for about 2 miles it will lead you to Tredegar House Country Park where you'll find a 17th-century mansion surrounded by 90 acres of beautiful gardens and parkland.",
