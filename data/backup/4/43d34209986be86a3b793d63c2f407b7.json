Pre-war OS maps show a toll gate at this point which implies that there has always been an expectation of its use for general passage. There certainly doesn't seem to be much restriction on its use, although realistically it doesn't provide a better route than using the main A52."

  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk or cycle in this splendid 270 acre country park in Nottingham. The park includes several large lakes and the delightful Skylark Nature Reserve. You can hire a bike or just go for a stroll along the lovely, lakeside paths. The River Trent also runs through the park  so there is scope for continuing your walk along the Trent Valley Way walking route. Adjacent to Holme Pierrpont is Colwick Country Park which is another option for extending your outing. You could also head to Broxtowe Country Park where there's some nice woodland trails and a BMX track to try. The park is the home of the National Watersports Centre so you could have a go at kayaking or windsurfing. Holme Pierrepont is located just to the south of Nottingham city centre.",
