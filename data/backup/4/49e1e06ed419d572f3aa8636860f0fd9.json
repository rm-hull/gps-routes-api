  "description": "This is a nice easy walk around the lovely Blea Tarn near Eltwerwater in the Lake District National Park. There are terrific views of Lingmoor, Pike of Blisco and the other surrounding Langdale fells. The tarn is very picturesque and popular with photographers. Langdale Pikes make a splendid backdrop, while the shores are lined with beautiful alpine flowers in the spring and summer. This route starts at the National Trust car park near the tarn (postcode:LA22 9PG) and follows well surfaced paths around the water and through peaceful woodland before a short, steady climb to the high point of the route giving great views of the\u00a0Little Langdale Valley and the Coniston Fells. You could also start the walk from the Beckfoot rail station on the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway. You can catch the classic steam train from Ravenglass to Eskdale and then start the short climb to the tarn from the station. If you'd like to extend your walking in beautiful Eskdale you could head a mile or so south to the lovely Stanley Ghyll Force . The waterfall drops 60 feet into a narrow gorge with attractive woodland and views of the River Esk to enjoy also.",
