  "description": "This walk takes you from Pembridge to the neighbouring village of Eardisland. They are both picture postcard English villages located on the River Arrow. The walk starts in the public car park in Pembridge. Highlights in the village include the Duppa's Almshouses in Bridge Street, founded in 1661. There's also the old church which includes a 13th century chancel. Near the car park you can pick up a public footpath heading west along the River Arrow to Eardisland. It's about a 2 mile walk, passing weirs and waterfalls on the way. Eardisland is very pretty with the an old stone bridge over the river which runs past the little cottages in the village.",
