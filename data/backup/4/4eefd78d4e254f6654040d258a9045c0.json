  "description": "This walk takes you from Pembridge to the neighbouring village of Eardisland. They are both picture postcard English villages located on the River Arrow. The walk starts in the public car park in Pembridge. Highlights in the village include the Duppa's Almshouses in Bridge Street, founded in 1661. There's also the old church which includes a 13th century chancel. Near the car park you can pick up a public footpath heading west along the River Arrow to Eardisland. It's about a 2 mile walk, passing weirs and waterfalls on the way. Eardisland is very pretty with the an old stone bridge over the river which runs past the little cottages in the village.",

      "content": "The villages are on the splendid Black and White Village Trail. This long distance footpath explores several of the towns and villages of the county. It's named after the wonderful old timber framed buildings which are typical of the area. If you follow the trail east it will take you into Leominster. Heading east will take you to the market town of Kington, near the border with Wales. Head north and you can try the circular Shobdon Walk. The route takes you around the neighbouring village visiting Shobdon Park, the Shobdon Court Estate and the pretty Pearl Lake which is the largest natural body of water in Herefordshire. There's also a fine 18th century pub to visit on the way. Just to the north of Shobdon you can also pick up the Mortimer Trail. This long distance waymarked trail can be followed to Shobdon Hill Wood and the interesting hill fort Croft Ambrey. From the elevated position of the trail you can enjoy fine views over the Wye Valley. You can also explore the beautiful gardens surrounding the historic Croft Castle here. The village is also located near to the town of Leominster where you can enjoy riverside trails along the River Lugg on the Leominster Walk. A few miles to the south there's the delightful village of Weobley where you can see the historic Norman church, several photogenic medieval dwellings and The Ley, a Grade-I listed farmhouse dating to 1589.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Herefordshire Walks page."
