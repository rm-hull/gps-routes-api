  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll around this pretty lake in the Forest of Dean. There's a well surfaced trail running around the lake which is suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs. There's also a car park at the southern end of the lake and a nice picnic area. Trails head off into the surrounding woodland towards Staple-Edge Wood and Blakeney Walk Woods. The Forest of Dean Family Route passes the lake so you could pick this up to extend your exercise. Heading west will take you to the RSPB's wildlife rich Nagshead Nature Reserve and the delightful Cannop Ponds. Just north of there you will find the splendid Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail. The area is also popular with mountain bikers with a series of downhill MTB trails suitable for abilities. These include technical down hill lines, fast flow jump lines and steep sections. There's also a Family Cycle Trail, just along the link path after the Go Ape Cabin.",
