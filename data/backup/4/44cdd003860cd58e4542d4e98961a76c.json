  "description": "This small village near the city of Durham has some peaceful local woods and riverside trails to try. The historic village is one of the most affluent in the county and has been designated a conservation area. Features include a mediaeval bridge over the river and the 18th century Shincliffe Hall in the wood. This circular walk from the town visits Shincliffe Wood and the River Wear before heading to Croxdale Wood, Croxdale Hall and Sunderland bridge. It's a lovely area with lots of peaceful woodland trails, lakes, ponds and fine views of the river and surrounding countryside. The walk starts in the village and then heads north west towards Shincliffe Bridge where you can pick up the Weardale Way. Follow the waymarked path south and it will take you to the riverside Shincliffe Wood. You continue towards Butterby Wood and Croxdale Wood before passing Croxdale Hall and Sunderland Bridge. You then head east past Annie's Wood lake before following the Strawberry Lane Bridle path north back to the village.",

Near here there's also Houghall Woods where there's lots of pretty bluebells in the spring months.
