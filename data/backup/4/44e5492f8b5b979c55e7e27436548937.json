Records show that this work cost a total of \u00a38426, 4 shillings and 6 pence halfpenny. Only the tower remained in its original position. This work seems to have been done in a sensitive manner as the church doesn't exhibit the usual results of Victorian restoration and improvement."

Two carved heads on its front represent the heads of\u00a0Noah\u00a0and his wife, hence its name. The Ark has been a meeting place, a post office, an inn, a butcher's shop, a private house and a museum; it is currently the Town Council offices."

  "description": "This walk visits the impressive Tadcaster Viaduct across the\u00a0River Wharfe in the Yorkshire town of Tadchester. The viaduct was constructed as part of the northern section of the Leeds-York Line. It consists of 11 arches, 7 west of the river, 2 east of the river, and 2 wider arches across the\u00a0River Wharfe. Start the walk from the Bridge Street Bridge and follow Wharfe Bank Terrace along the river to the viaduct. You can then climb up to the viaduct where there is a footpath running along the top. There's nice views over the town and the river from the elevated position of the viaduct. The interesting market town has other historical sites to visit after your walk. The oldest building in active use in the town is 'The Ark', built in the late-15th century. There's also Tadcaster Bridge built in 1700 which connects two parts of the town centre. To continue your walking around Tadcaster you could head south and try the Towton Battlefield Walk . The historical walk explores the site of the Battle of Towton\u00a0which was fought on 29 March 1461 near the village of Towton. The Jorvic Way and the Ebor Way also pass through the town. You can pick up these trails to explore the countryside surrounding the town. Heading north east on the Ebory Way will take you through the countryside to Copmanthorpe. There's also nice riverside footpaths heading south east from Tadcaster to the nearby village of Ulleskelf.",
