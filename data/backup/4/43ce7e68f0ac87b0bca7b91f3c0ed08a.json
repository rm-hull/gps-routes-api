  "description": "This lovely nature reserve near Preston has lots of nice footpaths to follow around a series of lakes. The area has been transformed from an old quarry into a splendid wetland and woodland nature reserve. There's miles of surfaced trails to follow past 250 acres of pools, reedbeds and woodland. The site also includes the nation's first floating visitor village. This includes a lovely lakeside cafe and a visitor centre with a wealth of information on the wildlife visiting the reserve. This includes heron,\u00a0great crested grebe, osprey,\u00a0roe deer, otter\u00a0and\u00a0bittern. There are a number of hides and lookout points from which to observe the birds. There's a good sized car park at the site but if you'd like to visit the reserve by bike then National Route 622 and the Preston Guild Wheel will take you into Brockholes from nearby Preston. There's cycle racks by the car park where you can lock up your bike. The Ribble Way long distance walk also passes the site so you could pick this up and enjoy a riverside stroll. Heading north will take you towards Grimsargh, while heading west takes you to Fishwick Bottoms and Avenham Park in Preston.",
