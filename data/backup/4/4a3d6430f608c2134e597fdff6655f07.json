  "description": "This famous port city in Tyne and Wear has some nice riverside and coastal walking trails to try. There's also local country parks, rail trails and several waymarked long distance footpaths to pick up in the area. This walk takes you along the coast to visit the lighthouse on Roker Pier before heading to the neighbouring village of Whitburn. The walk starts on the Wearmouth Bridge where you can pick up a footpath and cycleway running east along Sunderland Harbour. You'll pass the university, the marina and the North Pier before coming to Roker Beach and the Roker Pier. Here you can walk out to the lighthouse and enjoy views back to the city. On this opening section you will also pass a number of sculptures next to the River Wear. At the pier you can pick up the Weardale Way and follow the waymarked footpath north along the coast. You'll pass Parson's Rocks, Seaburn and South Bents before coming to Whitburn. Here you could extend the walk by continuing north to visit Souter Lighthouse and Whitburn Coastal Park . Head further north and there's the National Trust's Marsden Rocks and the South Shields coast where there are a series of interesting geological formations to see. You could also climb to the Cleadon Hills and enjoy fine views over the area.",
