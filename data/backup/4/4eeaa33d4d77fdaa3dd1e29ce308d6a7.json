      "caption": "Trig Point on Bromley Muir, looking down to the islands below. On a clear day, this a very good spot from which to appreciate certain features of Scotland's geology, as explained below. The dark distant mountain in the extreme left of the background is Ben Lomond, its summit lost in the clouds. Located left of centre is the largest of Loch Lomond's islands, Inchmurrin (\"Island of St Mirrin\"). There are few smaller islands strung out in a line beside Inchmurrin (in this photo, they are to its right). They are: Creinch, \"Island of the Trees\", easily picked out here as a small domed island with a wide flat line (the isle of Inchfad) above it; to the right again are Torrinch, \"The hill [or tower] island\", and Inchcailloch, \"Island of the old woman [or the nun]\", although from this angle they seem to blend into Conic Hill. To locate the long ridge of Conic Hill in the photograph, note that it is slightly darker than the hills behind it, and that it seems to be sticking out to the left from the top quarter of the trig point. The ridge lines up perfectly with the chain of islands, as can be seen even more clearly from Conic Hill itself. As those photos make plain, the course of this line continues as hills on the other side of the loch. The alignment, which is quite conspicuous even from this trig point, is no coincidence: both the ridge and the islands lie along the course of the Highland Boundary Fault, which traverses the entire width of Scotland."
