  "description": "This walk follows a section of the South West Coast Path from Exmouth to Sidmouth. It runs for a distance of about 12 miles, passing along the area's red sandstone cliff tops with great views for the duration of the walk. The walk starts from Exmouth Docks where you pick up and follow the coast path east along the River Exe estuary and Exmouth Beach. You'll pass the Queen Victoria Diamond Jubilee Clock and Maer Rocks before coming to the noteworthy Orcombe Point. The spot is most westerly point of the Jurassic Coast and is marked with The Geoneedle sculpture. This was unveiled by Charles, Prince of Wales, in 2002 to mark the western end of the Jurrassic Coast World Heritage Site. It is made from a sample of each of the different rock types which can be found along the Jurassic coast. The path continues past the Devon Cliffs Holiday Park and the East Devon Golf Course before coming to the coastal town of Budleigh Salterton. You'll pass along the pretty beach before coming to the Otter Estuary. The estuary is very pretty consisting of a variety of habitats including salt marsh, reed beds, low-lying meadows and pastureland. It's also a great place for bird watching. Look out for birds including cormorant, redshank, common sandpiper and curlew. The route then crosses the river and continues along the coast path past Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay. Here you will find the striking sandstone sea stacks in a lovely bay with a small beach. The 'Otter Sandstone' that forms the cliffs and sea stacks were deposited in hot dry climates in the Triassic Period about 220 Million years ago. The final section passes viewpoints at High Peak and Peak Hill before coming into Sidmouth. Here you'll find a nice beach and lots of good cafes and pubs for refreshments after your exercise.",
