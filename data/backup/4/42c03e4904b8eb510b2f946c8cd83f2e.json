  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Thames Path National Trail from Pangbourne in Berkshire to Goring in South Oxfordshire. There are train stations at either end of the route so you can catch the train back if you would like to save some energy. If you prefer a longer circular walk then you could cross to the other side of the Thames and then follow roads to Lower Basildon and then pick up the riverside towpath. This would allow you to visit the National Trust's Basildon Park where you'll find miles of trails around the expansive old estate. This linear walk is just under 5 miles following the waymarked trail north from Pangbourne to Whitchurch, Coombe Park and Gatehampton Manor before coming to Goring. It is mostly fairly flat with a small climb at the start of the walk.",
