  "description": "Enjoy 275 acres of riverside parkland in this delightful country park near Ashington. The park is situated on a particularly beautiful part of the River Wansbeck with peaceful woodland that includes Oak, Beech, Silver Birch, Hazel, Sycamore, Ash, Scots Pine, Hawthorn and Willow. There is also a variety of plants and flowers including Forget-me-not, Foxglove, Lesser Celandine, Sweet Woodruff and Yarrow. The river and woodland also attracts a variety of wildlife with Heron, Kingfisher, Moorhen, Vole and Roe deer sighted in the park. If you'd like to continue your walk why not follow the river east towards the coast and Newbiggin By the Sea which is just over two miles from the park. There's some nice trails along the beach and bay with a noteworthy 13th century church and an interesting old 17th century pub to visit too.",
