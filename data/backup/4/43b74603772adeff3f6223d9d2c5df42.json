  "description": "Enjoy lakes, canals, woodlands and historic villages on this waymarked walk through the Worcestershire and Warwickshire countryside. The walk begins at the Forehill picnic site, just outside Birmingham, and heads to Tanworth-in-Arden on country lanes and footpaths. This section of the walk passes the three man-made reservoirs at Earlswood Lakes and the interesting Transport Museum at Wythall with its extensive collection of buses, battery electric vehicles and a miniature steam railway. From Tanworth-in-Arden you continue east towards the village of Lapworth, passing the 17th century Umberslade Hall and Park on the way. The mansion is a a Grade II* listed building and is surrounded by parkland and lakes. At Lapworth you join the Stratford Upon Avon Canal for a short waterside stretch which takes you to Kingswood Junction where the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal meets the Grand Union Canal. A short stroll from Kingswood takes you onto another major highlight on the walk, as you reach the moated manor house of Baddesley Clinton. This medieval manor house dates from the 15th century and includes a pretty garden, lakeside walks and woodland trails in the adjacent Hay Wood. The final section of the walk then takes you to Kenilworth, passing through the peaceful Hay Wood and the village of Wroxhall on the way. You finish at the impressive Kenilworth Castle described by architectural historian Anthony Emery as 'the finest surviving example of a semi-royal palace of the later middle ages, significant for its scale, form and quality of workmanship'. The castle dates from the 16th century and includes a beautiful Elizabethan Garden with a bejewelled aviary and marble fountain.",
