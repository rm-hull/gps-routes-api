  "description": "This walk from the Northumberland village of Riding Mill takes you along a pleasant section of the River Tyne to Dilston via Corbridge . The historic riverside village is a nice place for a stroll with a packhorse bridge and local pub dating from the 17th century. The walk starts from the train station which is located very close to the river. Follow the river trail north and it will take you past Styford Park to Farnley Haugh Gravel Pits. The route continues to Corbridge where you can cross the bridge to explore the town on the opposite side. Here you will find an impressive Roman Fort and a museum detailing the interesting history of the town. The route then crosses back over to continue to Dilston where you can explore the point where the river meets with Devil's Water. In this scenic area there are a number of waterfalls, an old chapel and Dilston Castle to see. To extend the walk you could continue west to visit nearby Hexham . See the Hexham to Corbridge Walk for more details.",
