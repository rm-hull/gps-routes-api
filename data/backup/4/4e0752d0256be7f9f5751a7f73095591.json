  "description": "This walk visits the Lower Barden Reservoir on Barden Moor in the Nidderdale area of Yorkshire. You can follow a circular footpath around the reservoir which runs for about 1.5 miles. There's splendid views across the water to the surrounding moorland and hills. The walk can be extended by following footpaths north west across Barden Moor to visit Upper Barden Reservoir. Both the reservoirs date from the 19th century and feed water into the Barden Beck, which flows into the River Wharfe. You can follow footpaths along the pretty beck at the western end of the site.",
