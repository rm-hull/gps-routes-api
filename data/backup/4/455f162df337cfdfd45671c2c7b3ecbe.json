  "description": "Explore 200 acres of woodland, lake, grassland and parkland in this splendid country park in the Roach Valley. It's great for walkers with miles of footpaths and bridleways to try. It's a lovely setting with wildflowers, woodland trails and great views of the rolling Essex countryside. There's nice footpaths to follow along the river and past the lake. The Roach Valley Way also passes through the park, taking you through the surrounding woodland and countryside. There's lots of wildlife to look out for including Skylark, Grey Partridge and Fieldfare. To extend your walk you could follow the Roach Valley Way to the nearby Hockley Woods. The woods are only about a mile away and contain Oak and sweet chestnut trees, streams, bluebells and wildflowers.",

      "content": "The Bull Inn is beautifully positioned, right on the edge of the nearby Hockley woods. It's a historic pub of some note, dating from the 16th century and Grade II listed. The Bull connects the lovely woodland walks of Hockley with the rolling landscape of the Crouch River Valley to the north. There's a cosy olde worlde interior and outside there's a lovely garden to relax in on finer days. You can find the pub on the northern side of the woods at a postcode of SS5 4RN for your sat navs."
