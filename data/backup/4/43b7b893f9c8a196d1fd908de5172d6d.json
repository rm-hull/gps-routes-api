Many of its close relations are highly toxic, including the similar looking Amanita pantherina. Risk of incorrect identification is high, and it would probably be best to stick to the cautious principle of not consuming wild fungi with gills. This specimen was growing beneath a spreading beech tree."

An earthwork defines the boundary of the Purlieu (called the Bishop's Dyke) and is still visible today."

It also provides an opportunity for new seedlings to establish if they are protected from the grazing ponies and deer by the tangle of branches."

  "description": "This walk visits Denny Wood and the Denny Inclosure in the New Forest. It's one of the more peaceful areas of the forest with mainly oak and beech trees. Keep your eyes peeled for deer on the walk as they are often spotted in this tranquil area. The walk starts from the Denny Wood campsite area where there is a small parking area. From here you pick up trails and head south. These are shared cycling and walking trails running along National Cycle Network Route 2. They will take you past Denny Lodge before turning around to visit the Stubby Copse Inclosure and the Parkhill Inclosure. You then pass the Little Holmhill Inclosure and Church Place, the site of a former royal hunting lodge. Shortly after you pass Thorn Hill and return to the car park.",
