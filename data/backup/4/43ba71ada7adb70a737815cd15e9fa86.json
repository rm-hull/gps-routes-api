  "description": "This walk visits the southernmost point of Sussex in the town of Selsey. You can park at the East Beach car park to start your walk. From there it's a nice 1 mile walk along the pretty beach to Selsey Bill. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments in one of the cafes. The area is also well known for its excellent fresh fish huts. The walk can be extended by visiting the nearby Pagham Harbour. It's located just to the north of Selsey and includes a fantastic nature reserve with thousands of wading birds. If you head north west from the headland you can visit East Wittering and West Wittering with views of Bracklesham Bay. Here you can enjoy a walk through the sand dunes at East Head and pick up the long distance New Lipchis Way to take you into Chichester. You can also enjoy more nice walking trails around Chichester Harbour and Thorney Island .",
