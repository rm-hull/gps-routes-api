  "description": "This circular walk visits the wonderful old kilns at Rosedale Chimney Bank near Rosedale Abbey on the North York Moors. The walk can be started from the car park just south of Rosedale Abbey at Bank Top. You can then pick up trails around the impressive Bank Top Kilns. The huge photogenic kilns are a remnant of the site's 19th century ironstone industry. The on site information board provides more detail on the Victorian history of the area. There's also some fantastic views over the surrounding North York Moors from the elevated position of the kilns. Look out for lovely heather during the late summer months too. The area is also popular with cyclists because of the steep gradient of the hill. It is often referred to as the 'chain braker'. To continue your walking in the area head north and pick up the Rosedale Abbey Walk .",
