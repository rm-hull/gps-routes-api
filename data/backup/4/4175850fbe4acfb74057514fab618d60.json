  "description": "This walk in the forest explores the Whitefield Moor area. The moor is a popular place for walks with waymarked trails around an open area of grassland. You will often see people playing games as well as ponies, cows and horses grazing here. In contrast to many of the walks in the forest this one is a more open route across open moorland and heathland rather than a woodland trail. Start the walk from the Whitefield Moor car park, just west of Brockenhurst . From here you can pick up trails taking you around the moor towards Beacham Wood before returning along the Rhinefield Road. The walk then continues west onto White Moor where you can follow trails to the Silver Stream before climbing to Holm Hill. Around here you will climb to a height of over 200 feet with fine views over the surrounding area to enjoy. The route then heads across Wilverley Plain and Hinchelsea Moor before passing Red Hill and returning to the car park.",
