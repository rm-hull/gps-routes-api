  "description": "Enjoy a climb to Deacon Hill and enjoy wonderful views over the Chilterns on this walk in the Pegsdon Hills. The hills are also a designated nature reserve so there's lots of intersting flora and fauna to see as well. There's a series of footpaths to follow across the site where you will find chalk hills and wildflower meadows with orchids and\u00a0moschatels. In the summer months the flowers attract butterflies such as dingy\u00a0and\u00a0grizzled skippers. There are fine views of the surrounding Chiltern Hills from the high points which reach nearly 172 metres at Deacon Hill. Start the walk from the car park on the Pirton Road just to the east of the site. From here you can pick up the Icknield Way Path and follow it towards Deacon Hill where there's a trig point and wonderful views to enjoy. The route then follows other footpaths across the hills before picking up the Icknield Way to return you to the car park. On your walk you may see a deer and various birds including skylark, buzzard and fieldfare. The hills are located close to the town of Hitchin. You can follow our Hitchin Walk from the town as an alternative start point. The circular Pirton Walk is another good option. The Barton Hills and Sharpenhoe Clappers are located nearby and are great options for continuing your walking in the area. Barton Hills is a lovely nature reserve with downland, chalk grassland and beech\u00a0woodland to explore. You can pick up the John Bunyan Trail just to the west of Pegsdon Hills and follow it to Barton Hills. The popular chalk escarpment at Sharpenhoe Clappers includes and Iron Age Hillfort and views of the Smithcombe Hills.",
