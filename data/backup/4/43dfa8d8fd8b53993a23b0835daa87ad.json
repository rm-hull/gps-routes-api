  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Parbold Hill from the village of Parbold in Lancashire. You'll visit the wonderful viewpoint with views towards the Pennine Hills and beyond. The route also continues to climb Hunters Hill and Harrock Hill for more good views and lovely countryside. The walk starts from Parbold train station and heads along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal before turning north to climb to the Parbold Hill viewpoint. Here you will find a plaque showing you all of the sights you can see from the top. This includes Ashurst Beacon, Dalton, the River Douglas, the city of Liverpool and the Berwyn Mountains of Wales. After taking in the views the walk continues north to High Moor and Harrock Hill. The route then turns south, descending to Hunter's Hill before returning to Parbold village. This walk passes close to Fairy Glen which is well worth a short detour if you have time. The delightful beauty spot includes pretty streams, beautiful\u00a0waterfalls, dramatic cliff faces, wooden bridges and shady woodland trails. To extend your walk you could head west along the canal to Burscough and visit the lovely Martin Mere Nature Reserve. You could also climb to the nearby Ashurst Beacon and enjoy more nice views to the coast.",
