  "description": "Follow the coastal path from Portishead to Clevedon on this point to point walk in Somerset. There's pretty bays, nice beaches, sandstone cliffs and great views across the Severn Estuary into Wales. The route runs along a fairly flat path for about 5 miles. The walk starts from the Portishead Lake where there is a nice park, lakeside cafe and car parking. Just to the north is Portishead Point lighthouse at Battery Point which is another good start point for the walk. From the park you head south along the Mariner's Path to Black Nore lighthouse. The Grade II listed building was built in 1894 to guide shipping in the Severn Estuary as it made its way in and out of Bristol Harbour. You continue past Redcliff Bay, Charlcombe Bay and Walton Bay where you reach the coastal golf course. The route continues past the 17th Century, Grade II listed Walton Castle and Ladye Bay before passing along the sea front in Clevedon and finishing at the pier. You can either return the same way or catch the bus back. The walk uses part of the long distance Gordano Round trail. The figure of eight walk takes you on a tour of the coast, countryside, woodland and villages around Portishead. It's a great way to extend your walking in the area. You could also visit the lovely Portbury Wharf on our Portishead Nature Reserve Walk .The attractive 113 acre site provides a vital buffer of green land between Portishead and the Portbury Dock industrial complex.",
