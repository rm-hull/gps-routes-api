      "caption": "Dunmore Head is the westernmost point of mainland Ireland and one of the westernmost points of Europe.  The headland is composed of cross-bedded sandstones from the Eask Sandstone Formation, which dates back to the Devonian period. This rock formation, commonly known as Old Red Sandstone, is characteristic of sedimentary rocks formed approximately 419 to 358 million years ago. The term Old Red Sandstone traditionally refers to a suite of continental sediments, largely formed by the erosion of ancient mountains. In areas like Mount Eagle, the steeply dipping beds of sandstone give a glimpse into the geological past, illustrating how tectonic activity has influenced the landscape over millions of years. The region's cross-bedded structures, which were formed in river systems, further highlight the dynamic environment in which these rocks were deposited."

  "description": "This walk visits some wonderful coastal cliffs on the westernmost part of the Dingle Peninsula. You can start the walk from the car parking area near Coumeenoole Bay where there is a pretty beach. From here pick up footpaths heading west towards the lookout post and the Coumeenoole Ogham Stone. Continue west and you will soon come to the westernmost point of mainland Ireland where there are some fabulous cliff top views towards Blasket Island . To continue your walking in the area you could head east to visit Slea Head . There are some interesting ancient huts and more great views in this area.",
