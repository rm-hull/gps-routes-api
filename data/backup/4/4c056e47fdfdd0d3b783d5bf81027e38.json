  "description": "This circular walk from the Roman Town of Caistor takes you through the countryside to the neighbouring villages of Nettleton and Rothwell. There's some lovely Lincolnshire Wolds scenery and attractive villages to see on the route. Caistor has many attractive Georgian buildings but dates back to as Roman times. Nettleton , has an interesting Ironstone mining history, while Rothwell boasts a fine old pub where you can stop off for refreshments on the walk. The walk starts in Caistor where you can pick up the Viking Way and follow the waymarked trail south along the Nettleton Brook towards Nettleton and Normanby le Wold. Before you reach Normanby you turn east along a track to take you to the pretty little village of Rothwell. From here you head north before another bridle track takes you west back towards Nettleton.",
