You start on the River Erme in Ivybridge and follow the river to south Ermington before heading west to Yealmpton via Flete and Butland Wood. The route continues through Brixton and Combe before arriving at the outskirts at Plymouth where you will pass the lovely Hooe Lake before finishing on Laira Bridge over the River Plym.",
