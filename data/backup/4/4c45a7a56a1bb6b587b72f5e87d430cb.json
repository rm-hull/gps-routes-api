  "description": "This 126-acre riverside park consists of woodland, meadows and riverside banks with views of the River Severn. The park has several lovely waymarked trails while National Cycle Route 45 also runs through the park. Features in the park include a lake with a bird hide, a woodland walk along a boardwalk and a delightful riverside path. There is also an informative visitor centre and picnic areas. If you have time you could continue your walk along the River Severn and the Severn Way towards Bridgnorth or Bewdley. Heading south along the river would take you to the delightful Arley Arboretum and Trimpley Reservoir. Around here you can try our Severn Valley Railway Walk which offers great view of the wonderful old heritage railway. On a cycle you could also continue your ride along National Cycle 45 towards the two nearby towns mentioned above. The park is located about six miles south of Bridgnorth.",
