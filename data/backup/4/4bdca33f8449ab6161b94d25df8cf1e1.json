  "description": "Enjoy a nice coastal stroll on this easy walk along the Essex coast. The route runs from the popular seaside resort of Southend to the town of Leigh on Sea, about 3 miles to the west. You start off on the front at Southend next to the noteworthy pier. The structure stretches 1.34 miles (2.16 km) into the Thames Estuary, and is the longest pleasure pier in the world. It includes the Southend Pier Railway which will take you to the pier head. There's also views of the Adventure Island theme park in this area. From here you head west passing the pretty cliff gardens which are worth a small detour from the front. The elevated park includes formal and informal gardens with beautiful views across the Thames Estuary. The route then passes Westcliff-on-Sea, Chalkwell and Leigh Cliffs before finishing at Leigh-on-Sea. Here you can catch the train back to Southend or return on foot if you prefer. If you'd like to extend the walk then you could visit Two Tree Island which is located just a short stroll from Leigh on Sea. The expansive nature reserve includes lagoons, pretty streams and great views across Hadleigh Ray to Canvey Island. To continue your walking in the area try the Southend Millennium Walk. The long distance circular trail takes you to Hadleigh Country Park and the ruins of Hadleigh Castle before heading inland through the attractive Essex Countryside. You could also try the Benfleet to Leigh on Sea which visits Hadleigh Marshes and Benfleet Creek.",
