  "description": "Follow the cliff top path from Cromer to Overstrand on this walk along the Norfolk coast. The cliffs rise to a height of over 250ft giving great views across both settlements and along the coast. It's a short walk at just over 2 miles, but there is some moderate climbing, so a reasonable level of fitness is required. The walk starts on the sea front in Cromer next to the pier. The Grade II listed pier is the home of the Cromer Lifeboat Station and the Pavilion Theatre. You pass along the sea front before climbing away from the town towards Cromer Lighthouse. The present lighthouse was built half of a mile from the cliff edge (although it is now much closer) and came into operation in 1833. It is constructed of masonry and the tower is octagonal in shape and is 59 feet (18 m) tall. The path continues along the Royal Cromer Golf Club, before descending to the village of Overstrand. Here you can enjoy refreshments at the cliff top cafe before the return leg. You can turn it into a circular walk by returning along the beach if you wish. See the video below for more details. The walk forms the first part of the long distance Paston Way so you can extend your exercise by continuing along the path to Bacton and North Walsham. You could also head in the other direction on the Cromer to Sheringham Walk. Here you can you can enjoy walks in the lovely Sheringham Park. The National Trust owned estate includes miles of peaceful woodland trails and beautiful landscaped gardens full of rhododendrons and azaleas. If you head south east along the England Coast Path you could visit the delightful village of Mundesley. It's a popular area with sandy beaches and a nice coastal path to follow to nearby Bacton.",
