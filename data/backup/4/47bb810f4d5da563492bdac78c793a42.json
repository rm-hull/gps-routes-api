  "description": "This Cumbrian village is located at the foot of Blencathra in the Lake District National Park. The popular climb to the exceptional viewpoint often starts from the village. Threlkeld is also at one end of the Keswick Railway Path, a cycling and walking trail running to Keswick along the old railway line. The village includes an 18th century church and two fine pubs dating back to the 17th century. This walk from the village takes you to the Threlkeld Quarry Museum which lies just to the south of the settlement. You can follow footpaths along the Kilnhow Beck and along the River Glenderamackin to reach the quarry. Here you can enjoy a ride on the narrow gauge railway that runs into the old quarry. There's also a collection of historic machinery, such as locomotives and cranes, an underground tour of a realistic mine, a comprehensive geological and mining museum, and mineral panning. You can extend the walk by heading west along the railway path through the River Greta Valley where there's some lovely views of the surrounding hills.",

There's a cosy interior with cartoons around the bar and restaurant area of a previous owner drawn by the famous local artist Wikes. There's also the Salutation Inn which dates to 1664. Outside there's fine views up to the Blencathra from the lovely south facing garden area. Inside there's a charming interior with flag stone floors, oak beams and roaring log fires. They also do good food and quality accommodation if you need to stay over. You can find the pub at a postcode of CA12 4SQ for your sat navs. It's also dog friendly if you have your four legged friend with you."
