  "description": "This Cumbrian village is located at the foot of Blencathra in the Lake District National Park. The popular climb to the exceptional viewpoint often starts from the village. Threlkeld is also at one end of the Keswick Railway Path, a cycling and walking trail running to Keswick along the old railway line. The village includes an 18th century church and two fine pubs dating back to the 17th century. This walk from the village takes you to the Threlkeld Quarry Museum which lies just to the south of the settlement. You can follow footpaths along the Kilnhow Beck and along the River Glenderamackin to reach the quarry. Here you can enjoy a ride on the narrow gauge railway that runs into the old quarry. There's also a collection of historic machinery, such as locomotives and cranes, an underground tour of a realistic mine, a comprehensive geological and mining museum, and mineral panning. You can extend the walk by heading west along the railway path through the River Greta Valley where there's some lovely views of the surrounding hills.",
