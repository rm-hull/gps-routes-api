  "description": "This circular route has some challenging climbs but with some truly tremendous views of the Sirhowy Valley and Ebbw Valley as the reward. The walk starts at the Cwmcarn Visitor Centre and heads to Mynydd Islwyn, Ynys Hywel and Glenside before returning to Cwmcarn where you can explore the expansive Cwmcarn Forest and enjoy a climb to Twmbarlwm Iron Age Hillfort. The route includes views of the Sirhowy and Ebbw rivers, the Severn Estuary in the south and the Brecon Beacons in the north. You will also visit Nant-y-draenog reservoir and pass the wonderful viewpoint at Machen Mountain on the way. The path is waymarked with the distinctive black and white Raven walk logo.",
