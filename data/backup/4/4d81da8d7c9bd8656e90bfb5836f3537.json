  "description": "This town on the north east coast has some nice walks to try along its beaches, nature reserve and old quay. This coastal walk from the town takes you to the Teesmouth National Nature Reserve, located a few miles south of the town. Along the way there's beaches, sand dunes and views of Hartlepool Bay and Tees Bay. The walk starts at Hartlepool's fascinating Historic Quay where there are old ships and a wonderful naval museum. From here you can pick up a shared cycling and walking trail and follow it south along Hartlepool Bay to Hewburn Bridge and Carr House Sands. The route continues along Seaton Sands and Tees Bay before strolling out onto the North Gare Breakwater. Here you will find North Gare Sands and the Teesmouth National Nature Reserve. The reserve has some lovely beaches, sand dunes and lots of birdlife to see. During the winter months Knot from Greenland and the Canadian Arctic, Shelduck, Teal and Sanderling are seen. In spring, Ringed Plover, Lapwing, Oystercatcher and Snipe nest.\u00a0The reserve is also unusual as it is surrounded by one of the largest concentrations of heavy industry in Britain including Hartlepool Power Station. You can then follow a circular footpath around the golf course at Seaton Snook before following the same paths back into Hartlepool.",
