  "description": "This little village in the Peak District is close to some splendid hill climbs and canalside trails. There's also a noteworthy 15th century school and the Grade II listed Shrigley Hall to see here. This circular walk from the village visits Styperson Pool, the Macclesfield Canal and Bakestonedale Moor. The walk starts in the village and follows country lanes west, passing Shrigley Hall, a Grade II listed Regency style building dating back to 1825. You will soon come to Styperson Park where there's an old quarry and a small pretty lake. After passing the lake you will come to the canal where you follow the towpath north for about a mile. The route then head south east along the North Cheshire Way to Birchencliff before climbing to the high point on the walk at Bakestonedale Moor. Here you can enjoy some fine views across the Cheshire Plain before descending south west on the Gritstone Trail. You could take a detour from the route by following the popular trail south west into Bollington and climbing to the excellent viewpoint at White Nancy. This route heads west past Berristhall Hall to return to the village. Next to the canal you can extend the walk by picking up the Middlewood Way. This shared cycling and walking route runs along a disused railway line between Macclesfield and Marple. Just to the north of the route there's the wonderful Lyme Park with its viewpoints, old hall and herd of deer to see.",
