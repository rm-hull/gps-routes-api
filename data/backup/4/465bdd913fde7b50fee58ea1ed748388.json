Opened in 1862, it was shortly afterwards taken over by the London & North Western Railway, but was an early victim of the post-war Nationalization of the railways, closing to passenger traffic in 1952. It now forms sections of both National Cycle Network Routes 6 (London to Keswick) and 61 (Rickmansworth to Ware)."

It runs on waterside paths and also passes a series of pretty lakes. The Celandine Route also runs just to the east of the trail. It will take you along the River Pinn from Pinner to Cowley. Part of the trail runs along the Croxley Green Boundary Walk. This waymarked circular walk explores the area around the worthy village, visiting the canal and the River Gade on the way. You'll pass the southern edge of the trail as you pass Watford and Rickmansworth. For more walking ideas in the area see the London Walks page."
