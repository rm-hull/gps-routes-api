Opened in 1862, it was shortly afterwards taken over by the London & North Western Railway, but was an early victim of the post-war Nationalization of the railways, closing to passenger traffic in 1952. It now forms sections of both National Cycle Network Routes 6 (London to Keswick) and 61 (Rickmansworth to Ware)."
