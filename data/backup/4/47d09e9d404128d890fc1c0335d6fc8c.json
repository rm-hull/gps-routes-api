  "description": "This interesting village in West Yorkshire has some nice riverside trails and several local reservoirs to visit. It's also on the Calderdale Way, a waymarked footpath which explores the beautiful district of Calderdale. This walk from the village takes you along the River Ryburn to the nearby Ryburn Reservoir. There's peaceful riverside woodland and good trails around the reservoir with views of the surrounding Calderdale countryside. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up a footpath heading south west along the River Ryburn. You cross the river before following the Barr Mill Lane west to reach the reservoir. You pass some old mills before following a footpath along the northern edge of the water towards Beeston Hall Rocks. The trail then heads to the south of the reservoir past Hanson Wood before continuing towards Rishworth Hall. You then turn north to return to Ripponden along the river.",
