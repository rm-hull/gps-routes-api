  "description": "This interesting village in West Yorkshire has some nice riverside trails and several local reservoirs to visit. It's also on the Calderdale Way, a waymarked footpath which explores the beautiful district of Calderdale. This walk from the village takes you along the River Ryburn to the nearby Ryburn Reservoir. There's peaceful riverside woodland and good trails around the reservoir with views of the surrounding Calderdale countryside. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up a footpath heading south west along the River Ryburn. You cross the river before following the Barr Mill Lane west to reach the reservoir. You pass some old mills before following a footpath along the northern edge of the water towards Beeston Hall Rocks. The trail then heads to the south of the reservoir past Hanson Wood before continuing towards Rishworth Hall. You then turn north to return to Ripponden along the river.",

Head north east and it will take you up onto Norland Moor which is particularly lovely in late summer when the area is covered in purple heather. Just to the north is Sowerby Bridge where you can pick up the Calder and Hebble Navigation Canal and enjoy an easy stroll along the towpath. There's more waterside walking to the south at Booth Wood Reservoir, Deanhead Reservoir and the expansive Scammonden Reservoir. The tremendous climb to Blackstone Edge is also not far away. Here there's unique rock formations & sweeping views to enjoy.  For more walks in the county see the Yorkshire Walks page."
