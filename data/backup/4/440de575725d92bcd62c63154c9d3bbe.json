  "description": "This large park between Cheam and Ewell Village is ideal for a peaceful afternoon stroll or safe family cycle. There are wide lawns, pretty gardens, woodland and Nonsuch Mansion where you can enjoy refreshments and learn about the history of the park and Palace. The park is the site of Nonsuch Palace, a Tudor royal palace, built by Henry VIII in the 16th century. It stood from 1538 to 1682\u20133 and was one of his grandest building projects. The London Loop runs through the park so you could pick up this trail if you wanted to continue your walk. If you follow it south for just over a mile, you will come to Banstead Downs. The downs are well worth a visit with open grass chalkland, wildflowers and nice views towards London from the high points.",
