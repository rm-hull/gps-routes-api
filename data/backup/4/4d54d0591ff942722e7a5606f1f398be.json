  "description": "This circular walk explores the Lancing Ring Nature Reserve in West Sussex. The site includes good footpaths taking you to chalk grassland and decidous woodland. It's great for wildlife with butterflies, adders, common lizards and dragonflies by the dew pond. There's also lots of pretty wildflowers, including the early purple orchid. From the high points in the reserve there are great views across the surrounding countryside. To continue your walking in the area head south to the coast where you can enjoy a walk along the beach to Shoreham by Sea. Just to the east there's the River Adur to Bramber Castle Walk to try as well.",
