  "description": "Visit the largest ancient woodland in Norfolk on this peaceful walk near Dereham. There's 123 hectares (300 acres) to explore on a number of nice footpaths. The site is also a designated nature reserve so there's a wide variety of flora and fauna to look out for on your walk. Bluebells are a big draw in spring but there's also early purple orchid, lily of the valley, dog's mercury, purple hairstreak, meadowsweet, water avens and fleabane to see. The woods are great for wildlife too with white admiral butterflies, sparrowhawks, tawny owls, great spotted woodpeckers and European green woodpeckers. You can start the walk at the car park off Themelthorpe Road on the western side of the woods. From here you can pick up the trails to create a circular walk around the site. To extend your walking in the area you could head east and pick up the Marriot's Way long distance trail. The shared cycling and walking trail explores the lovely River Wensum Valley .",

In the village you can also pick up the Walsingham Way and the Wensum Way long distance footpaths. The ancient Norman Chapel of North Elmham and the Sparham Pools Nature Reserve at Lyng are also located in this area."
