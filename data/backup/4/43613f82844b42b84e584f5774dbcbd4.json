  "description": "Visit the largest ancient woodland\u00a0in Norfolk on this peaceful walk near Dereham . There's 123 hectares (300 acres)\u00a0to explore on a number of nice footpaths. The site is also a designated nature reserve so there's a wide variety of flora and fauna to look out for on your walk. Bluebells are a big draw in spring but there's also\u00a0early purple orchid,\u00a0lily of the valley, dog's mercury,\u00a0purple hairstreak,\u00a0meadowsweet,\u00a0water avens and fleabane\u00a0to see. The woods are great for wildlife too with white admiral butterflies, sparrowhawks,\u00a0tawny owls,\u00a0great spotted woodpeckers\u00a0and\u00a0European green woodpeckers. You can start the walk at the car park off Themelthorpe Road on the western side of the woods. From here you can pick up the trails to create a circular walk around the site. To extend your walking in the area you could head east and pick up the Marriot's Way long distance trail. The shared cycling and walking trail explores the lovely River Wensum Valley .",
