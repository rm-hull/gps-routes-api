Henry lived at Betchworth Castle with his wife, Charlotte Mary Morrison, and his twelve children until his death in 1827. After Henry\u2019s death, Betchworth Castle was not inherited by his children and therefore was bought by David Barclay and later by Henry Hope, who demolished large parts of the castle and left it in ruin, as is seen today."

  "description": "This small village is located near Dorking in Surrey. The village is close to a Scheduled Ancient monument, a significant golf course and the River Mole. Start the walk in the village where you can pick up the Greensand Way and follow the waymarked path west. You'll cross the River Mole and pass the neighbouring village of Brockham. Here you turn north west to follow the Coach Road past the golf course at Betchworth Park. Trails can be followed east from here to the medieval ruined castle which sits next to the river. From the elevated castle there are some splendid views to enjoy over the river to the surrounding Surrey countryside.",
