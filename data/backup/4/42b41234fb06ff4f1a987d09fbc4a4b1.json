  "description": "Visit the the oldest surviving single-arch railway bridge in the world and enjoy woodland trails along the Causey Burn on this lovely circular walk in Stanley. The site includes interesting geology and views of the Tanfield railway which runs through the area. Also look out for the replica of an old wooden horse drawn coal truck. At its peak the track would see hundreds of these waggons carrying coal to the bridge. The bridge dates from 1725 and is a wonderful example of 18th century civil engineering. From the top of the arch there are splendid views down to the streams and woodland below. The walk lasts for about 2 miles on fairly flat footpaths, but with a couple of moderate climbs on the way. After your exercise you can enjoy rest and refreshments at the nice on site tea room. The walk starts from the car park just off the Causey Road. You could also start from Causey Arch railway station which is one of the stops on the Tanfield Heritage Railway. It's the oldest railway in the world, operating a passenger service every Sunday and on some other selected days. The railway runs on the former colliery wooden waggonway, using a number of preserved industrial steam locomotives. Part of this route uses the Great North Forest Heritage Trail which runs through the area. You can extend your walk by continuing along the trail towards Chester-le-Street. Just to the west you will find Chopwell Wood where there are miles of good cycling and walking trails to try.",
