A remediation programme implemented over the following years restored water quality, leading to the return of fish to the gill by 2016."

  "description": "This walk takes you along the Saltburn Gill in Saltburn, Redcar and Cleveland. The walk starts off from the car park in Old Saltburn, close to the start of the gill. Here you can pick up a footpath heading south east along the water. Along the way there's peaceful woodland and countryside views to enjoy. The site is designated as a nature reserve so look out for lots of interesting flora and fauna. The walk finishes just to the east of Brotton. You can continue your walking in the area at the lovely Saltburn Valley Gardens .",
