  "description": "This Cheshire based village makes a great base for exploring the surrounding countryside and woodland of the expansive Delamere Forest and the Sandstone Hills. This route uses sections of the Eddisbury Way, the Sandstone Trail and the Delamere Way to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. On the way there's a visit to Delamere Forest, Blakemere Moss and the excellent viewpoint at Old Pale Hill. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Eddisbury Way and follow the waymarked footpath north to Brine's Brow, where the route meets with the Baker Way. This route heads east into Delamere Forest where woodland trails will lead you past Black Lake to Blakemere Moss. There's a nice circular trail to try around this pretty lake. You then pick up the Sandstone Trail and follow it south to Pale Heights on Old Pale Hill. Here you can enjoy fine views to the Manchester skyline, Merseyside and and the mountains of North Wales. There's also three transmitter masts which carry radio, television and telephone signals. You continue past Nettleford Wood, Hangingstone Hill, Primrosehill Wood, Urchins Kitchen and Summertrees. You then head west passing Boothdale before linking up with the Eddisbury Way again near Weetwood Common and Willington Corner. You can then follow the trail north back into Kelsall.",
