  "description": "This walk follows the coastal path from Bucks Mills to Clovelly in North Devon. On the way you'll enjoy nice woodland trails through the Bucks and Keivells Nature Reserve and enjoy lovely views of Barnstaple Bay. The route runs fors just over 4 miles on an undulating path, with some climbs on the way. The walk starts from the Bucks Mills Reserve car park where you can pick up footpaths heading north to join the South West Coast Path. There's a stream that runs through the village and falls over the cliff edge in a waterfall onto the beach which has large pebbles and hard sandstone formations. From the coast path the route then heads west past the Bideford Bay Holiday Village and Barton Wood. You'll walk along the Hobby Drive which is a nice peaceful woodland trail which leads you all the way to Clovelly. Here you will find a lovely harbour, a steep pedestrianised cobbled main street and fine views over the Bristol Channel. The village is also known for its donkeys, giving rides to visitors\u2019 children during the summer months and posing for photographs in the street. To continue your walking from Bucks Mills you could follow the coast path east to Westward Ho with more details on the Westward Ho to Clovelly Walk. In this area you can also visit Northam Burrows Country Park. The park includes fine views over the estuary of the River Torridge with 600 acres of grassy coastal plain, salt marsh, sand dunes and grasslands. If you were to head west you would come to Brownsham Wood where you can enjoy a circular walk visiting Mouth Mill beach and the impressive Blackchurch Rock.  The lovely Hartland Point is located a little further west.",
