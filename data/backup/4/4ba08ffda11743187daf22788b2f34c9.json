The walk visits several pretty villages including West Hallam, Duffield, Brailsford, Edmaston, Shirley and Osmaston. Highlights on the route include the delightful Kedleston Hall which is just to the south of the trail near Duffield. You'll also pass the lovely Osmaston Park where there's a lake, woodland and traces of the old 19th century manor which is now demolished.",
