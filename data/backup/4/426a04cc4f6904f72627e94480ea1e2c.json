  "description": "This coastal walk takes you between these two major Sussex settlements. At just over 26 miles the walk is of marathon length. You'll enjoy some of the best coastal scenery in the country, with pretty beaches and spectacular cliff tops. Starting on the sea front in Brighton, the route heads east along the Undercliff Walk from Brighton Marina to Saltdean. The path runs for about 3 miles along the sea wall with the white cliffs on one side and the shingle beach on the other. The next section takes you to Newhaven with a splendid clifftop trail to enjoy. You will pass Peacehaven and the Greenwich Meridian monument which marks the site where the Greenwich meridian crosses the English south coast. At Newhaven you pass the 19th century Newhaven Fort and Newhaven Harbour, where you cross the River Ouse. You continue to Seaford passing the Martello Tower and the Seaford Head Nature Reserve where there's lots of wildlife to look out for. You then come to Cuckmere River and Cuckmere Haven where you follow a lovely riverside path to the Exceat Bridge. You continue through the Seven Sisters Country Park to the coast, enjoying wonderful views of the Seven Sisters Cliffs. On the coast you pick up the South Downs Way and head east to Birling Gap where you can visit the National Trust owned Belle Tout lighthouse. It's a good place to stop for refreshments with a nice cafe and great sea views. Continuing east you visit the highest chalk sea cliff in Britain, at Beachy Head. From Beachy Head you descend into Eastbourne, passing along the beach before finishing at the pier.",
