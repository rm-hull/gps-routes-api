  "description": "This attractive Peak District village has a nice village green, picturesque old limestone cottages, an historic church and a fine 17th century pub to relax in after your walking. It's in a great spot for starting a walk with two long distance trails and some National Park highlights easily reachable on foot. This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the area including the neighbouring village of Tissington, the splendid viewpoint at Thorpe Cloud at the popular stepping stones in Dovedale. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Limestone Way and follow it south west to Tissington. Here you can see the early 17th-century Jacobean Mansion of Tissington Hall. The Hall is open to the public on certain days and is available for wedding hire. The route then continues south west to Thorpe before turning north to climb to Thorpe Cloud. The distinctive hill top provides fine views over the surrounding countryside of the White Peak. From here you continue north into Dovedale where you can enjoy riverside walks, interesting rock formations and the photogenic stepping stones. At Dove Holes you head north east towards Alsop en le Dale and follow Dam Lane back to Parwich. Near Alsop en le Dale you can pick up the Tissington Trail. This shared cycling and walking route runs along a disused railway line towards Tissington and links up with the Limestone Way near Parwich. You could return this way if you prefer.",
