  "description": "This pretty Leicestershire village is well worth a visit with its picturesque village pond, 13th century church and thatched cottages. There's also a lovely pub with a garden and farm animals to visit. Hallaton is the location for the annual bottle kicking contest which takes place on Easter Monday. See below for details and a video. This route uses sections of the Leicestershire Round , the Midshires Way and the Macmillan Way to create a circular walk through the surrounding countryside. On the way you'll pass a series of neighbouring villages and enjoy some fine scenic views. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Leicestershire Round and follow the waymarked footpath south west to Cranoe, passing the site of the medieval village of Othorpe on the way. At Cranoe you can pick up the Midshires Way and follow it south to Welham where there are views of the River Welland. The route continues by looping around Sutton Bassett where you can pick up the Macmillan Way nearby. This will take you north past Weston by Welland where you cross the river and continue past Medbourne to Slawston Hill. The final section runs past Hallaton House Farm before returning you to the village.",
