  "description": "This walk explores the beautiful Ceibwr Bay on the Pembrokeshire Coast near Cardigan. This beautiful area includes some wonderful cliffs and views of the Nant Ceibwr valley. You can explore the splendid cliff tops paths on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path before heading inland to enjoy views of the river as it enters the sea. The area is great for wildlife spotting with coastal birds such as fulmar, shag, cormorant and chough to see on the cliffs. You may also see bottlenose dolphins and Atlantic grey seals in the waters below. The walk can be started at the small roadside parking area on the western side of the bay, just north of the village of Moylgrove. To extend your walk follow the coast path north to visit Cemaes Head or south to the beautiful beaches at Newport .",
