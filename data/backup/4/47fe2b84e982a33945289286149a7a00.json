  "description": "This attractive market town is located in the Breckland District of Norfolk. There are some nice woodland trails to the west of the town, waterside walks through the Nar Valley to the north and miles of trails in the nearby Thetford Forest. The Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path National Trail also runs just to the east of the town, providing an opportunity to explore the surrounding countryside on a good waymarked trail. You may also recognise the town as the setting for the ITV1 series Kingdom, starring Stephen Fry. Kingdom's office is Oakleigh House, near the town square in what is known as Market Shipborough in the series. The town is also notable for its fine Georgian buildings and the very fine church of St Peter and Paul which dates from the medieval period. This walk takes you from the town to Swaffham Heath and Cockley Cley Wood, to the west of the town. The walk starts on the western side of the town where you can follow Shouldham Lane west towards Swaffham Heath. Follow the trails south and they will take you through woodland to Cockleycley Heath and Woods. Here you'll find the 12th century Norman chapel of St Mary's and a series of pretty lakes which are good ford birdwatching. After exploring the village the route returns to Swaffham on the same paths.",
