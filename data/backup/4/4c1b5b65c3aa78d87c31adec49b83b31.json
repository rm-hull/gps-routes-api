  "description": "This route uses sections of the John Bunyan Trail and the Ouse Valley Way to create a circular walk around the Bedfordshire village of Stevington. On the way you'll visit the Stevington Windmill, Pavenham and Oakley. There's fine views of the River Great Ouse and the surrounding countryside to enjoy as you make your way through the area. The historic village itself is also interesting with a medieval church and several listed buildings to see. The walk starts in the village and follows the waymarked footpath north towards Pavenham with a riverside section along the way. The route then heads south east, passing Boswell's Home and crossing the Stafford Bridge over the river before arriving in Oakley. You then cross the Oakley Bridge before heading along the river and coming to the windmill. From here it is a short stroll back into Stevington.",

      "content": "A few miles to the north west there's some nice trails to follow around Harrold Odell Country Park. Here you'll find a pretty lake and good facilities with a car park and visitor centre. The park is also located very close to the worthy villages of Felmersham and Sharnbrook where you'll find pleasant riverside trails, a Norman church, a wildlife rich local nature reserve and a delightful mill theatre converted from the historic old water mill. Due west of Stevington you can visit the lovely village of Turvey. Here you can try the Turvey Circular Walk which uses part of the Milton Keynes Boundary Walk to explore the area around the historic village. The picturesque village includes a medieval bridge, a 17th century abbey and views of the River Great Ouse. Just to the south is the neighbouring village of Bromham where you can visit the old 18th century mill. For more walking ideas in the area see the Bedfordshire Walks page."
