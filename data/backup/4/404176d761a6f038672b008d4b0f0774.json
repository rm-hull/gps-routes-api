  "description": "With stunning views of the Gower Peninsula and Carmarthen Bay this coastal country park is one of the most popular in the UK. It is perfect for a long cycle or walk with numerous well laid trails, National Cycle Network route 4 and St Illtyd's Walk all running through the park and the adjacent Pembrey Forest. Highlights include the gorgeous Cefn Sidan beach with 8 miles of golden sand and extensive dunes. There are also 8 Wildlife trails, the beautiful Corsican pine forest and a Conservation pond with bird hides. The off road cycle trail is perfect for a family cycle ride - you can bring your own bike or hire one from the Ski Pembrey centre. Here you could also hire some skis and try the dry sky slope in the park! It's a top class facility with an Alpine Ski Lodge, Cafe and a floodlit 130m main slope. There's also a fantastic toboggan run, crazy golf and pony trekking on offer. If you'd like to continue your walk/cycle then you could head further into the adjacent Pembrey Forest - it covers nearly 2500 acres with several lovely woodland trails and interesting wildlife including sparrowhawk and goshawk. You could also follow National Cycle Route 4 along the coast to Llanelli where you will find the splendid Millennium Coastal Park or follow St Illtyd's Walk to the lovely Swiss Valley Reservoirs. Also on the bay is the splendid town of Laugharne. Here you can visit two major highlights of the area at Laugharne Castle and the Dylan Thomas Boathouse. The castle dates from the 12th century and has a fascinating history. The boathouse is now a museum with lots of interesting exhibits to view. Just to the north of the park you will find the interesting town of Kidwelly. Our circular walk visits the pretty quay, the River Gwendraeth and the historic Kidwelly Castle.",

      "content": "The park is a great place for dog walking so you'll probably see plenty of other owners with their pets during the warmer months. You can have them off lead too although there are some areas near horses where it's better to keep them on lead. A small part of the beach is also closed to dogs for the summer months but most of the beach is open for them to run about on. At the Yr Orsaf cafe mentioned above dogs are welcome at the outside patio and a small section within the restaurant."
