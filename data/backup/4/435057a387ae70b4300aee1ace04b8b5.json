  "description": "This delightful Lancashire village is in a great location for exploring the scenery of the lovely Forest of Bowland and Ribble Valley . It's a very picturesque place with two village greens and lots of pretty little cottages lining the street. This walk from the village takes you to neighbouring Sawley where you can visit the historic Sawley Abbey. It then picks up a section of the Ribble Way to visit the worthy village of Gisburn. The walk starts in the village at the car park and visitor information centre. You then head south along the Skirden Beck and the River Ribble to Sawley. You can explore the impressive ruins and learn about their history courtesy of the English Heritage information panels. After exploring the abbey the route then picks up the Ribble Way and follows the waymarked trail east to visit Gisburn. From here you can return to Bolton By Bowland by bus or retrace your steps. There's also the option of turning it into a longer circular walk by heading to Paythorne to the north and then heading west along various country lanes and footpaths.",
