  "description": "This attractive Buckinghamshire village is part of the 'Chalfonts' along with Chalfont St Giles and Chalfont St Peter . There's some lovely Chilterns countryside, riverside trails and the local Little Chalfont Nature Park for walkers to explore. This circular walk from the village takes you along the River Chess to the nearby Chenies village and manor house. The walk starts at the Chalfont and Latimer train station where you can pick up the Chess Valley Walk . Follow the waymarked trail north and it will take you up to the river, passing through West Wood on the way. Follow the river path east and it will take you past Latimer to Chenies Bottom where you cross the river and head into Chenies village. Here you'll find the Tudor Chenies Manor House which is open to the public during the summer months. The route then heads south west past Old Hanging Wood before heading through Little Chalfont to return to the train station. You can extend the walk by heading a short distance south west of the station to visit Little Chalfont Nature Park . The lovely little park includes a rare wild flower meadow, old woodlands and relics of its past as a farm and a cherry orchard.
