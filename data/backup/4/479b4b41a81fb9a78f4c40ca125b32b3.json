  "description": "This Cambridgeshire market town is located in the River Great Ouse just east of Huntingdon. This circular walk from the town takes you along the river to visit the historic Houghton Mill before heading to the neighbouring villages of Hemingford Abbots and Hemingford Grey. Here you have the option of visiting Hemingford Grey Manor which dates from the 12th century. The interesting house and gardens are open to visitors. The walk starts on the river at Town Quay on the southern edge of the town. Here you can pick up the Ouse Valley Way and follow the waymarked trail west to Hoghton Mill. Here you will find a working 18th-century watermill with a tea room and lovely walking trails. The walk then crosses the river and heads across Hemingford Meadow to Hemingford Abbots. From here you continue east to Hemingford Grey before crossing the river on St Ives Bridge and and returning to the quay.",
