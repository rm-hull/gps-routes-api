  "description": "This circular walk explores Beckenham Place Park in the London Borough of Lewisham. It starts at Ravensbourne station and heads through the park's woodland, skirting the edge of the golf course. You return to the station, following a footpath along the Ravensbourne River, in the eastern section of the park. In the park you'll find 96 hectares (237 acres) of parkland including ancient woodland, a sensory garden and a Grade II listed mansion. It's also an excellent place for wildlife watching. Look out for a wide variety of birds including ring-necked parakeet, tawny owl, all three woodpeckers, blackcap, chiffchaff, goldcrest, spotted flycatcher, nuthatch and treecreeper. The park has wide areas of grassland where you can see wildflowers such as pignut, mouse-ear hawkweed, cat's-ear, autumn hawkbit, yarrow, common bird's-foot-trefoil and sheep's sorrel. The Capital Ring and Green Chain Walk both run through the park. You can pick up these trails to extend your walking in the area. Heading west will take you to Crystal Palace Park, while heading east will take you to Elmstead Woods .",
