  "description": "This walk takes you along the old disused railway line in the Northamptonshire village of King's Cliffe. It's an easy nature ramble along the old trackbed with woodland, countryside views and limestone scenery to enjoy. Afterwards you can enjoy a stroll around historic village where there's a Norman church, picturesque 17th century almshouses and nice views of the Willow Brook, a tributary of the River Nene. To continue your walking around King's Cliffe head west to visit Top Lodge in Fineshade Woods. The woods are a major local highlight with miles of great walking and cycling trails to try. You can follow the waymarked Jurassic Way through the woods from the western side of the settlement. If you head south west from the village you can follow a pleasant footpath along the Willow Brook to Blatherwycke Lake. There's some lovely waterside trails here with lots of birdlife to see on the water. The village is also located near the settlements of Stamford, Corby and Peterborough .",
