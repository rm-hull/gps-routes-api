  "description": "This circular walk takes you along a lovely section of the River Breamish in the Cheviots. Start the walk from the village of Ingram where there is a handy public car park. Follow country lanes west towards the hill of Brough Law where there are the remnants of a Bronze Age settlement. The route then climbs to Hartside Hill where there are more ancient settlements, a cairn and fine views over the area. From the hill summit the route descends to the River Breamish where you can pick up some nice riverside paths. Bridleway lead you west to High Cantle where the route turns east toward Linhope. Here you can take a small detour from the route to visit Linhope Spout waterfall. The waterfall is an impressive 60 foot (18m) chute of water landing into a deep plunge pool below. After passing Linhope the route returns to the car park in Ingram, passing Hartside on the way. For an aternative route around the valley try our Ingram Valley Walk which visits Little Dodd. You could also try the climb to The Cheviot for fabulous views over the valley and beyond.",
