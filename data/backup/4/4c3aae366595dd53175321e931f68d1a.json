  "description": "This walk visits the Meltham Mills Reservoir in Meltham in West Yorkshire. You can pick up footpaths on the eastern side of the town, just off Knowle Lane. These can be followed east through woodland to the small lake. There's then some nice paths to follow around the golf course which lies just to the south. It's a pretty area with nice views over the water to the surrounding woodland. You can also see water loving wildlife on the lake. Just to the north of the reservoir you can easily extend your walk in the adjacent Honley Woods . There's some peaceful trails here with good views from the high points in the woods.",
