  "description": "This super deer park in Nottingham is ideal for a short cycle or walk in delightful surroundings. The park is located on the western edge of the city centre and consists of an exquisite Elizabethan mansion surrounded by acres of parkland, woodland, lakes, formal gardens and the deer park. In the splendid Wollaton Hall you will find the Nottingham Natural History Museum, with Nottingham Industrial Museum located in the surrounding out-buildings. In the film The Dark Knight Rises Wollaton Hall was used as Wayne Manor, the extravagant home of Bruce Wayne. To extend your exercise you could pick up the Nottingham Canal and enjoy a cycle or walk to Langley Mill. The canal forms part of the longer circular Erewash Valley Trail which takes you on a super tour of the area on traffic free paths.",

It is famous for having a canal that extends into the grade II listed building, complete with resident narrow boats. There's also a large covered beer garden situated by the canal side which enables people to sit outside no matter the weather. You can find it at 48-52 Canal Street, NG1 7EH Also of interest is the Fellows, Morton & Clayton housed in the former canal museum. The 19th century pub has nice outdoor seating next to the canal. It's also on Canal Street near to the Canalhouse pub"
