  "description": "This Cumbrian market town is located in a lovely spot on the River South Tyne. The historic town has a charming cobbled main street with a market cross and many interesting old buildings including a 17th century pub of some note. It's also notable as one of the highest elevation towns in the country, at about 1000 feet (300 m) above sea level. This walk from the town uses sections of the South Tyne Trail and the Pennine Way to create a circular walk around the area. The walk starts in the town at the train station and follows the South Tyne Trail north west along the South Tynedale Railway and the River South Tyne. At Kirkhaugh you turn south west to pick up the Pennine Way and follow it to Whitley Castle Roman Fort. You then climb past Whitlow and Wanwoodhill to Harbut Lodge. This section rises to a height of over 1000 feet with fine views over the area. Just south of Harbut Lodge you cross the river to return to Alston.",
