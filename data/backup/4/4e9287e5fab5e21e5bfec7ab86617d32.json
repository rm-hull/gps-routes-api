  "description": "This town in Greater Manchester has some fine local waterside walks along the river and canal which run through the area. There's also a number of lovely reservoirs on the surrounding Pennine Moors to visit. This circular walk from the town visits some of the higlights of the area including the River Tame Valley Way, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, Stalybridge Country Park, Walkerwood Reservoir, Swineshaw Reservoir and Dovestone Reservoir. The walk starts just to the east of the train station where you can pick up the Tame Valley Way. Follow the waymarked trail south and it will take you along the river towards Millbrook where you can enjoy views of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. At Millbrook you head south east to visit Walkerwood Reservoir and the adjacent Stalybridge Country Park. You'll then head east past Brushes Reservoir to the two Swineshaw Reservoirs, using a section of the epic Pennine Bridleway. You can follow this waymarked cycling and walking trail north west across Slatepit Moor to Buckton Moor where you'll pass an old quarry and Buckton Castle. The route then bends round to visit the popular Dovestone Reservoir where you have the option of heading north to visit Saddleworth Moor or climbing to Dovestone Rocks for great views over the area. This route heads back west past Greenfield before returning to Mossley.",
