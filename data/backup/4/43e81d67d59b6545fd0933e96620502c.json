  "description": "This walk explores the Saltwells Nature Reserve in Dudley. The site is one of the UK's largest urban nature reserves covering 247 acres. The reserve is located on a former quarry and includes pleasant woodland trails with lots of wildlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for dragonflies around the ponds and various butterflies around the wildflowers in the summer months. There's also ponds, fascinating geology, a sculpture park and pretty bluebells in the spring months. You can extend the walk by heading north east to visit Netherton Reservoir and the Dudley Canal where there's some nice waterside trails to try.",
