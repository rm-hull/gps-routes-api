  "description": "A circular walk from Silverdale railway station, taking you to Eaves Wood, Elmslack, the coastal path and Silverdale Green. There's much to enjoy in this lovely area which forms part of the wider Arnside and Silverdale AONB. You'll experience woodland trails, a climb to a splendid viewpoint and great coastal views over Morceambe Bay. The walk starts at Silverdale railway station and heads west past Silverdale Golf Club. You then turn left along The Row and climb to the Eaves Wood Nature Reserve. Here you will find ancient woodland with limestone pavement supporting rare plants and wildlife. You can also climb to the Pepperpot monument and enjoy splendid views over the coast to Grange over Sands. The route then descends through Elmslack to the coast where you pick up a section of the Lancashire Coastal Way long distance trail. Here you'll pass the lovely Silverdale Cove where there's a little beach and splendid views across the bay. Follow the coast path south to Shore Road where you turn inland towards the village. It's a pretty village with a village school, library, two village halls and two churches. You can stop for refreshments at one of the pubs or cafes. The final section takes you across Silverdale Green to return to the train station. To extend the walk you can head east into the lovely Leighton Moss Nature Reserve , the largest reedbed in the north west. Also nearby are the splendid climbs to Arnside Knott and Warton Crag .",
