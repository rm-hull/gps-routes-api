  "description": "This old lead mining village is located in Denbighshire near the Clwydian Range and the border with Flintshire. This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the local area including Loggerheads Country Park, Moel Famau Country Park and Foel Fenlli. It uses sections of the epic Clwydian Way and Offa's Dyke Path to create the challenging circular route. The walk starts in the village where you can directly pick up the Clwydian Way. Follow the waymarked trail north and it will take you to Loggerheads Country Park. The park is a lovely place for a walk with dramatic limestone cliffs, wooded gorges and river views to enjoy. The route continues north and then turns west to Cilcain before turning south to climb to the splendid viewpoint at Moel Famau and the Jubilee Tower. Here you pick up the Offa's Dyke Path and follow it south to Bwlch Pebarra and the ancient fort at Foel Fenlli. The route continues east, passing Fron Hen and Lanferres before returning to the village. For more information on the village's history and landmarks see the helpful wikipedia page .",
