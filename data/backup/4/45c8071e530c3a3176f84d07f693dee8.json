  "description": "Explore some of the finest limestone pavement in the country on this climb to Hutton Roof Crags and Farleton Fell. The scenery is striking with boulders and unusual rock formations covering the landscape. You'll pass across Hutton Roof Crags and climb over Newbiggin Crags before reaching the high point at Farleton Knot. All the way there are magnificent views over the surrounding fells. The area is also a nature reserve with a wide variety of interesting flora and fauna. Look out for fly orchids, lily of the valley and dark red helleborine. Wildlife includes small tortoiseshell and brimstone butterflies with birdlife such as woodpecker, long-tailed tits, redwing, fieldfare and mistle thrush. You may also see roe deer. This circular walk starts in the village of Hutton Roof and follows the Limestone Link over Hutton Roof Crags and Newbiggin Crags before reaching the high point at Farleton Knott. From here there are fabulous views over the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales. The route then follows country lanes and other footpaths back to Hutton Roof. Hutton Roof Crags is located a couple of miles west of Kirkby Lonsdale. You could start the walk from here and follow the Limestone Link to the crags. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the Lune Valley Ramble and enjoy a riverside stroll along the River Lune. Also nearby is the beautiful Barbondale where there is a nice walk to Calf Top Hill and along the Barbon Beck .",
