  "description": "This North Northamptonshire town is located in a nice spot on the River Nene. This circular walk in the town explores the Irthlingborough Lakes and Meadows Nature Reserve. The reserve is part of the wider Nene Wetlands and includes some lovely waterside footpaths with lots of wildlife to see. Part of the walk runs along the Nene Way, a long distance walking trail running through the beautiful Nene Valley. You could extend the walk along the trail by heading north to visit neighbouring Ringstead or south to the lovely Irchester Country Park in Wellingborough. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Irthlingborough. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
