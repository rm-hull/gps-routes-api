The Wateringbury Stream passes through the grounds of the castle. It powered a fulling mill at the eastern end of the castle grounds. Mereworth Castle is owned by His Excellency Sayed Mohammed Mahdi Al-Tayer, a former Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary in London of the United Arab Emirates, who purchased it in 1976 for $1.2 million. It is not generally accessible to the public, but does open on rare occasions for guided tours."

  "description": "These large woods near Sevenoaks have miles of mountain bike trails and woodland walks to enjoy. The ancient woods consist of mixed broadleaf woodland, acid heath and some conifer plantations. The woods include wide bridleways with some steep descents and nice jumps to try. There's also good footpaths for walkers with lots of wildlife to look out for. The Wealdway long distance trail runs through the western edge of the forest so you can pick this up to extend your walk into the surrounding Kent countryside. Heading north takes you to Platt and\u00a0Wrotham Heath, while heading south takes you to West Peckham and the Grade II listed\u00a0Oxon Hoath manor house. Around here you can pick up the Greensand Way which runs to the south of the woods. Also nearby is Oldbury Hill where there are some good bridleways for mountain bikers and the pretty Ightham Mote which has good walking trails.",
