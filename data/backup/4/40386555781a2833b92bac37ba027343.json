The path passes through a variety of habitats, supporting a rich diversity of flora and fauna. Along the riverbanks, you\u2019ll encounter common wetland plants like yellow flag iris, water forget-me-not, and marsh marigold, which thrive in the damp soil. In the meadows, wildflowers such as oxeye daisy, red clover, and meadow buttercup add vibrant colours, especially in spring and summer. Patches of woodland provide shade, with trees like alder, willow, and oak dominating. Heathland areas near sections of the path are home to gorse, heather, and broom, giving the landscape a distinct character."

Place names such as \u201cEversley\u201d and \u201cSwallowfield\u201d hint at their medieval origins."

The meadows and woodland edges support smaller birds such as wrens, robins, and warblers. In summer, swallows and martins can be seen swooping over open fields and water in pursuit of insects."

The path\u2019s heathland sections provide a habitat for reptiles like slow worms and common lizards, particularly in sunnier spots. Butterflies, including common blue, speckled wood, and peacock, are abundant in summer, and dragonflies patrol near the riverbanks."

Spring sees a burst of colour with bluebells carpeting wooded areas and blossom appearing on blackthorn and hawthorn trees. In autumn, the path is rich with fungi, and trees like oak and beech display vivid colours. Winter brings a more subdued but equally striking atmosphere, with bare branches revealing the landscape\u2019s contours and increased chances of spotting overwintering birds such as redwings and fieldfares."

The historic pub was originally called The White Horse, but renamed after Queen Victoria planted an oak tree opposite the pub. There's a cosy log fire indoors while outside you can enjoy your meal in the garden area in finer weather. It's located in a lovely spot, close to the pretty village green on Church Lane. Postcode for your sat navs is RG40 4LS. In Farnborough there's The Prince of Wales to consider. The Victorian pub serves good home-cooked food and has a nice garden area. You can find them near the train stations just to the west of the trail as it passes through the Hampshire town. The address is 184 Rectory Rd, GU14 8AL. They are also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."

There's some easy lakeside trails, lots of wildlife and a lovely cafe to rest in here. Near Finchampstead you could take a small detour north from the path to visit Finchampstead Ridges. The attractive National Trust owned area includes woodland trails, heather, bracken and two tranquil ponds. Near the end of the route at Swallowfield you could extend your walk by visiting the nearby Wellington Country Park. The 350 acre park includes several nature trails where you can look out for the resident Red and Fallow deer. The miles of woodland trails in Bramshill Forest and the RSPB's Hazeley Heath are also located near here. In nearby Hook there's also some pleasant trails along the River Whitewater in the pretty Bassets Mead park on the eastern side of the town."
