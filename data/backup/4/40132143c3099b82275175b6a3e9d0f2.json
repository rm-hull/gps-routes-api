  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside and woodland surrounding the Oxfordshire town of Burford. The interesting medieval town is situated in the Cotswold Hills near to the Gloucestershire\u00a0border. There are nice footpaths to follow along the River Windrush and then into the farmland and woodland above the town. There is a good sized parking area just of the High Street in the town from which you can start your walk. Nearby is the Grade II Listed\u00a0Burford Methodist Church, built in the early 18th century. If you head east out of the town you can pick up a public footpath along the River Windrush to Widford. Here you turn north and cross the river and head to the pretty village of Swinbrook. The village includes the church\u00a0of\u00a0Saint Mary the Virgin\u00a0which dates from about 1200. After visiting Swinbrook the walk passes the site of the medieval village of Widford. St Oswald's church in Widford is\u00a0Early English Gothic\u00a0and dates from the 13th century. Widford was a substantial village in the\u00a0Middle Ages but only the 16th-century\u00a0manor house\u00a0and a few other houses remain today. The route heads north from Widford, visiting some small woodland areas before arriving at the village of Fulbrook with its Norman church. The final section returns you to the finish point at Burford. You can extend your walk by continuing east from Swinbrook to Minster Lovell. It's a nice stroll along the river with the option of exploring the atmospheric ruins of the 15th century Minster Lovell hall. Just to the west of Burford you can pick up the Donnington Way long distance footpath in Great Barrington. Also nearby is the attractive town of Witney where you can visit the pretty lake and Church Grenn on our Witney Circular Walk",
