      "caption": "Sutton valence castle and path up to it. Overlooking a strategic route to the coast, the original castle probably comprised an inner and an outer bailey and a protective barbican, with a three-storey high keep on its southern side. It was passed into the Marshal and de Montfort families, before being given by King Henry III to his half-brother William de Valence in 1265, from whom the castle takes its current name. It was abandoned in the early 14th century and fell into ruin. In the 21st century the castle is managed by English Heritage, and the remains of the keep are open to the public."

  "description": "This delightful Kent based village is located near Maidstone and Lenham . Sutton Valence is situated right on the Greensand Way , an epic long distance walk following the ridge of greensand rock through Surrey and Kent. Local walking highlights include the stunning grounds at Leeds Castle , which lies just to the north. This short walk in the village takes you to the historic Sutton Valence Castle . Here you can visit the ruins of this small Norman keep, built in the second half of the 12th century. You can then climb up to the castle and enjoy wonderful views over East Sussex and the Weald of Kent. The walk also takes you through the pleasant village centre where there are several old buildings including the photogenic almshouses. To continue your walking in the area follow the Greensand Way west to visit Linton Park . The beautiful 19th-century landscape park has some beautiful gardens and lovely views.",
