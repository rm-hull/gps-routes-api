  "description": "This walk visits two of the highlights of the Harrogate area at RHS Harlow Carr and the lovely Valley Gardens. The two gardens are only about 1 mile apart so it's easy to visit both in one day. The walk starts from Harlow Carr where you can explore the beautiful RHS gardens on a number of nice footpaths. There's 68 acres of streams, sculptures and displays to see on the site. Other highlights include a pretty lake, an arboretum, a kitchen garden and a wildflower meadow. The walk then heads east along Panorama Way, passing through the Pinewoods and the Pitch and Putt golf course to reach the nearby Valley Gardens where there are more wonderful flower displays. The 17 acre gardens also include woodland trails, several mineral springs and historic buildings including the Sun Pavilion and colonnades. The Harrogate Ringway long distance footpath passes along the western end of Harlow Carr. You can easily pick up the waymarked trail to extend your walking in the area. The circular trail takes you through the countryside, woodland and villages surrounding the town. Also of in Harrogate you can visit Plumpton Rocks. The 30 acre gardens are geologically significant with a series of Millstone Grit rock formations overlooking a tranquil lake.",
