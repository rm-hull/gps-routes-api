The trail is very popular and a major economic force in the area. At its inception it was feared that it may be a Trojan Horse for the restricted access lobby, but it has successfully worked alongside other outdoor activities for 30 years now.

  "description": "This is a fabulous long distance walking and cycling* route from Milngavie, north of Glasgow, to Fort William in the Scottish Highlands. There's stunning scenery to enjoy with Lochs, mountains, rivers and waterfalls all dotted along the route. The route begins just outside Glasgow at Milngavie and heads north through Mugdock Country Park before reaching Loch Lomond where you enjoy a fantastic waterside section along the shores of the loch with Ben Lomond mountain making a beautiful backdrop. You continue through Glen Falloch and Strathfillan, passing the lovely Falls of Falloch, Loch Tulla, Glen Orchy and crossing Rannoch Moor. The path then takes you through the stunning Glencoe, climbing the Devil\u2019s Staircase, before crossing the River Leven at the head of Loch Leven. The final section takes you past Lairigmor and Glen Nevis and finishes at Gordon Square in Fort William. The route is well signposted throughout. *For cyclists please be aware that while much of the route makes for fantastic cycling some sections are extremely challenging and are only suitable for experienced mountain bikers. Even then you will have to carry your bike over certain sections. Please see this discussion thread for more information. We've split up the route into several sections which can be walked in a day. Click on the links below to see a description, photos and a map for each section.",
