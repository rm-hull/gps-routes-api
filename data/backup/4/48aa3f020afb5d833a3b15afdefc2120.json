  "description": "This walk from Thurso to Scrabster offers a delightful mix of coastal and urban landscapes. Starting on the waterfront in Thurso, you'll head west to Victoria Walk, a scenic coastal path that provides breathtaking views over the Pentland Firth. On clear days, you can spot the Orkney Islands in the distance. This route then transitions to roadside pavements and coastal paths, making it accessible yet varied. The walk is enriched by the natural beauty of the area. Look out for seabirds like guillemots and fulmars along the cliffs and, in the waters below, seals and occasionally porpoises. The coastal vegetation includes hardy grasses, sea thrift, and heathers, which thrive in the windswept conditions. Upon reaching Scrabster, the working harbour adds a contrasting dynamic to the walk, with fishing boats and ferries creating a bustling atmosphere. The views here extend towards Holborn Head and beyond, making it a rewarding end point for a coastal exploration.",
