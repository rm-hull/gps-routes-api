  "description": "This route from Exmouth uses a section of the South West Coast Path and the Exmouth to Budleigh Salterton Railway Path to create a circular walk from the town. The route runs for a distance of just over 11 miles with nice coastal views on the first section before countryside scenery on the return leg. The route starts from Exmouth Docks where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it east to Orcombe Point. The spot is most westerly point of the Jurassic Coast and is marked with The Geoneedle sculpture. The route continues to Budleigh Salterton where there is a nice beach and lots of nice places to stop for a bite to eat. Walk north through the town to Knowle and you will soon come to the Exmouth to Budleigh Salterton Railway Path. You can follow the disused railway path west back to Exmouth, passing Littleham and Phear Park on the way.",
