  "description": "Latheronwheel Fairy Glen is located near the harbour in Latheronwheel, Caithness. The glen is a charming woodland area filled with whimsical \"fairy\" touches created by local volunteers. To reach it, you can park near the harbour and walk back into the glen, which follows the course of the woodland burn leading to the North Sea. The glen features enchanting details such as fairy doors, carved tree trunks, and tiny toadstool homes that delight visitors of all ages. The paths are mostly accessible, though there are some steep steps leading to viewpoints over the harbour and nearby cliffs. The surrounding woodland is rich in mosses and greenery, particularly vivid in autumn, and the glen\u2019s biodiversity includes small birds, insects, and seasonal blooms, making it a lovely spot for nature enthusiasts. To continue your walking in the area head south along the coast to Helmsdale where you can enjoy another pleasant riverside walk.",
