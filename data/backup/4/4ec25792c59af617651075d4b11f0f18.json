  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside to the south of Wrexham. On the way you'll enjoy riverside trails and a visit to the National Trust's Erddig Hall and Country Park. The walk starts at the public car park at Felin Puleston at the south western edge of the town, on the Ruabon Road. From here you can pick up public footpaths heading south and then east around Erdigg Park.The 1,200-acre estate is one of the highlights of the area. It surrounds the historic 18th century Erddig Hall and includes peaceful woodland and pretty gardens. The trails will then take you east past Marchwiel Hall before turning north to pass Marchwiel Reservoir. Eventually you come to the old King's Mills where you pick up the Clywedog Trail. This waymarked walking trail will take you west along the river to return you to the car park.",
