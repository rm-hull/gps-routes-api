The five-arched stone bridge probably dates back to the early 1700s; the pedestrian walkway was added not so long ago.  The castle dates from the late 11th-century, though was rebuilt in 1244. It is a Grade I listed building."

In 1994 there was a serious landslip that destroyed houses and necessitated major drainage and stabilization work. The post-glacial soil structure of the area is the reason for the instability."

This walk from the town takes you along the coastal path to St Dogmaels , Poppit Sands and Cemaes Head. There's lovely views of the River Teifi estuary and the bay along the way. The destination headland is also a nature reserve so bring your binoculars! The walk starts on the bridge in Cardigan close to the historic castle. From here you can follow a footpath along the River Teifi towards the village of St Dogmaels where you could stop to explore the ruins of the 12th century abbey.
