  "description": "Climb to this Iron Age hill fort and enjoy wonderful views over Marshwood Vale on this hilltop walk near Bridport. The walk starts from the roadside parking area shown on the google street view link below. The footpath to the hill is just up the road from here. The hill fort is over 2500 years old and is rich in attractive plantlife. From the 252 m (827 ft) summit the views are wonderful with the English Channel and Lyme Bay visible on a clear day. It's a nice elevated path which takes you to the Bell Stone before returning the same way. A local cycle route runs past Eggardon hill so you could follow this from nearby Powerstock to reach the hill. National Cycle Network Route 2 could also be followed from Bridport to Uploders before picking up the local route to Eggardon. It's a nice ride along a series of pretty country lanes. You could also start the walk from Powerstock and follow good footpaths to the hill. The Jubilee Trail runs just to the east of the hill. You could pick up the waymarked trail to continue your walking in the area. Just to the north there are some nice trails on the Powerstock Common Nature Reserve.",

The historic village includes an ancient church and a noteworthy 15th century, thatched pub. To the south there's Littlebredy which is something of a hidden gem.
