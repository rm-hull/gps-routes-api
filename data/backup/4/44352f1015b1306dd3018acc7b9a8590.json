  "description": "Enjoy a lovely coastal walk around the headland of Little Orme on this route on Llandudno Bay. The area is not as popular as its bigger brother of Great Orme, but is still a very worthy walk in its own right. You'll climb to a height of 141 metres (463 ft) with wonderful views over Penrhyn Bay and the surrounding area. On the headland you will find limestone grassland and exposed limestone cliffs formed over 320 million years ago. It's great for flora and fauna with breeding fulmars and rock-rose orchids to look out for on the way. The walk starts from the Premier Inn on Colwyn Road just to the east of Llandudno. You could also start from the town and just follow the road east for about a mile. On your left you'll see a gate with footpath signs and an information board. Head through the gate and pick up the trails to take you up on to Little Orme. You can follow the paths around the headland to form a short circular walk. The area also includes the NWWT's Rhiwledyn Nature Reserve where you can look out for a variety of sea birds and the seals in Angel Bay. This walk uses a section of the North Wales Path to explore the headland. To extend your walk you can follow the path west to Llandudno and Great Orme Country Park .",
