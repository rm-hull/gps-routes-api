  "description": "This is a circular walk through the countryside and woodland around the Yorkshire town of Doncaster. The Doncastrian Way walk includes lovely waterside stretches along the River Don and the River Torne, while there are also pleasant woodland sections through Edlington and Wadworth Wood. The path passes the villages of Wadworth, New Rossington and Auckley. For a shorter route try our Doncaster River Walk which runs from Doncaster to Conisbrough along the Don. Here you can visit the impressive Conisbrough Viaduct and enjoy fine views from the top of structure. There's also the picturesque weirs at Sprotbrough Falls to enjoy in this area. The walk forms part of the Don Valley Way, a long distance route which can be followed all the way to Sheffield.",
