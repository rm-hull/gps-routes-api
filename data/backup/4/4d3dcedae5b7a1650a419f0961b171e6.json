  "description": "This walk links the towns of Grimsby and Louth and celebrates the Silver Jubilee of the Grimsby Louth group of the Ramblers Association. The walk begins on the outskirts of Grimsby and follows footpaths, bridleways and country lanes to Louth. You will pass through peaceful woodland and the rolling Lincolnshire Wolds while also visiting the pretty villages of Brigsley, Ashby Cum Fenby and Wold Newton. Walk highlights include the historic churches at Brigsley and Ashby Cum Fenby, with the former dating back to the 11th century. The final section of the walk through Hubbard's Hills Park and along the River Lud is also particularly lovely. You can continue your walking in the area by picking up the Louth Canal and following it to the Lincolnshire coast.",
