  "description": "Enjoy a short walk through the pretty Coombs Dale on this route from the village of Stoney Middleton. There's some nice limestone scenery, attractive woodland, and nice views over the surrounding Peak District countryside. Just to the west of the village centre you can pick up a footpath heading south to Coombs Dale. Here you follow a tree lined bridleway through the dale. You head towards Deep Rake at the southern end of the dale. Here you have the option of heading a short distance to the west and enjoying a walk along Longstone Edge. The limestone ridge runs from east to west for about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi), from the village of Calver to the River Wye at Monsal Dale. There's fabulous over the White Peak from the 395 metres (1,296 ft) high point. You could also head north east to Calver Peak and the village of Calver. This walk follows other footpaths back through the dale before returning to Stoney Middleton. Back in the village you can enjoy refreshments at the walker friendly Lover's Leap cafe or the Moon Inn pub. The village is located just to the south of Eyam where you can pick up a number of good walking trails. You could also head a short distance to the east to pick up the long distance Derwent Valley Heritage Way and enjoy riverside paths along the River Derwent.",
