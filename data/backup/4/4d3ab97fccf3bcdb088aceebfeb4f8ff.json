  "description": "This circular walk visits the Galway Wind Park in the vast Seecon Forest near Oughterard. The expansive site is home to Ireland's largest on shore windfarm. There's a series of walking trails to follow around the park with fine views of the Connemara hills and the Cloosh Valley. You can start the walk from the car parking area on the north eastern corner of the park. Then pick up the trails towards Seecon Lough with woodland trails and fine views of the large windmills. Head into nearby Oughterard and you can continue your walking at Lough Corrib , the largest lake within the Republic of Ireland.",
