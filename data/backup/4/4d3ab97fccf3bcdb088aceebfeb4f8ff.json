You can start the walk from the car parking area on the north eastern corner of the park. Then pick up the trails towards Seecon Lough with woodland trails and fine views of the large windmills. Head into nearby Oughterard and you can continue your walking at Lough Corrib, the largest lake within the Republic of Ireland.",
