  "description": "This circular walk visit the impressive Cynghordy Viaduct in Carmarthenshire. The route runs for just over 2 miles with some small climbs and fine views of the surrounding hills and countryside. The walk starts from Cynghordy railway station on the Heart of Wales Line about 46 miles north east of Swansea. Near to the station is the grade II listed 18-arch viaduct which carries the route across the Afon Bran valley on a gentle curve. It is 102 feet (31 m) high and 850 ft (259 m) long and was built from sandstone and brick in 1868. From the station you can follow public footpaths heading north and then east to the structure. You can then pick up nice country lanes running along the Afon Bran before turning south past Cynghordy Hall. These will eventually bend round to return you to the station where the walk finishes. To continue your walking in the area you could enjoy a climb to The Sugar Loaf. It's a popular viewpoint and picnic spot located a couple of miles north east of the viaduct.",

There's also the ruined 13th century castle and some nice trails along the River Towy to try. The Heart of Wales Line Trail passes through the area. The 143 mile trail explores the Heart of Wales Railway Line, a wonderful rural railway running between Swansea and Shrewsbury. The trail visit several train stations, old railway lines and other photogenic railway viaducts. You could follow it south for a few miles to visit Llandovery. Heading north east would take you into the expansive Crychan Forest."
