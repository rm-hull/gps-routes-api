  "description": "This walk explores Clock Face Country Park in St Helens on Merseyside. The park is located on the site of the old Clock Face Colliery. It's been converted into a lovely open space with pleasant footpaths, a picturesque pond and picnic areas. The park is linked with the Sutton Manor Park which lies just to the west. You can easily extend the walk by visiting the park where you'll find the photogenic Dream Sculpture and more nice trails. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area you could head a couple of miles north to Colliers Moss Common . This former industrial site has been converted into a\u00a0tranquil green space with woods, lagoons and lots of wildlife to see.",
