  "description": "These woods in Bedfordshire have walking trails, a BMX trail and mountain bike trails to try. In one half of the woods you will find the cycling trails and in the other peaceful woodland footpaths. There's good facilities as well with a good sized car park, picnic areas and a cafe. At the northern section of the woods you will find Chicksands Bike Park. The park has a range of trails for all abilities. See the video below to give you an idea of what you can expect to find at the site! The woods are in a good location for extending your walking. You could pick up the John Bunyan Trail and head to the nearby Chicksands Wood. The woods have nice wide trails and pretty bluebells in the spring. You can also pick up the Greensand Ridge Walk and visit Maulden Woods near Clophill. Here you will find more walking trails taking you through semi-natural broadleaf woodland, acidic grassland and conifer plantations.",

      "content": "The Stone Jug in the nearby village of Clophill is a fine place to go for some post walk refreshments. It's a place of some historic note having been converted to a pub from a 16th century building. It's name may have something to do with the local quarry stone which the building is mostly constructed from. The pub is nestled on a quiet rural lane has a rear decking area which in the summer months catches all the afternoon and early evening sun - perfect for a relaxing sit down. During the colder months you can sip a mulled wine and relax in the attractive interior beside one of the many fires. You can find the pub in the village at 10 Back St with a postcode of MK45 4BY for your sat navs. To the south east there's the town of Shefford where you could visit The Railway Steamer. They serve a fine Sunday lunch and have a lovely garden area where you can hire garden pods and sit out even if the weather is not so good. You can find them on Clifton Road at postcode SG17 5AH for your sat navs."

      "content": "Near to Clophill you will find the interesting Cainhoe Castle which is worth a visit if you have time. The hill is the site of the a former 11th-century Norman castle but today only the turf-covered mound remains, with earthwork banks outlining the bailey enclosure. It's a nice climb to the top though and there are good views of the surrounding countryside from the elevated position of the site. There is a public footpath from the High Street in Clophill, opposite Town Shott, heading east out to the castle. The field has permissive access, so visitors can explore freely. The Clophill and Haynes Circular Walk starts in the nearby village and explores the local countryside, passing just to the west of the woods on the way. Just to the south of Clophill there's Silsoe where you can enjoy easy trails around Wrest Park. There's 92 acres of landscaped early eighteenth-century gardens to explore here. You can also enjoy a pleasant stroll around Silsoe village where there are a number of historic properties associated with the park estate. For more walking ideas in the area see the Bedfordshire Walks page."
