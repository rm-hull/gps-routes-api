  "description": "These woods in Bedfordshire have walking trails, a BMX trail and mountain bike trails to try. In one half of the woods you will find the cycling trails and in the other peaceful woodland footpaths. There's good facilities as well with a good sized car park, picnic areas and a cafe. At the northern section of the woods you will find Chicksands Bike Park . The park has a range of trails for all abilities. See the video below to give you an idea of what you can expect to find at the site! The woods are in a good location for extending your walking. You could pick up the John Bunyan Trail and head to the nearby Chicksands Wood . The woods have nice wide trails and pretty bluebells in the spring. You can also pick up the Greensand Ridge Walk and visit Maulden Woods near Clophill. Here you will find more walking trails taking you through semi-natural broadleaf woodland, acidic grassland and conifer plantations.",
