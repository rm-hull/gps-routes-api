  "description": "Explore the Wallington estate on this walk in Northumberland. Here you will find a country house and pretty gardens. The grounds are lovely and include lakes, woodland, parkland and a beautiful walled garden. The estate is located about 12 miles west of Morpeth. To extend your walking in the area you could visit Hartburn Glebe where there's lovely river walk, woodland trails and lots of wildlife to look out for. Just to the south east of the hall you will find Shaftoe Crags where there's interesting rock formations and fine views from the cliff top. Bolam Lake Country Park with its lovely waterside walks is also nearby.",
