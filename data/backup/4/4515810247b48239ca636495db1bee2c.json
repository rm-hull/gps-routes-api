For walkers there's some attractive local woodland and hill climbs with wonderful views over the moors to enjoy. This circular walk from the village takes you up onto Battersby Moor and Ingleby Moor to the east of the settlement. Here you visit Ingleby Bank, the Otter Hills, Turkey Nab and Tidy Brown Hill where there are some fine views over the countryside to Captain Cook's Monument. The route then descends west to Ingleby Beck and Ingleby Manor before returning to the village.",
