  "description": "Enjoy miles of super cycling and walking trails in this large deer park in London. Richmond Park is the largest of London's Royal Parks at 955 hectares or 2,360 acres. For cyclists National Cycle Network Route 4 and the circular Tamsin Trail run through the park on roads and well surfaced off road tracks. The Tamsin Trail - The route below shows this cycling and walking trail which runs around the perimeter of the park on lovely resurfaced paths. It's a very popular route as it provides a great, largely traffic free ride in London. On it you'll pass woodland and ponds with a section along the pretty Beverley Brook. Cycles are available for hire near Roehampton Gate and, at peak times, near Pembroke Lodge in the north west corner of the park. If you're on foot you could head to the beautiful Isabella Plantation. Here you'll find a 40 acre woodland garden with evergreen azaleas, ponds, Rhododendrons and Camellias. There's also the delightful Pen Ponds. The ponds are divided by a causeway which you can walk along and look out for a variety of birdlife. If you'd like to continue your walk you could pick up the Capital Ring which runs through the park. One good option is to follow the trail to the nearby Wimbledon Common. Or you could head to Ham House at the western side of the park.",
