  "description": "This circular walk explores the Benacre National Nature Reserve in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB. On the way you'll visit the tranquil Benacre Broad, Benacre Beach and the ruined church at the little hamlet of Covehithe. The extensive reserve also includes open water lagoons, reed beds and a large variety of wildlife. Look out for marsh harrier, bearded reedling, water rail and bittern as you make your way through this lovely area. The walk starts in the little village of Benacre and follows the Suffolk Coast Path east to the beach. You then follow the beach south to the broad where you can look out for a number of water loving birds from the waterside hide. You continue along the beach before following a country lane to Covehithe where you will pass the noteworthy St Andrews Church. The 14th century ruined church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The route then follows the trail north west towards Wrentham before turning north to return to Benacre.",

      "content": "The Kessingland to Southwold Walk passes through the reserve and is a nice way to extend your walking in the vicinity. Near here you can pick up the circular Blythburgh Walk and enjoy a walk through the Walsberwick Nature Reserve. If you followed the Blyth river west from the settlement you will soon come to the neighbouring town of Halesworth. This town has some interesting history with a walk down the central Thoroughfare highly recommended. The pedestrianised area includes many buildings dating back to the sixteenth century. If you head north along the coast path it will take you to the major town of Lowestoft. For more walking ideas in the area see the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Walks page."
