There are trails for walkers, cyclists and for the disabled. Leicester relied on wells and springs for drinking water, like most large cities and towns, until the 19th century when the cholera epidemics in 1831,1832 and 1847 forced Parliament into action. In 1847, an Act of Parliament allowed a private company to be formed to supply the city. By 1854, it had already built Thornton reservoir, together with a treatment plant and distribution mains. Cropston Reservoir was added in 1866, and Swithland Reservoir in 1896."

    "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking around this pretty reservoir in Thornton, Leicestershire. There is a well surfaced track running along the waterside for just over 2 miles. The water is surrounded by some lovely countryside and woodland. There are good facilites with a parking area, visitor centre and picnic areas. There is also a sculpture trail to follow and a variety of wildfowl to look out for on the water. On the northern side of the reservoir there is the option of extending your walk into the adjacent Browns Wood. The Leicestershire Round also runs past the reservoir so you could pick this up and extend your walk to the nearby Bagworth Heath Woods. The Ivanhoe Way also runs past the reservoir so you could follow this north through the Charnwood Forest to Blackbrook Reservoir. The Sence Valley Forest Park is also nearby and has miles of good woodland cycling and walking trails to try. Next to the woods is the adjacent Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Wood which was planted in 2012 to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. It's another pleasant area with woodland trails and a lake in the centre.",
