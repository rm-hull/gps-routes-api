  "description": "These splendid ancient woods near Peterborough have miles of woodland walking trails to try. You can start the walk from the car park off the A47, just east of Wansford (postcode PE8 6NN). The area is a hidden gem with 520 acres of ancient woodland to explore.  The extensive flora includes beech, birch, field maple, bluebells, primroses, celandines, violets and wood anemones, wild strawberries and garlic. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for including deer, cuckoo, foxes, red kites and buzzards. The woods contains more plant and insect species than most other woods in this country. Bedford Purlieus is located just to the west of the lovely riverside village of Wansford. The Nene Way long distance footpath runs through the village so you could pick this up to extend your walk.",
