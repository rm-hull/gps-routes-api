  "description": "This is a walking and cycling route around the beautiful Bewl Water reservoir near Lamberhurst. The route runs alongside the reservoir for most of the way though there is an inland section on quiet country lanes around Tolhurst. It runs for about 12.5 miles with great views of the High Weald AONB. Bike hire is available during the summer months from the Boat House Bistro. The area is also great for wildlife watching with Goldcrests, Long Tailed Tits, Wagtails, Skylarks and Lapwings in the woodland. Also look out for Kingfishers, Herons and the Great Crested Grebe on the water. Please note the route is not always open for cyclists during the winter months -  please check the Bewl Water website before setting off. The Sussex Border Path long distance trail runs right past the reservoir so you could pick this up if you wanted to continue your walk. Just to the west of the reservoir is the town of Wadhurst which makes a nice alternative start point to the walk. It's a short walk through the countryside from the town to the lake and there's a nice choice of pubs for refreshments afterwards. Just to the east of the lake you will find Bedgebury Forest. The 2000 acre woods are an excellent place for extending your cycle or walk. There's miles of mountain bike trails with jumps and fun descents. For walkers there's the delightful Bedgebury Pinetum with 10,000 trees growing across 320 acres. The National Trust owned Scotney Castle is also nearby and well worth a visit.",
