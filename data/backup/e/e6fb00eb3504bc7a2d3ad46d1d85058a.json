  "description": "Enjoy a climb to the summit of Caerphilly Mountain and a walk across Caerphilly Common on this circular route in South Wales. You can park at the Caerphilly Mountain Snack Bar car park on Mountain Road to start your walk. From here you can pick up the tracks to take you to the 271 metres (889\u00a0ft) summit where there are fabulous views over the town and Caerphilly Castle. There are a few different paths to choose from. Most of them are good wide trails though they can get muddy in winter. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the snack bar. The Taff Ely Ridgeway Walk passes the common so you can pick up this long distance trail to continue your walk. The waymarked trail starts on the common and will take you to Garth Hill , the Ely Valley and the Taff Vale. The Glamorgan Ridgeway Walk also passes the mountain. It's a long distance ridge top walk which takes you to Llantrisant forest and Margam Country Park . The splendid 13th century Caerphilly Castle also has some nice footpaths around the its\u00a0network of moats and dams. There's also the unusual turquoise coloured Brombil Reservoir on the fringe of the park.",
