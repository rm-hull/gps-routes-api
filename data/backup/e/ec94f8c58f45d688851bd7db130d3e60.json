Ballyconnell is situated along the Woodford River (Irish: Sruth Gr\u00e1inne, meaning \"the Gravelly Stream\" or \"the Gravelly River\"), which forms part of the Shannon\u2013Erne Waterway, a boating route that was reopened in 1993. The river is also referred to in English as the River Gr\u00e1inne or the Graine River. A section of the Woodford River at Ballyconnell has been canalised, known as the Woodford Canal. The town lies at the foot of Slieve Rushen mountain and is approximately one mile from the border between County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland. This geographical positioning underscores Ballyconnell's historical significance as a crossing point and a connector between regions."

Ballyconnell is an anglicisation of the Irish name B\u00e9al \u00c1tha Conaill, which translates to \"the entrance to Conall's ford.\" This ford was a shallow crossing over the River Gr\u00e1inne, now known as the Woodford River, and historically served as a border crossing for travellers moving between Ulster and Connacht. The ford's formation was due to silt and gravel deposits washed down from the nearby Slieve Rushen mountain by the Tanyard Stream, which flows into the Gr\u00e1inne about 20 yards upriver from Ballyconnell Bridge on the western edge of the town."
