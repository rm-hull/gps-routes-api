  "description": "This walk follows the Grand Union Canal from Uxbridge to Slough. It's about a 7 mile walk along the flat towpath so easy to complete in an afternoon. Uxbridge town is located in West London and accessible on the tube system as the western terminus for branches of the\u00a0Metropolitan\u00a0and\u00a0Piccadilly\u00a0lines of the\u00a0London Underground. The walk starts from the canal bridge at Uxbridge Moor, just to south west of the tube station and bus station. From here you head south to Little Britain where there is an aqueduct and a number of lakes. Around here you can also link up with the Colne Valley Way . This waymarked footpath branches of from the canal and provides an opportunity for exploring the Colne Valley further. This route turns west from Yiewsley, passing a series of lakes and Shreding Green before coming in to Slough where the route finishes.",
