The area encompasses both dry and wet heathland, each supporting distinct plant communities. In the dry heathland, visitors can observe species such as wavy hair-grass, bilberry, bell heather, and ling, with occasional oak, rowan, and silver birch trees. The wet heathland areas, characterized by shallow peat soils, are home to plants like wood horsetail, marsh thistle, water blinks, marsh violet, and notable colonies of bog asphodel. Additionally, the site supports uncommon species such as cowberry and chickweed wintergreen."

Mammals like red deer, roe deer, and sika deer inhabit the surrounding moorland. In terms of invertebrates, the heath supports species such as the green hairstreak and holly blue butterflies, as well as the green tiger beetle and the solitary bee Colletes succinctus."

  "description": "Brimham Rocks is a National Trust owned site with a collection of fascinating rock formations. You can explore the labyrinth of paths while enjoying fabulous views over Nidderdale. This circular walk starts from the on site car park where you can pick up trails heading around Brimham Moor where there's pretty heather to see. The trails will take you around the ancient rocks which are hundreds of millions of years old. It's also great for wildlife with a number of bird boxes attracting Blue Tits and Redstarts to nest in the area. The site is located near Pateley Bridge and on the Nidderdale Way walking route so there is scope for continuing your walk through the Nidderdale AONB.",

This will take you north to the expansive Gouthwaite Reservoir where there is a lovely waterside trail to pick up. For cyclists the epic Way of the Roses and National Cycle Network Route 688 pass through the site. You could follow the signed route from Pateley Bridge to the rocks. Just to the south there's the worthy villages of Summerbridge and Dacre Banks. There's some nice river walks along the River Nidd and a fine 18th century pub to visit in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nidderdale Walks page."
