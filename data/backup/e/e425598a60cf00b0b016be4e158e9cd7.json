    "description": "Brimham Rocks is a National Trust owned site with a collection of fascinating rock formations. You can explore the labyrinth of paths while enjoying fabulous views over Nidderdale. This circular walk starts from the on site car park where you can pick up trails heading around Brimham Moor where there's pretty heather to see. The trails will take you around the ancient rocks which are hundreds of millions of years old. It's also great for wildlife with a number of bird boxes attracting Blue Tits and Redstarts to nest in the area. The site is located near Pateley Bridge and on the Nidderdale Way walking route so there is scope for continuing your walk through the Nidderdale AONB.",
