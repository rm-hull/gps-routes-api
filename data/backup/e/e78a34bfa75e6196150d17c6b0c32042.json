  "description": "This circular walk visits the historic windmill in the Derbyshire village of Heage. The Grade II listed mill was built in the 1790s and restored to working order in 2002. You can enjoy a guided tour and learn all about the history of the tower mill.\nThere's also pleasant footpaths to follow around the countryside surrounding the mill with views of the lovely rolling hills. The windmill is located close to the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site where you can visit other local historical sites including the Cromford Canal and the splendid Crich Tramway Village .",
