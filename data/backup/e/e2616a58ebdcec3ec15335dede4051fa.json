  "description": "Explore this area of lowland heath on this pleasant walk near Leominster. There's miles of footpaths to follow across the common with lovely views over the surrounding Herefordshire countryside from the high points. Woodland trails can also be found in the adjacent Oaker Coppice and Croft Wood. You can extend the walk by visiting the nearby Croft Ambrey at Croft Castle. The National Trust owned Iron Age Hill Fort affords wonderful views towards the Welsh Mountains. Just to the east is the splendid Berrington Hall. There's some lovely trails to follow around the parkland and gardens surrounding the fine Georgian mansion. The Mortimer Trail also runs past the common. You can pick it up to visit Mortimer Forest and the town of Ludlow. In nearby Leominster you can enjoy trails through the lovely valley of the River Lugg.",
