  "description": "This large area of open grassland near Epping Forest has miles of walking trails to try. With its nice grassy paths, wildflowers and water features it's one of the best open spaces in London. On the flats you will find gorse, broom, woodland and ponds. It's a popular area with dog walkers and bird watchers. You can also bring your bike to the park and enjoy a ride on one of the birdle paths. London Cycle Network routes 12 and 155 run past the flats to the south. You can follow these routes from nearby Ilford or Stratford. The flats are well known for hosting a popular weekly parkrun. It's a 5km course taking place on Saturday mornings at 9:00 am. There's a car park off Centre Road where you can start the walk. Heading east will take you across the flats to the lovely Alexandra Lake. You can then follow the Epping Forest Centenary Walk back  to the western side of the park where you will find the Jubilee Pond. Look out for wildlife including meadow pipits and skylarks on your walk. You can easily visit the area by public transport. Wanstead Park station is a two minute walk to the park. It's easy to extend your walk by heading north along the Epping Forest Centenary Walk and visiting Bush Wood and Wanstead Park. The park has a splendid 3 mile trail taking you around woodland, parkland, two ponds and an Ornamental canal. Just to the east you can follow a waterside cycling and walking path along the River Roding .",
