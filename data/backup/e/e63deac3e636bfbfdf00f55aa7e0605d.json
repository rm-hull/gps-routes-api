This pretty set of cottages, with an excellent view of Mount's Bay and out to sea, were built to house the Coastguard in an attempt to prevent, or at least make more difficult, the smuggling trade which was rife around this area of West Cornwall. It was only a short distance to scrabble over the rocks down to the cove, which was behind me and to the left as I took this picture. Nowadays it is possible to hire out these cottages as a holiday let (or perhaps do some smuggling of your own !!)"

They can be found high above Bessy's Cove, in the Prussia Cove area of the Cornish coast path. The cove is known for the 18th-century ship-wrecker and smuggler John Carter, also known as the \"King of Prussia\". Evidence of smuggling can be inferred by the building of the terrace of seven listed cottages overlooking Coule's Cove and Mount's Bay."

She was on her way to be broken up when she ran aground on the rocks, and the memorial marks this spot. The memorial itself is actually wood from the ship itself."

  "description": "This walk takes you along a section of the South West Coast Path from Praa Sands to Prussia Cove and Cudden Point on the Cornwall coast. The walk starts from the car park at Praa Sands where you'll find a wonderful mile long sandy beach. From here you head west along the waymarked footpath to Kenneggy Cliff and beach before coming to Prussia Cove. It's a very pretty area with a series of little coves and several holiday cottages. From here it is a short walk on to Cudden Point a prominent headland, owned by the National Trust. The area is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and includes some interesting geology and some rare butterfly species. To continue your walking in the area head east from the car park and you can visit Porthleven on the Porthleven to Praa Sands Coastal Walk. The village is another lovely place for a walk with the National Trust's Penrose Estate and the large freshwater lake at Loe Bar major local attractions.",
