The remains of an adit constructed in the early years of the 20th century with a view to extracting the silica-rich rhyolite rock for use as 'china stone', which was an additive for the production of high-quality porcelain ware. A common alternative was calcined flint, which was a pure silica. Fortunately, the activities caused great outrage, and the Town Council purchased the mineral rights to the mountain so that a recurrence was impossible"

  "description": "This walk takes you along the elevated Jubilee Path above Penmaenmawr on the North Wales coast. The path was constructed in 1887 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. You can start the walk from the parking area located at the end of Mountain Lane. The trail then heads north west before bending round to the east and creating a circular loop around Foel Lus. Along the way there's wonderful views towards the sea and the mountains of the Snowdonia National Park. The route runs for about 1.5 miles but you have the option of following a path up to Foel Fras if you have time. The longer Sychnant Pass Walk uses part of the trail to visit some of the other hills and mountains in the region. It starts just to the east at the car park near the Pensychnant Conservation Centre and visits Capelulo, Maen Esgob and Waen Gyrach. The route then picks up the trail and climbs to Foel Lus before heading back to the car park.",
