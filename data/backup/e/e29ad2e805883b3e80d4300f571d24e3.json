A common alternative was calcined flint, which was a pure silica. Fortunately, the activities caused great outrage, and the Town Council purchased the mineral rights to the mountain so that a recurrence was impossible"

  "description": "This walk takes you along the elevated Jubilee Path above Penmaenmawr on the North Wales coast. The path was constructed in 1887 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. You can start the walk from the parking area located at the end of Mountain Lane. The trail then heads north west before bending round to the east and creating a circular loop around Foel Lus. Along the way there's wonderful views towards the sea and the mountains of the Snowdonia National Park. The route runs for about 1.5 miles but you have the option of following a path up to Foel Fras if you have time. The longer Sychnant Pass Walk uses part of the trail to visit some of the other hills and mountains in the region. It starts just to the east at the car park near the Pensychnant Conservation Centre and visits Capelulo, Maen Esgob and Waen Gyrach. The route then picks up the trail and climbs to Foel Lus before heading back to the car park.",

Near here you can also visit the Penmaenmawr Quarry, which is another nice place for a walk in the area. Just to the east of the path there's the small village of Capelulo where you'll find The Fairy Glen Hotel. They serve good food and have an outdoor area if the sun is shining. You can find them on the Conway Old Rd at postcode LL34 6SP for your sat navs."

It uses part of the North Wales Path to explore the area and climb to the nearby Conwy Mountain. You could also enjoy a climb to Foel Fras or visit the stunning Aber Falls in Abergwyngregyn.  Just to the south is the delightful village of Rowen. The village is considered one of the prettiest villages in Wales and a real hidden gem. The climb to Tal Y Fan, in the Carneddau mountains, is often started from here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
