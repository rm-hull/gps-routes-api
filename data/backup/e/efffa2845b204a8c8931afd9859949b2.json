  "description": "This circular walk visits two of the higlights of Ilkley Moor and Burley Moor in West Yorkshire. The walk starts from the Cow and Calf parking area on Hangingstone Road, just to the south east of the town of Ilkley. From here you can pick up footpaths onto the moor, taking you to the famous 'Cow and Calf', a large rock formation consisting of an outcrop and boulder, also known as Hangingstone Rocks. The distinctive rocks are made of millstone grit and are so named because one is large, with the smaller one sitting close to it, like a cow and calf. From here you head west to meet up with the Backstone Beck. A nice footpath runs south along the beck to take you to the Twelve Apostles stone circle. The bronze age stones are an impressive sight, set in an elevated position on Burley Moor, nearly 400 metres above sea level. The circle originally had between 16 and 20 stones, but it is now reduced to 12 stones with a diameter of about 15 metres. After exploring the stones the route continues east across Burley Moor to the pretty Lower Lanshaw Dam. The path passes along the northern end of the water before linking up with the Ebor Way long distance footpath. This will then take you in a north west direction, leading you back to the car park and the finish point of the walk. Here you can enjoy well earned refreshments at the popular Cow and Calf pub. For an alternative circular walk see the Ilkley Moor Walk which heads west across the moor to visit Cranshaw Thorn Hill and Whetstone Gate. To extend the walk you could follow the Ebor Way into Ilkley and enjoy a riverside walk along the River Wharfe. See the Ilkley to Addingham Walk for more details.",

The village itself is well worth exploring with a delightful village green and some historic old buildings on the Main Street. It's located just a couple of miles north east of the rocks.
