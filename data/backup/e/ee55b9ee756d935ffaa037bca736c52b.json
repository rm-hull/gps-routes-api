This is a remarkably attractive structure considering it is made out of concrete blocks ! The blocks are huge, typically 5ft x 3ft x 2ft, but varying to allow for the tapered columns. According to (not necessarily terribly reliable) research on the internet, it is 108ft to the underside top of the arches from ground level. There are 12 arches in total, each one spanning 60ft. Of these 12, four arches actually span the river (not 6 as you will find reported elsewhere). The engineers were R. Church & William Robert Galbraith and the bridge was constructed between 1904 and 1908."

  "description": "This beautiful trail takes you through the Tamar Valley AONB from Tamerton Foliot in Devon to Launceston in Cornwall. You start by heading north towards the Lopwell area of natural beauty where you will cross the River Tavy. You'll pass through the lovely Lopwell Dam Nature Reserve with habitats including mudflats, freshwater marsh, wildflower meadow, scrub-grassland, saltmarsh and semi-natural woodland. The route then continues north towards Calstock joining the River Tamar for a splendid waterside stretch through Gunnislake and Luckett. You then leave the river heading through Milton Abbot before crossing the river again at Dunterton and proceeding to the finish at Launceston.",
