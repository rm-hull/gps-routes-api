  "description": "This large open space near Sowerby Bridge has some nice footpaths to try. The area includes heather moorland and pockets of woodland with lots of wildlife to look out for. It's particularly lovely in late summer when the area is covered in purple heather. The moor is surrounded by a number of pubs so you can easily enjoy refreshments after your walk. There's a car park at the north eastern end of the moor near Norland village. From here you can pick up the paths across the moor. Look out for wildlife including grouse and little owl on the way. The moor is in an elevated position with the high point reaching 932 feet (284\u00a0m) at the trig point at the southern end. From here there are great views to the surrounding hills and towns. Norland is also home to a annual\u00a0scarecrow\u00a0festival. It takes place around the first weekend in September. The Calderdale Way long distance path crosses the moor so you can extend your walk along the waymarked trail. Just to the north of the site you will find the Calder and Hebble Navigation Canal where you can pick up the towpath. N.B Please note cycling is not permitted on the moor.",
