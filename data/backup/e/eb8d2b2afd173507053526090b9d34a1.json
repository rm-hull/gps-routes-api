  "description": "This Surrey based village has some nice trails through the local commons and woodland. The pretty village includes several old buildings including a grade II* listed medieval church. There's also the quintessential English village green with picturesque duck pond and cricket pitch. This circular walk explores Pirbright Common and Brookwood Heath just to the south east of the settlement. It's a pleasant area for a stroll with a network of footpaths taking you around the sites. On the way you'll pass heathland and woodland with lots of birdlife to look out for on the way. On the eastern side of the route you will find the noteworthy Brookwood Cemetery. The cemetery is the largest in the UK and includes a 220 Acre park with some good walking trails.",
