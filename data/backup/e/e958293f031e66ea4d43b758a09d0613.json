  "description": "This epic long distance walking trail runs from Dublin to Clonegal via the wonderful scenery of the Wicklow Mountains. The waymarked route runs for 131-kilometres (81 miles) and passes through some spectacular mountainous terrain with several beautiful loughs (lakes) to see on the way. The walk starts off in Marlay Park on the southern outskirts of the city of Dublin. You then head south into the Wicklow Mountains passing through Ticknock Forest where you can climb to the Two Rock and Three Rock Mountains and enjoy amazing views to Dublin. You continue through the woodland trails of Ballinastoe Forest. In this area you will pass the J B Malone Memorial, a significant milestone on the walk. Malone was a hill walking enthusiast who originally proposed the Wicklow Way in 1966. You continue south passing Djouce Mountain and the beautiful lakes of Lough Dan and Lough Tay where there are some splendid views over the water to the surrounding mountains. You continue past the picturesque Glendalough Lake to Drumgoff Forest and then into the into the Glenmalure Valley. The next stage runs to Moyne passing Carrickashane Mountain and Slieve Maan before coming to the flatter farmland of County Carlow. You continue to Shillelagh on an easier section, passing Ballycumber hill and Coolafunshoge with some lovely views of the green countryside and Muskeagh Hill. The final section takes you into Clonegal, passing Raheenakit Forest, Stokeen, Moylisha and the Urelands hills. There's also views of the Derry River Valley as you make your way to the finish point at Clonegal.",
