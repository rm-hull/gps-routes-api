  "description": "This is a popular walk from Canterbury to the nearby village of Chartham. The route uses a waymarked footpath along the River Great Stour to take you to the pretty village which is located about 4 miles to the west of the city. There's lovely countryside views, a series of pretty lakes and lots of pretty orchards to see on the way. The walk starts in the city centre next to the famous cathedral. From here you can pick up the Stour Valley Walk and follow it north through the city to the river. Here you'll enter the lovely Westgate Gardens which are the perfect place for a stroll in the city centre. It is situated alongside Westgate Towers, the city\u2019s 600-year-old gatehouse, and has been a public open space since the Middle Ages, making it one of England\u2019s oldest parks. The waymarked trail then heads west through the park, before passing Bingley's Island, Tonford Manor, Tonford Lake and Swan Lake. Shortly after you come into Chartham itself. The village is very picturesque with a weir and a 19th century corn mill by the river. At the end of the walk you can catch the train directly back to Canterbury or return on the same paths on foot if you prefer. Just before you reach Chartham you can take a small detour from the route to visit the Larkeyvalley Nature Reserve. There's some nice woodland footpaths here with lots of interesting flora and fauna to see too. To extend the walk continue west along the Stour Valley Walk to village Chilham with its pretty lakes and old watermill. You could also visit the ancient woodland and fine viewpoint at Perry Woods here.",

This area also includes the lovely Grove Ferry Walk which starts at the eastern end of the reserve. There's a car park, picnic area, boat trips and a fine riverside pub here. At the western end of the reserve you'll also find the Westbere Marshes and the noteworthy town of Fordwich. Fordwich is notable as Britain's smallest town and also has a great pub with a dining terrace overlooking the Stour."
