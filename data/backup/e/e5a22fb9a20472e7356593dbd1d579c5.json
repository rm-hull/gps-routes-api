  "description": "The Nottinghamshire village of Collingham is located in a nice rural location close to the River Trent. This circular walk from the village heads west to the River Trent to visit Cromwell Lock and Weir. The walk starts on the western side of the village where you can pick up the Trent Valley Way and follow the waymarked trail south and the west along Westfield Lane. This will take you to the River near to Cromwell Lock. Cromwell Weir by the side of the lock is one of the largest weirs on the Trent and marks the tidal limit of the river. Near the lock you'll also find a memorial garden with a block of Scottish granite bearing the names of ten members of the 131 Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers. They were killed after a power failure caused the navigation lights on the weir to go out and their boat went over the crest. The route then heads north along the river before following Carlton Ferry Lane back to the village.",

The village is also not far from Newark on Trent where you can try the Newark River Walk. Here you can visit the Town Lock, Newark Castle, Trent Bridge and the Millgate Museum. You can reach the town by following the riverside path south for a few miles. Just to the west is the International Outdoor Adventure Activity Centre at Walesby Forest and the worthy village of Laxton. It's a historic place and significant as being England\u2019s Last Open Field Village. You can visit the 12th century church, the Norman Motte and find out all about the area's history in the local visitor centre. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nottinghamshire Walks page."
