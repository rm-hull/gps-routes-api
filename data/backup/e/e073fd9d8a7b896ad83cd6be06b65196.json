Prior to this there had been a colliery on the land. The brickworks closed in the 1970's and the land was sold to Knowsley council who used it as a landfill site until 1983 when it was decided to reclaim the land and transform it into a country park. The park is accessed by a tunnel beneath the Liverpool to Manchester railway line which can be seen to the left of the photo."
