  "description": "This walk takes you to the Eagle's Nest viewpoint in the Wye Valley AONB. The site has been described as \"one of the most impressive viewpoints in the British Isles\". The viewpoint is located on Wynd Cliff south of Tintern and east of St Arvans village. It can be reached on the 365 steps from the car park at Lower Wyndcliff, just off the A466. Here you will find an information board with details on the walk and the surrounding woodlands. You can then follow the winding footpath north west through the woods to reach the viewpoint. From here you can enjoy wonderful views over the River Wye Valley to the Severn Bridges and Wales. The viewpoint is part of the Wye Valley Walk so you could continue on the trail to extend your walk. Follow the trail north will take you to the historic ruins of Tintern Abbey, one of the major highlights of the area.",
