  "description": "This 20 mile walk runs from Hessle to Beverley through the Yorkshire wolds. The walk starts near Hull in Hessle, at Humber Bridge Country Park and takes you to the Humber Estuary with fine views of the Humber Bridge . The path then follows the estuary to North Ferriby where you turn north and head towards Beverley through the countryside of the Yorkshire Wolds. The walk passes Welton Dale and the pretty village of Skidby , with its English Heritage windmill, before finishing at the splendid Beverley Minster. Highlights on the route include the section through Risby Park near Beverley. The park includes the site of a medieval village and the remains of Risby Hall which was destroyed by fire in the 1780s. It also includes the lovely Folly Cafe which is a great place to stop for refreshments. In Beverley you can extend your walking by enjoying an easy stroll along the Beverley Beck in the town centre. You can also explore Beverley Westwood , a large area of common land with grazing cattle, a network of footpaths and the historic Black Mill.",
