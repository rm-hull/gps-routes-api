  "description": "This attractive Cotswolds based village is a great place to start a walk. From the settlement there's miles of waymarked trails to explore the scenery of the River Evenlode valley. This circular walk uses some of the local long distance footpaths to explore the surrounding villages and countryside. On the way you'll use sections of the Macmillan Way, the North Cotswold Diamond Way and the Monarch's Way to explore the Daylesford Estate, visit the popular market town of Stow on the Wold and enjoy some local historic architecture at the 17th century Chastleton House. Start the walk in the village where you can pick up the Diamond Way and follow it around the lovely Daylesford House Estate to Daylesford. The estate includes a fine Georgian House with parkland, woodland, a lake and old quarries. The route continue west through Upper and Lower Oddington to Martin's Hill and Maugesbury. Here you turn north west to enter Stow on the Wold. The delightful town includes a number of historic buildings including one purported to be the country's oldest pub. In Stow pick up the Monarch's Way and head north east to Broadwell and then onto Evenlode on quiet country lanes. Continue east and you will soon come to Chastleton where you can visit the National Trust's Chastleton House. You can explore the fascinating Jacobean country house and learn all about the history and architecture of the site. There's also a lovely garden area to explore. The final section of the walk follows the Macmillan Way south from Chastleton to return to Adlestrop.",
