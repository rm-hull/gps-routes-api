  "description": "This canalside Northamptonshire based village is a nice place to start a walk. There's easy trails along the Grand Union Canal and more waterside walks along the River Great Ouse to the south. This circular walk from the village takes you along a section of the Grand Union Canal before following a section of the Hanslope Circular Ride through the countryside to the neighbouring village of Castlethorpe. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up a section of the Milton Keynes Boundary Walk and follow it north along the canal towpath to Thrupp Wharf and Yardley Wharf near Yardley Gobion. Just before Grafton Regis you turn east to link up with the Hanslope Circular Ride. This shared cycling and walking trail will takes you south past Lincoln Lodge to Castlethorpe. From here you head south west, crossing the River Tove near Castlethorpe Mill before skirting the edge of Cosgrove Leisure Park and returning to the village. From here you can extend the walk by heading south east to visit the The Iron Trunk Aqueduct. The structure was built in 1811 and carries the Grand Union Canal over the River Great Ouse, on the borders between Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire.",
