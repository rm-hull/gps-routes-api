  "description": "Enjoy an easy riverside walk along the Thames Path on this walk from Reading to Henley-on-Thames via Sonning. The route runs for just over 9 miles so the walk should take about 3-4 hours. At the end of the walk you can catch a train or bus back to Reading. It's a lovely section of the river with pretty locks, little islands and great views of the surrounding countryside. The walk starts on Caversham Bridge in the centre of Reading. From here you head east along the riverside path to Sonning, passing the Caversham Lakes. These include the Redgrave-Pinsent Rowing Lake named after the Olympic rowers Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Matthew Pinsent.  The GB rowing squad and the Oxford University boat race team train on the lake. The route continues to the village of Sonning which is a particularly pretty area. Here you'll pass Sonning Lock and Sonning Bridge. The photogenic arch bridge was completed in 1775, to replace an earlier wooden bridge. The next stage takes you towards Shiplake where there's another lock, a series of little islands in the river and views over to the historic settlement of Wargrave on the opposite side of the water. Here the path leaves the river to head through the village, passing Bolney Court on the way. The final section runs in to Henley, passing Marsh Lock Weir and the pretty Mill Meadows area of natural beauty. Shortly after you arrive at the finish point of the walk at Henley Bridge. The Grade I listed bridge  was built in 1786 and spans the River Thames between Oxfordshire and Berkshire. To extend the walk try our Henley-on-Thames Circular Walk which uses waymarked trails to explore the countryside surrounding the town. At the other end of the route you could try the Reading Circular River Walk or continue along the Thames Path from Henley to visit nearby Marlow on the Marlow to Henley Walk .",
