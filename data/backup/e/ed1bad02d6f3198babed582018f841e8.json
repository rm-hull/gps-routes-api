Most forests get cut down long before the trees get this big, but the recreation remit of the management here probably means the trees get a longer life. (There is a lot of windthrow in the forest. When trees get big, the wind sees to the ones that escape the chainsaw.)"

  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful cycle or walk around this beautiful country park in Linlithgow, West Lothian. There are 913 acres to explore with a multitude of woodland trails suitable for leisure cyclists, mountain bikers and walkers. For cyclists there are several graded trails ranging from Green (easy) to Red (difficult) and Black (Severe). There are also miles of well surfaced paths through the forest for walkers to enjoy.  You can climb Cockleroy Hill for fabulous views of the surrounding countryside and follow the waterside path around Beecraigs loch. The park has an excellent visitor centre with maps and leaflets. Wildlife in the park includes a red deer herd and Highland Cattle. Beecraigs is located less than 2 miles south of Linlithgow. If you would like to continue your outing you could head to the nearby Muiravonside Country Park where you will find 170 acres of woodland and parkland with views of the River Avon. A stroll around Linlithgow Loch or along the Union Canal are other good options.",
