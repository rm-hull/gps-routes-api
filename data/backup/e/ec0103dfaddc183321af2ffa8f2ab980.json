  "description": "A walk around the 350 acres of parkland at Osterley House in Hounslow West London. The country estate is one of the largest open spaces in west London and has miles of nice footpaths to try. In the park you'll find farmland, cattle, lakes and gardens with herbaceous borders, roses and ornamental vegetables beds. The site also includes family cycle trails so it's a great place for outdoor exercise and just a short hop from central London. The Grand Union Canal passes the park on the eastern and northern sides. You can pick up the towpath to extend your exercise. Heading south will take you towards Brentford and Syon Park where there are more good walking trails.",
