  "description": "This 40 mile circular walk explores the area around Poole Harbour, the second largest natural harbour in the world. It's a varied walk with coastal paths, riverside trails, nature reserves, country parks and heathland to enjoy. The walk starts on Poole Quay where there's a marina with fine views over to Brownsea Island. The route then heads north following a shared cycling and walking trail around Holes Bay to Upton Country Park. There's some lovely parkland and gardens to see in this historic estate. The next stage takes you through Hamworthy, passing Rockley Sands Holiday Park and the Ham Common Nature Reserve where there are some good bird watching opportunities. You continue through Lytchett Minster and Turlin Moor before a woodland section through Gore Heath. The route then heads through the attractive town of Wareham where you can enjoy walks along the River Frome and the Purbeck Way long distance trail. The next stage take you through the wildlife rich Stoborough Heath National Nature Reserve where you can take a detour to visit Arne Nature Reserve. The reserve is another good spot for wildlife with a herd of deer to see. The route then explores the expansive Hartland Moor and Rempstone Heath where there's a network of footpaths and cycleways to try. The trail eventually comes out near the Little Sea on Studland Heath Nature Reserve. Follow the trails north across the reserve and it will take you to the chain ferry where you can cross over to the Sandbanks side. You'll then follow roads around the harbour to Parkstone Bay and Baiter Park before arriving back at the quay.",
