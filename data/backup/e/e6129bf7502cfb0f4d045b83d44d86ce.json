  "description": "These delightful little woods are located in the Somerset village of Wayford. There's nice easy trails to follow around the site, where you will find pretty streams with little bridges, an ornamental lake, Rhododendrons, azaleas and bluebells in the spring months. There's also orchids in the summer months which attract a wide variety of butterflies. The woods have a number of seats to rest your legs and a picnic area where you can enjoy a packed lunch. After exploring the woods you can visit the interesting little village of Wayford which includes the noteworthy Wayford Manor House. The Grade I listed building dates from 1600 and includes a Japanese garden and a collection of mature trees, along with a rock garden, orchard and shrubs. There's also the Church of St Michael which dates from the 13th century and has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. The Liberty Trail runs past the southern edge of the woods. You can pick up this long distance trail to extend your walking in the area. Following it west will take you to Winsham and Forde Abbey with views of the River Axe on the way. It's only about a 2 mile walk to the abbey where you will find a historic Cistercian monastery with 30 acres of award winning gardens to explore. Heading east along the Liberty Trail will take you to Misterton and Crewkerne. Also nearby is Cricket St Thomas where there's peaceful lakes, secluded woodland and beautiful gardens.",
