  "description": "This pretty little Buckinghamshire village is located in the Chilterns near Henley on Thames. It's a picture postcard place with a number of medieval and Georgian cottages scattered around a very fine old church. The village's name comes from the Anglo Saxon 'Tinghurst', meaning 'wooded hill where assemblies are made'. This circular walk uses sections of the Chiltern Way to take you on a tour of the area surrounding the village. There's visits to a number of nearby villages and some small hill climbs with fine views over the Hambleden Valley. The walk may seem familiar as the scenic nature of the area has lead to it being used as a film location on several occasions. The walk starts in Fingest and first heads west to Turville Hill and the neighbouring village of Turville . It's another pretty little place with a 12th century church and the noteworthy Cobstone Windmill. Often referred to as the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Windmill as it was used in a scene in the 1967 film, having been cosmetically restored for filming. The route then heads south west to Dolesden and Southend before turning south east to Gussetts Wood and Upper Woodead Farm. Near here a woodland section begins taking you to Hambleden. There are a number of picturesque brick and\u00a0flint\u00a0cottages and a 14th century church here. The Elizabethan manor house opposite the church dates from 1603\u00a0and was the former home of\u00a0Lord Cardigan\u00a0who led the ill-fated\u00a0Charge of the Light Brigade. At Hambleden the route turns north to Pheasant's Hill and Skirmett before passing through Adam's Wood and Fingest Wood and returning to the village.",
