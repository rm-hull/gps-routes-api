  "description": "The Surrey town of Camberley is nicely positioned on the edge of expansive woodland and heathland in the Blackwater Valley. This walk from the town visits Swinley Forest and Bracknell Forest before heading to the pretty Tri Lakes Country Park and Horseshoe Lake . On the way there's miles of good woodland trails and some nice waterside paths along the lakes in the park. The walk starts on the northern edge of the town and heads north to the woodland and heathland on Olddean Common. Footpaths then take you through Paschal Wood to Deer Rock Hill on the edge of Bagshot Heath. Continue north west and you will link up with the Three Castles Path . You can follow the waymarked trail south west past Butter Hill and Little Sandhurst to Tri Lakes Country Park. There's a series of nice footpaths here running around several lakes.",
