  "description": "This epic long distance trail explores the\u00a0Slieve Bloom Mountains\u00a0of Ireland. The waymarked circular trail runs for 70-kilometres through some wonderful mountainous scenery with challenging climbs, wonderful views, expansive woodland, riverside trails and rushing waterfalls. The walk starts at the Glenbarrow trail head where there is a car park. The first section is very pleasant, taking you south west along the River Barrow to the Glenbarrow Clamp Hole Waterfall . You continue south west past Clarnahinch\u00a0Mountain and Castleconor before passing through the Kinnitty Forest. In this area you can pick up the Kinnitty Castle Loop Walk and visit the 19th-century gothic revival castle and hotel. There's also some fine views of the Camcor River valley, a picnic area here and a car park which offers an alternative start point to the walk. The route then heads to Cadamstown where you turn east, passing Barradoos Mountain before picking up a section along the River Clodiagh towards Clonaslee. The path then heads south with more river views before an extensive area of forestry takes you east back to Glenbarrow.",
