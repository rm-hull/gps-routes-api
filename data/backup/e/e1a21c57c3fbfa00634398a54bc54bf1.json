  "description": "The village of Groombridge is located on the border between Kent and East Sussex. It's in in a great spot for walking with the countryside of the High Weald AONB and the grounds of Groombridge Place to explore. This circular walk from the village starts near the train station and follows the waymarked Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk to Groombridge place. Here you'll find beautiful gardens surrounding a moated manor house. There are a series of award winning gardens with delightful features such as a moat, streams and herbaceous borders. Highlights include the Secret Garden with blue agapanthus, foxgloves and gazania. The Oriental Garden has Japanese maples and an unusual grass fountain at its centre. The Knot Garden has a lovely pathway bordered by Yew Trees and a giant chessboard opposite. Wildlife is an important aspect of Groombridge Place. There are resident peacocks, goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys, piglets, alpacas, reindeer and Shetland ponies. There is also a zedonk - an unusual creature that is half donkey, half zebra. In the woodland section you should look out for deer. The Raptor Centre puts on magnificent flying displays featuring feature eagles, hawks, owls and falcons and takes place at 12.30pm and 3.30 pm. The 17th century manor was used Longbourn (home of the Bennets) for the 2005 film Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who lived in nearby Crowboroug, was a regular visitor to Groombridge Place. He used the house and gardens in some of his Sherlock Holmes stories and also took part in s\u00e9ances at the manor. After exploring the gardens you can follow alternative footpaths past the River Grom and back to the village centre. The Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk runs past the house so you could pick this trail up to continue your walk into the surrounding countryside.",
