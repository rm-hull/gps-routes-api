      "content": "From the park it's easy to follow the Cown Edge Way east to visit the Etherow Valley and the villages of Chisworth and Charlesworth. If you head south you'll soon come to Etherow Country Park. There's woodland paths, riverside trails and a pretty lake to enjoy here. Near the park you could visit the historic Chadkirk Country Estate. There's a noteworthy 16th century chapel, a little cafe and a walled garden to enjoy here. Just over a mile to the wst of the park you can pick up the Peak Forest Canal in Hyde. The canal forms part of the longer Cheshire Ring Canal Walk which explores the canals of the county. You could follow the towpath south into Bredbury or north towards Manchester. The waymarked Tame Valley Way can also be picked up near the canal at Haughton Green. You can follow the trail along the River Tame to the nearby Reddish Vale Country Park. Near here there's also the bluebell woodland and wildlife in Haughton Dale Nature Reserve at Haughton Green. The long distance Tameside Trail passes through the park. The 30 mile circular walk explores several of the highlights of the River Tame Valley. The route starts just to the east of the park at Broadbottom railway station. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
