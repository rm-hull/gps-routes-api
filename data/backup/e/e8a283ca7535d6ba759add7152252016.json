In 2007, EWS was purchased by DB Schenker Rail (UK), a wholy owned subsidiary of German State Railways. It is intended that the EWS livery will be replaced by that of DB Schenker Rail in due course.\nThis view was taken from the Ribblehead Station Inn. The lower slopes of Whernside are visible beyond."

The line is notable as the last main railway in Britain to be constructed primarily with manual labour. It opened to passengers in 1876."

  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this famous landmark in the Yorkshire Dales. The impressive viaduct\u00a0carries the\u00a0Settle-Carlisle Railway\u00a0across Batty Moss in the valley of the\u00a0River Ribble\u00a0at\u00a0Ribblehead, in\u00a0North Yorkshire. The Grade II* listed\u00a0structure is one of England's greatest monuments to Victorian engineering. It is a hugely pictureque spot with the structure surrounded by imposing Yorkshire Hills. You can start the walk from the car park just to the south of the viaduct, off the B6255. You can also visit the viaduct by public transport by catching the train to Ribblehead railway station. It's an interesting little station with a small shop selling memorabilia and a Visitor Centre which includes exhibits about the history of the line and the fight to keep it open. From the car park footpaths head north on the eastern side of the railway line, taking you to Winterscales Farm. Here you turn south west towards Broadrake, before crossing Winterscale Beck and heading back towards the viaduct. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the excellent Station Inn. The classic stone pub overlooks the viaduct and has free parking. You can follow the path to the viaduct by using the google street view link below. It shows the surfaced path with views of the viaduct and hills behind. To extend your walking in the area you could continue west and visit Twistleton Scar where there is some splendid limestone scenery. The challenging climb to Whernside can also be started from the same car park. One of the Yorkshire Three Peaks, the mountain stands at a height of  736\u00a0m (2,415\u00a0ft) with tremendous views towards the Lake District and the coast. Our Whernside, Ingleborough Circular Walk starts and finishes from the viaduct and will take you up to Park Fell and Simon Fell before visiting two of the famous peaks. The long distance Dales Way and Ribble Way both pass near to the viaduct so you could pick up these splendid trails to further explore this area of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.",
