    "description": "This walk follows the opening section of the Northumberland Coast Path from the village of Cresswell to the beautiful Druridge Bay Country Park . It's about a 4.5 mile walk along a fairly flat section of the trail running along the beach and sand dunes. On the way you will pass the Cresswell Pond and Druridge Bay Pools Nature Reserves where you can look out for a large variety of wildlife. At the end of the walk there's a nice circular waterside trail to follow around the lake in the country park. You can extend the outing on the next section of the path from Druridge Bay to Amble . There's some fine sand dunes and lovely views to the wildlife rich Coquet Island from here.",
