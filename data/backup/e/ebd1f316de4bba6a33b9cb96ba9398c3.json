  "description": "Enjoy a short climb to Hen Cloud on this circular walk in the Staffordshire Peak District. The hill is on the southern end of a gritstone escarpment which includes The Roaches and Ramshaw Rocks. You can start your walk from the roadside parking area on the Roach Road, just to the west of Hen Cloud. On the eastern side of the road you can pick up a footpath climbing to the summit. There's footpaths you can follow around the hill top with wonderful rock formations and fabulous views to enjoy as you go. The area is great for bird watching too with red grouse, buzzard and peregrines to look out for. If you'd like to extend the walk you can head north and walk the full length of The Roaches. It's a spectacular ridge walk with more wonderful views, a series of gritstone boulders and a visit to the mystical Doxy Pool. Just to the south west is Tittesworth Reservoir which has a nice circular trail to follow around it.",

      "content": "There's a few good options for some post walk refreshments near the hill, in the Upper Hulme area. The Winking Man is a family friendly country pub with a nice outdoor seating area to relax in on warmer days. There's a good menu and a nice large car park with electric hook up points. You can find the pub just to the east of the hill on Buxton Rd, Upper Hulme with a postcode of ST13 8UH. The delightful Roaches Tea Rooms are just to the north. They are wonderfully located nesting on the hillside of the Roaches, some 300 metres above sea level with breathtaking views stretching over the valley. There's a splendid outside patio seating which includes a pretty herb garden. They also have a couple of nice holiday cottages if you are looking for accommodation. You can find the tea rooms at Paddock Farm, Roach Road, with a postcode of ST13 8TY for your sat navs. Just to the south there's the village of Blackshaw Moor and The Three Horseshoes. The high quality inn includes beautiful gardens, a patio, and stunning views over the Roaches and surrounding countryside. The pub was named by CAMRA in 2019 as having one of the top ten beer gardens in the UK. The interior is charming too with oak beams and open fires for colder days. You can find them on the Buxton Road at postcode ST13 8TW for your sat navs."

      "content": "The longer Gradbach Walk starts from the car park in the little hamlet, located a couple of miles north of the site. It visits the eery chasm at Lud's Church before heading to The Roaches, Hen Cloud and Three Shires Head. It's a nice way of seeing several of the highlights of the area on one trail loop. On the way you'll also pass the picturesque Gradbach Mill on the River Dane. The 18th century mill was used to manufacture sewing silk and is an interesting reminder of the historic past of Gradbach. Today it's a Youth Hostel providing accommodation if you wish to stay over in this lovely area. The little village of Wincle is also nearby. There's a fine old pub and the excellent Wincle Brewery to visit here. For more walking ideas in the area see the White Peak Walks page."
