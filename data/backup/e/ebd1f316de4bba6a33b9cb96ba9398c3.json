  "description": "Enjoy a short climb to Hen Cloud on this circular walk in the Staffordshire Peak District. The hill is on the southern end of a gritstone escarpment which includes The Roaches and Ramshaw Rocks. You can start your walk from the roadside parking area on the Roach Road, just to the west of Hen Cloud. On the eastern side of the road you can pick up a footpath climbing to the summit. There's footpaths you can follow around the hill top with wonderful rock formations and fabulous views to enjoy as you go. The area is great for bird watching too with red grouse, buzzard and peregrines to look out for. If you'd like to extend the walk you can head north and walk the full length of The Roaches. It's a spectacular ridge walk with more wonderful views, a series of gritstone boulders and a visit to the mystical Doxy Pool. Just to the south west is Tittesworth Reservoir which has a nice circular trail to follow around it.",
