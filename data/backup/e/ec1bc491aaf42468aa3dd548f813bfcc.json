  "description": "Enjoy lovely waterside walking and cycling in this country park in Fife.  The centrepiece of park is the beautiful Loch Ore which is surrounded by woodlands, meadows, grasslands, ponds and a Nature Reserve. You can explore the park on four way-marked trails of varying lengths and difficulty. The routes take you to Lochore Castle, Harran Hill Wood (with ancient woodland), Harran Hill (where there are fine views of the park) and over the Clune where there are archaeological features dating back to the Bronze Age. The park is located just north of Cowdenbeath and Dunfermline and just a couple of miles south of Loch Leven. To continue your walking in the area head north to Loch Leven and enjoy the circular heritage trail around the water.",
