  "description": "This circular walk visits Clifden Castle and the scenic Sky Road in the Connemara region of County Galway. There's a small parking area just off the Sky Road, to the north east of the castle. From here you can pick up a narrow lane to take you through the nearby Castle Gate and then onto the castle itself. Here you can enjoy views of the early 19th century ruined manor house, the surrounding farmland and Clifden Bay. The route then loops round to the Sky Road where you can enjoy some more fabulous views over the area from the elevated spot. You can extend the walk by heading west along the Sky Road to the coast at Eyrephort Beach. See the Sky Road Walk page for full details.",

      "content": "A half hour drive to the north east there's the 19th century Kylemore Abbey to visit. The popular estate includes loughside trails, a Victorian walled garden, woodland paths and views of the surrounding Twelve Bens Mountains. Near here there's also the stunning Killary Fjord. There's some wonderful scenery here with the fjord flanked by the mountains of Mweelrea and Ben Gorm. About an hours drive north there's the climb to the holy mountain of Croagh Patrick. There's a Pilgrimage Trail to the summit where you can enjoy glorious views over Westport Bay, Clew Bay and the Mayo mountains. To the east there's the wonderful Ashford Castle. The medieval/Victorian castle includes beautiful grounds, riverside trails and a popular hawk walk. It is located on the Galway side of Lough Corrib, the largest lake in the Republic of Ireland. In this area you can also try the Oughterard Wind Farm Walk. The scenic circular walk explores the expansive Galway Wind Park, Ireland's largest on shore windfarm. To the north of Lough Corrib there's the climb to Mount Gable where you can enjoy some wonderful views back down to the lough and to the coast. To the north east is Castlebar where there's a lovely waterside circular trail around Lough Lannagh. The long distance Great Western Greenway can also be picked up here. Just to the south there's Derrigimlagh Bog where you can visit two interesting historic sites. The remote and secluded location served as the crash site for John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in 1919, during their historic non-stop flight across the Atlantic. There is a memorial here to commemorate the event. The site is also the location of the Marconi wireless transmitting station. Nearby you can also explore the beautiful grounds of the 18th century Ballynahinch Castle. Here you can enjoy beautiful gardens, a picturesque lake, ancient woodland and glorious views of the surrounding Twelve Bens mountain range. To the north west there's Cleggan where you can catch the ferry to Inishbofin island. There's a waymarked circular loop walk here passing rugged cliffs, a photogenic ruined fort, pretty lakes and stone beaches. Near here there's also Clare Island which you can reach from Roonagh Pier near the small town of Louisburgh. The island has strong associations with the notorious \"Grace\" O'Malley, the 'pirate queen' of the 16th century."
