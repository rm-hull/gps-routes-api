  "description": "This circular walk visits Clifden Castle and the scenic Sky Road in the\u00a0Connemara\u00a0region of\u00a0County Galway. There's a small parking area just off the Sky Road, to the north east of the castle. From here you can pick up a narrow lane to take you through the nearby Castle Gate and then onto the castle itself. Here you can enjoy views of the early 19th century ruined manor house, the surrounding farmland and Clifden Bay. The route then loops round to the Sky Road where you can enjoy some more fabulous views over the area from the elevated spot. You can extend the walk by heading west along the Sky Road to the coast at Eyrephort Beach. See the Sky Road Walk page for full details.",
