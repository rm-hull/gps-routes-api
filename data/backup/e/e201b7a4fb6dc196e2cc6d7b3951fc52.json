  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this lovely reservoir near Sheffield. A good foopath runs around the perimeter of the reservoir which is ideal for an afternoon stroll.  There are long waterside sections and some woodland trails to enjoy. The water is also surrounded by some lovely Peak District countryside. The flat path runs for a distance of just over 3 miles making it suitable for most abilities. The walk begins at the village of Lower Bradfield at the western end of the reservoir. You then follow the path to Low Holdworth before returning via Oak Farm, with views of the Ughill Brook. The walk can easily by extended by visiting the nearby Agden and Dale Dike Reservoirs where you will find more waterside footpaths. The route below is a walking trail but cyclists can also enjoy the reservoir by using the country lanes around the water. To extend your walking in the area you could visit the adjacent Agden Reservoir where there is another nice circular trail to try.  Also nearby are Dale Dike Reservoir and Strines Reservoir .",
