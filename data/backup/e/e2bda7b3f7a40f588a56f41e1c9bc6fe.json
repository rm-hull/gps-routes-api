These porticoed Classical towers are all that survive from the church of St Mary the Virgin, originally built in 1735 and re-modelled in an unconventional style by Robert Adam in 1776. The nave between the two towers was demolished in 1870 when a new church was built nearby. The Towers come under the overall supervision of English Heritage, but are managed by the local Residents' Association, from whom a key is available."
