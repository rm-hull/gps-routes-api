  "description": "This walk visits High Rocks in Royal Tunbridge Wells. The photogenic sandstone rocks are located just west of the town and a major local highlight. The area includes some pleasant footpaths taking you past the rocks and through some attractive woodland. Once a Stone Age camp, the rocks have a fascinating history, dating back millions of years and are now classified as a National Monument. Part of the Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk runs through the area so you can pick up this path to extend your walk. If you follow the trail east it will take you to Tunbridge Wells Common where there are miles of footpaths and more interesting local geology at Wellington Rock. The walk on the map below will link you to both rocks.",
