  "description": "This lovely cycle and walk route starts on the banks of the River Ouse in the city of York and follows the Trans Pennine Trail and the York to Selby Railway Path south to Selby. The mostly flat, off road route is ideal for a relaxing afternoon's cycling or walking and has views of York racecourse and the River Ouse. It runs for a distance of about about 16 miles passing Bishopthorpe, Naburn Bridge on the River Ouse, Riccall and Barlby on the way. In Selby you can continue your exercise at the Selby Canal. Some of the canal path is available to cyclists or you can walk the whole length if you prefer.",
