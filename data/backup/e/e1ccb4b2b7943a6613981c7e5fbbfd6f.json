  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Starcross to Powderham Castle and the village of Kenton. There's fine views over the Exe Estuary and a lovely deer park to explore on this varied route. The walk starts on the Exe Estuary at Starcross train station. Here you can pick up the Exe Valley Way and follow it north along the river to Powderham Sands. You then turn west and then south to visit the castle and expansive deer park. The manor house dates back to the 14th century and is a Grade I\u00a0listed building. There are beautiful grounds and gardens to explore here. The route then follows a footpath south west into Kenton, crossing the River Kenn as you go. From Kenton you can follow some quiet country lanes south east to Witcombe and Starcross.",
