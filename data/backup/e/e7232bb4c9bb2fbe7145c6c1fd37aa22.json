  "description": "Climb to the 245m (800ft) summit of Kymin Hill and enjoy wonderful views down the Wye Valley, up into the Brecon Beacons and across to the Malvern Hills. The National Trust owned site also has nice woodland trails and the Grade II listed Round House built in the late 18th century. There is also a Naval Temple built in 1800 to commemorate the second anniversary of the British naval victory at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. In the early 19th century Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson visited the Naval Temple and the Roundhouse on Kymin Hill, where he enjoyed the magnificent views. On a clear day you can see Abergavenny with Blorenge, Sugarloaf Mountain, Skirrid, Pen-y-fan and Corn Du. The Kymin Dash takes place on the hill every year. The course covers about 7 miles, circling the town and both ascending and descending the Kymin by forest tracks, field paths and minor roads. It's easy to extend your walk in this lovely area. You can pick up the Wye Valley Walk and head along the river to the mysterious King Arthur's Cave and Symonds Yat Rock where you can enjoy more great views and a number of waymarked walking trails. You can virtually explore the Kymin by using the google street view link below!",

Here you will find the historic St Briavels Castle which dates back to the 12th century and is open to the public under the care of English Heritage. The village can be accessed by crossing the Bigsweir Bridge over the Wye from Llandogo in Wales to St Briavels in England on the other side. In Llandogo you can enjoy a walk to the pretty Cleddon Falls on the River Cleddon. Near here there's Brockweir where there is easy access to the historic ruins of Tintern Abbey and Tintern Old Station, where you can learn all about the history of the local railway. For more walking ideas in the area see the Wye Valley Walks page."
