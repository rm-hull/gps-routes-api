  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful circular walk around the pretty Cole Mere in Shropshire.  The mere is surrounded by mature woodland with two very attractive hay meadows where you can see wildflowers and orchids during the warmer months. The park attracts a variety of wildfowl including snipe, curlew and pochard. The Llangollen Canal also runs through Colmere and there are several other nearby meres including Blake Mere, White Mere and Newton Mere. As such, there is plenty of scope for continuing your walk if you have time. You can start your walk from the Colemere Car Park at the south eastern end of the lake. It's located at postcode SY12 0QW for your sat navs. The park is located a couple of miles east of Ellesmere. If you'd like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Ellesmere Lake where there are lakeside and woodland footpaths to enjoy.",
