  "description": "This circular walk on Derwentwater climbs to Walla Crag and explores Great Wood in the Lake District. It's a short but rewarding climb with wonderful views over the lake below. The walk can be started from nearby Keswick but this route starts and finishes from the Great Wood car park off Borrowdale Road, near Calfclose Bay. From here you can directly pick up the Walla Crag Trail to take you up to the crag. The trail heads south from the car park to Cat Gill before turning north east passing Lady's Rake and then on to the Walla Crag summit. The high point stands at 379 m (1,243 ft) with wonderful views over Derwentwater and towards Skiddaw. You can just descend the same way but this route continues on to Castlerigg where you cross the pretty Brockle Beck. Here you have the option of visiting the fascinating Castlerigg Stone Circle which is just off the route at Castlerigg. However, this route descends on woodland trails through Great Wood, passing Watson's Park on the way. There's lots to enjoy on the walk with heather in the summer months, the rushing waters of Cat Gill and some spectacular Lakeland views. The walk can be extended by heading along the lake towards Ashness Bridge and Suprise View. Bleaberry fell is also nearby. Just to the north is the wonderful Friar's Crag viewpoint and the Castlehead viewpoint. These both proffer wonderful views of the lake and surrounding fells. The walk can also be started from Keswick as shown in the video below.",
