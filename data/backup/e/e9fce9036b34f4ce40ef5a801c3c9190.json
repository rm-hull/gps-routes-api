  "description": "Follow the Two Castles trail from Devon into Cornwall and enjoy beautiful countryside, woodland and downland. The route starts at Okehampton castle and heads east through Sourton, Stowford, Lewtrenchard and Lifton to Launceston, finishing near Launceston castle. The historic castle has a history dating back to the 11th century. Today the castle is owned by the duchy of Cornwall and operated by English Heritage as a tourist attraction. Much of the castle defences remain, including the motte, keep and high tower which overlook the castle's former deer park to the south. Walk highlights include a lovely stretch along the West Okement river and through Okehampton Golf Course at the start, followed by a walk through Meldon Wood and past Meldon Reservoir. Other highlights include a stretch through Borley Wood near Lewtrenchard and the Dingles Steam Village near Stowford.",
