  "description": "This large woodland area near Llanidloes has miles of walking paths and mountain bike trails to try. In the forest you will find the source of the River Severn, pretty waterfalls and a wide variety of wildlife. Look out for ospreys, buzzards, goshawks and red kites on your way through the woods. You can start your exercise from the Hafren Forest car park. Here you'll find an information point, toilets and a picnic area. It's located near the centre of the forest and gives direct access to the trails. The long distance Severn Way passes through the forest so you can pick this up to extend your walk. If you head north west along the path through the woods you will come to the start of the trail at the Source of the River Severn on the slopes of Plynlimon. If you follow the trail south east it will take you into Llanidloes. You could also head east and visit the nearby Llyn Clywedog. The large lake has nice cycling and walking trails including the long distance Glyndwr's Way which runs along the western side of the water. The lake can be found on the eastern fringe of the forest.",
