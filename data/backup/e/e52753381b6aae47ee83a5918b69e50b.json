Just to the east of the site there is a Early Saxon cemetery, and on raised ground to the north both an Iron Age burial site and Saxon cemetery have been excavated. The Arminghall Henge is located to the north-east."

For the first time in 75 years archaeological excavations will be carried out within the walls of the Roman settlement of Venta Icenorum (Caistor St Edmund), one of only three Roman towns in the country that have not been built over by modern settlements. Venta Icenorum is thought to have been established in the aftermath of Boudicca's failed rebellion of AD60-61. The site has been subject to digs before but these took place outside its walls."

Caistor is a protected site and any research has to be planned in depth before permission to excavate is being granted. Visitors are welcome and archaeologists have marked out the streets of the Roman town to give people the chance to get a feel of the original layout. The progress of the archaeological dig will be featured on television in a Time Team documentary."

Whilst flying at around 2,000 feet (600 m) he noticed cropmarks of a circular enclosure made of two concentric rings with a horseshoe of eight pit-like markings within it."

Crawford, who pronounced it to be the Norwich Woodhenge but it was not until 1935 that it was first excavated, by Grahame Clark. His work established that two circular rings were ditches, the outer one 1.5 m deep and the inner one 2.3 m deep, with indications of a bank that once stood between them. The pits in the middle were postholes for timbers that would have been almost 1 m in diameter. The site dates to the Neolithic, with a radiocarbon date of 3650-2650 Cal BC (4440\u00b1150) from charcoal from a post-pit. The henge is orientated on the mid-winter sunset, which, when viewed from the lication, sets down the slope of nearby high ground, Chapel Hill."

  "description": "This historical circular walk explores the Roman town of Caistor St Edmund in Norfolk. It then follows a waymarked trail up to Arminghall Henge located just to the north. The walk starts from the parking area at the Roman Town. From here you can pick up footpaths heading west around the interesting site which includes earthworks, ruined walls and ditches. These fascinating ruins are in the care of the Norfolk Archaeological Trust and managed by South Norfolk Council. It's also a very scenic area with lots of wildflowers growing in the summer and views of the River Tas which runs along the western side of the town. The site is well laid out with two waymarked walking trails to follow through the area. There's also a number of information boards dotted around giving further details of the history of the site. After exploring the town you can pick up the Boudicca Way and follow the waymarked trail to nearby Arminghall village. From here you head north west past Arminghall Wood to Arminghall Henge. The site dates to the\u00a0Neolithic period and\u00a0is one of the most important prehistoric discoveries in Norfolk. After exploring the henge you retrace your steps to Arminghall before following other public footpaths and country lanes back to Caistor St Edmund.",
