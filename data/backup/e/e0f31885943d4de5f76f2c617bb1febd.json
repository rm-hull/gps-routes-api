His most famous building is the Natural History Museum. He was also responsible for notable local buildings such as Reading Town Hall and Reading School. Behind the shelter is the Royal Oak pub, a building dating from the 18th century."

The pretty little Berkshire village is located about 7 miles north of Newbury. From the village you can pick up public footpaths heading north through some peaceful woodland to the neighbouring village of Ashampstead. The paths are fairly flat so it's a fairly easy walk. On the way you can look out for various woodland birds and the old Yattendon Court.",
