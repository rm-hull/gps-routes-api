  "description": "Enjoy a short walk around this pretty reservoir on the western edge of the North York Moors near Osmotherley. It's a very popular beauty spot with the lovely waters surrounded by attractive woodland and moorland scenery. You can follow the circular walking trail around the reservoir. It runs for roughly 1.5 miles so it's about a 40 minute stroll. For cyclists there is a country lane to follow along the western side. There's also a traffic free National Cycle Network path running along the southern side of the reservoir next to the dam. It runs along Route 65 through the woodland on the eastern side of the reservoir. You can start your walk from the car park at the northern end of the water. Then head south to pick up the waterside trail. There's a picnic area at the southern end of the water in the woodland area. To continue your walking in the area you could try our circular walk around Osmotherley which visits the reservoir, Arncliffe Wood and the medieval Mount Grace Priory. The Lyke Wake Walk starts from the car park so this is a good option if you'd like to continue your walking in the North York Moors. The Cleveland Way also passes nearby. You could follow the trails to nearby Arncliffe Wood or head south to the reservoirs on Thimbleby Moor.",
