  "description": "Enjoy a short walk around this pretty reservoir on the western edge of the North York Moors near Osmotherley. It's a very popular beauty spot with the lovely waters surrounded by attractive woodland and moorland scenery. You can follow the circular walking trail around the reservoir. It runs for roughly 1.5 miles so it's about a 40 minute stroll. For cyclists there is a country lane to follow along the western side. There's also a traffic free National Cycle Network path running along the southern side of the reservoir next to the dam. It runs along Route 65 through the woodland on the eastern side of the reservoir. You can start your walk from the car park at the northern end of the water. Then head south to pick up the waterside trail. There's a picnic area at the southern end of the water in the woodland area. To continue your walking in the area you could try our circular walk around Osmotherley which visits the reservoir, Arncliffe Wood and the medieval Mount Grace Priory. The Lyke Wake Walk starts from the car park so this is a good option if you'd like to continue your walking in the North York Moors. The Cleveland Way also passes nearby. You could follow the trails to nearby Arncliffe Wood or head south to the reservoirs on Thimbleby Moor.",

      "content": "Just to the west of the reservoir are the fascinating ruins of Mount Grace Priory. The Carthusian house dates from the 14th century when it was founded by Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey the son of King Richard II's half-brother Thomas, Earl of Kent. The site is now run by English Heritage and the National Trust so visitors today can explore the ruins of the whole monastery, together with the typically small Carthusian chapel and the later house. The ruins are only about a mile west of the reservoir so make a fine addition to your outing.  Pictured above the nearby Mount Grace Priory which makes a fine extension to your outing. Meals and snacks can be purchased here at the on site cafe. The Swainby Walk starts from the nearby little village and provides an alternate circular walk in the area. It visits Mount Grace and Osmotherley before heading to reservoir. In Swainby the pretty Scugdale Beck meanders through the little village which also includes the ruins of a 12th century medieval castle. For more walking ideas in the area see the North York Moors Walks page."
