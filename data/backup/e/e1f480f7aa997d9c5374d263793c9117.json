The guided tour was informative, bringing to life the stories of the MacLeod clan and their history. The gardens are beautifully maintained, and we enjoyed a peaceful walk with some incredible views over the loch. Don\u2019t miss the boat trip to see the seals \u2013 it was a real highlight!\"  \"A unique and scenic experience\" Visited July 2023 4.5 stars By Tom K. \"The castle and grounds are stunning! The gardens are a real treat, and the castle itself has an impressive collection of artefacts. We also tried the caf\u00e9, which served a nice selection of local dishes. It\u2019s a bit of a drive from other parts of Skye, but well worth it for a day out filled with history and nature. Loved every moment!\"  \"A highlight of our Skye trip!\" Visited June 2023 5 stars By Charlotte R. \"Dunvegan Castle is a must-see on Skye.

Highly recommend for anyone visiting the island.\"  \"Fantastic gardens and historic atmosphere\" Visited September 2022 4 stars By Liam H. \"The castle itself is a fascinating glimpse into clan history, but the gardens are what impressed me the most! They\u2019re beautifully designed, with lots of quiet spots to relax and enjoy the scenery. The views over the water are breathtaking, and the boat trip to see the seals was delightful.
