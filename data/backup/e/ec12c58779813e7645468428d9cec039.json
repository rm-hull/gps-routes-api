  "description": "This walk in West Lothian takes you along a section of the Union Canal from Linlithgow to the Muiravonside Country Park. It's just over a 3 mile walk along the flat towpath to the park which lies just to the west of the town. The 170 acre park is one of the area highlights and includes views of the River Avon gorge and the historic Avon Aqueduct. You can start the walk from just south of the train station. Along the way you will pass a series of old bridges and enjoy some fine views of the surrounding countryside. You may also see some cyclists as the towpath is open to bikes too. The area is also home to the Linlithgow Canal Centre which includes an interesting museum where you can learn all about the history of the canal. There's also a nice tea room for refreshments, relaxing boat trips and boat hire. To continue your walking in the area head to Linlithgow Loch where there are more lovely waterside paths to try.",
