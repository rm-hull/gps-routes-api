  "description": "This delightful island of the Cornish coast is well worth a visit. You can catch a boat from East Looe during the summer months and then enjoy a 1km walk around the beautiful little island. It's a fantastic place for wildlife lovers with grey seals, cormorants, shags and oystercatchers to look out for. There's also wildflower meadows which attract different types of butterfly. Keep your eyes peeled for speckled wood, meadow brown and red admiral as you make your way across the meadows. The island also includes mix of grassland, scrub, woods and fabulous views back along the Cornish coast. The South West Coast Path runs through Looe so you could try the Looe to Polperro coastal walk to extend your walking in the area.",
