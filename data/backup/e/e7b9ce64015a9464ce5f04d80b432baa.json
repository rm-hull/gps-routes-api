  "description": "This delightful island of the Cornish coast is well worth a visit. You can catch a boat from East Looe during the summer months and then enjoy a 1km walk around the beautiful little island. It's a fantastic place for wildlife lovers with grey seals, cormorants, shags and oystercatchers to look out for. There's also wildflower meadows which attract different types of butterfly. Keep your eyes peeled for speckled wood, meadow brown and red admiral as you make your way across the meadows. The island also includes mix of grassland, scrub, woods and fabulous views back along the Cornish coast. The South West Coast Path runs through Looe so you could try the Looe to Polperro coastal walk to extend your walking in the area.",

      "content": "The Jolly Sailor in Looe is a historic pub of some note. It was originally established in 1516 making it one of the oldest pubs in England. Affectionately known as 'the Jolly' by the locals, it has been a place of rest and recreation for seafarers and travellers alike for centuries. Inside the main beam in the pub was taken from a French ship of the line at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The ship was captured and renamed The Indefatigable. When she was later broken up, the landlord of the time arranged for the beam to be installed in the main bar and it remains there to this day. The pub has been refurbished to a very high standard, making it one of the most pleasant, as well as the most characterful of places to drink or stay in the town. You can find the pub on Princes Square, Looe at postcode PL13 2EP."
