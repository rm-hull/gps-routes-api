  "description": "A nice circular walk through the countryside surrounding the Oxfordshire village of Deddington. The route makes use of bridleways and footpaths to visit the village of Clifton and explore part of the Cherwell Valley. There's lovely rolling north Oxfordshire countryside and great views from the high points north of the village. Highlights on the route include old Paper Mill Cottages from the 18th century, the thatched 17th century pub in Clifton and views of the River Swere. If you would like to extend your walk then you could pick up the Oxford Canal Walk near Clifton. Following the towpath north will take you to Kings Sutton. Also nearby is Stoke Wood which includes an impressive avenue of Corsican pines and a flowers including orchids and bluebells. The village is located just to the south of Banbury where there are several good trails to try. The large village of Adderbury is also nearby. You could try our circular walk which visits the Sor Brook.",
