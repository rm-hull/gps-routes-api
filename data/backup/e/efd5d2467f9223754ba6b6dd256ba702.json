The nutrient-rich mud was pumped out, and an ecological intervention put in place - excluding fish from certain areas, in order to increase the population of Daphnia (water flea) and thereby control the algae. Lower algae levels mean clearer water, and greater plant growth, which in turn provides shelter for Daphnia from predation by fish. This photo shows one of the fish \"exclosures\" - below the floats, mesh curtains hang to the bottom of the broad."

The walk starts at the car park on Long Road (shown on the streetview link) and then follows Irstead road to the boardwalk. It's a nice easy stroll through the countryside on a good country lane. You'll see the boardwalk on your left after about 10-15 minutes. You then follow the boardwalk through dense woodland with various interesting species of plants. Look out for a variety of wildlife including common terns, otters, kingfishers and herons.",
