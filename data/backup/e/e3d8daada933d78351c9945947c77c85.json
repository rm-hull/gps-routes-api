  "description": "Enjoy waterside cycling and walking in this country park near Redruth in Cornwall. The route starts at the car park on the eastern side of the reservoir and runs right alongside the lake for most of the way. There is a short section along country lanes to Penmarth at around the half way point. For walkers the path runs around the whole of the lake but the cycle path runs for a shorter distance to the dam at the north end of the lake. The park is great for bird watching with a number of hides to use. There's also a splendid cafe and a watersports centre. To extend your walking in the area you can visit the lovely Kennall Vale Nature Reserve. Here you'll find nice woodland walking trails along the River Kennal and the ruins of Kennall Vale Gunpowder Works.",

      "content": "The lake is located to the south west of Truro. There's some nice trails along the Truro River to Boscawen Park and the pretty estuary at Malpas here. Truro is also notable as Cornwall's only city and includes a wonderful cathedral which is well worth a visit. The circular Great Flat Lode Trail can be picked up a couple of miles north of the lake. It's a shared cycling and walking trail which takes you to some of Cornwall's old mines and the historic hill top site of Carn Brea. Just a few miles to the east of Redruth there's some great walking and mountain bike trails to be found at the Poldice Valley. The area has a wonderful moon like appearance with the historic Poldice Mine buildings adding to the atmospheric landscape. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
