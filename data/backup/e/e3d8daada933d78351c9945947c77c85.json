  "description": "Enjoy waterside cycling and walking in this country park near Redruth in Cornwall. The route starts at the car park on the eastern side of the reservoir and runs right alongside the lake for most of the way. There is a short section along country lanes to Penmarth at around the half way point. For walkers the path runs around the whole of the lake but the cycle path runs for a shorter distance to the dam at the north end of the lake. The park is great for bird watching with a number of hides to use. There's also a splendid cafe and a watersports centre. To extend your walking in the area you can visit the lovely Kennall Vale Nature Reserve. Here you'll find nice woodland walking trails along the River Kennal and the ruins of Kennall Vale Gunpowder Works.",
