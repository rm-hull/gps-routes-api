  "description": "This district in West London is known as the \"Queen of the Suburbs\" due to its greenery. As such it's a pleasant place for a walk with Ealing Common and Walpole Park providing local walking opportunities. Other walking highlights include the lovely Brent River Park, located just to the north. The waterside trail takes you along the Brent River with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Near here you can enjoy some more easy waterside walking along the Grand Union Canal Walk. To the south there's the popular Gunnserbury Park and the Thames Path where you can explore the world famous Kew Gardens. This circular walk first explores Ealing Common where there are some pleasant footpaths to try. The common is located next to Ealing Common tube station which is on the Uxbridge branch of the Piccadilly line and on the Ealing Broadway branch of the District line. You then head west to visit Walpole Park. There's more nice trails here, taking you to a pond, lake and a picturesque walled garden. The park is also used for music festivals and a beer festival. There's a pleasant cafe where you could stop for some refreshment before heading back through the town to the tube station.",
