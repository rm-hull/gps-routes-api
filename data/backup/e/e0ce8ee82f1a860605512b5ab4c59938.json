  "description": "Enjoy woodland trails, heather covered hills and wonderful views over the Shropshire countryside and Welsh hills in this country park near Shrewsbury. Other features in the park include an Iron age hill fort and Kynaston's cave - a cave hewn into the sandstone, said to have been the hideout of medieval outlaw Humphrey Kynaston. It's a lovely area for walking and cycling with waymarked trails to follow through the woodland. You can continue your walking in the area by trying our Shrewsbury River Walk and visiting the delightful Quarry Park.",
