Other features in the park include an Iron age hill fort and Kynaston's cave - a cave hewn into the sandstone, said to have been the hideout of medieval outlaw Humphrey Kynaston. It's a lovely area for walking and cycling with waymarked trails to follow through the woodland. You can continue your walking in the area by trying our Shrewsbury River Walk and visiting the delightful Quarry Park.",

The inn has an interesting history dating back 1405 with their most notorious patron being Sir Humphrey Kynaston; Shropshire's answer to Robin Hood. From 1491 to 1518 Humphrey lived the life of a highwayman. He had a reputation of robbing the rich and giving to the poor, and in return the locals protected him giving him and his horse food. Today the pub serves good quality food and has a nice garden area for warmer days. You can find the inn at postcode SY4 1DB."
