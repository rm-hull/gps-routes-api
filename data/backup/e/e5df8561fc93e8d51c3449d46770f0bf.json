It was laid waste by Owain Glyndwr, with the support of Welsh loyalists, in his attempt to unite the disparate regions of Wales. As a result, the local population was subjected to the merciless reparations of Henry IV. Here the view is up the valley of the Tywi toward the northern hills of Esgair Ferchan and Mynydd Mallaen."

  "description": "This market town in the Cambrian Mountains has some nice riverside walks along the River Towy and River Bran to try. This circular walk takes you along the river before exploring the woodland and countryside to the south of the town. The walk starts at the train station in the town centre. The station is on the Heart of Wales Line Line\u00a042 miles (68\u00a0km) north east of Swansea and is located at Tywi Avenue. From here you can follow footpaths north west to the river and then turn south along the riverside path which also runs along the golf course. The path then leaves the river and heads east, crossing the River Bran, around Cwm-Rhuddan. You then follow some woodland trails north before returning to the town around Afon Bran at Llandovery Castle. The 13th century castle ruins occupy a knoll overlooking the\u00a0River Towy\u00a0with nice views of the surrounding countryside. After exploring the castle you head through the town centre before returning to the train station where the route finishes. The town is also located in the west of the Brecon Beacons where you can find lots of good walking trails. If you head a few miles to the south east you can visit the lovely Usk Reservoir . There's a nice cycling and walking trail running round the reservoir where you can also look out for Red Kites. Another nice idea is to catch the train north and visit the Cynghordy Viaduct . The impressive grade II listed 18-arch viaduct carries the route across the Afon Bran valley on a gentle curve. Also not to far away are the lakes of Llyn y Fan Fach and Llyn Brianne where you can access the glorious Tywi Valley .",
