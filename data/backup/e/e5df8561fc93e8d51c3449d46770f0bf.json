It was laid waste by Owain Glyndwr, with the support of Welsh loyalists, in his attempt to unite the disparate regions of Wales. As a result, the local population was subjected to the merciless reparations of Henry IV. Here the view is up the valley of the Tywi toward the northern hills of Esgair Ferchan and Mynydd Mallaen."

  "description": "This market town in the Cambrian Mountains has some nice riverside walks along the River Towy and River Bran to try. This circular walk takes you along the river before exploring the woodland and countryside to the south of the town. The walk starts at the train station in the town centre. The station is on the Heart of Wales Line Line 42 miles (68 km) north east of Swansea and is located at Tywi Avenue. From here you can follow footpaths north west to the river and then turn south along the riverside path which also runs along the golf course. The path then leaves the river and heads east, crossing the River Bran, around Cwm-Rhuddan. You then follow some woodland trails north before returning to the town around Afon Bran at Llandovery Castle. The 13th century castle ruins occupy a knoll overlooking the River Towy with nice views of the surrounding countryside. After exploring the castle you head through the town centre before returning to the train station where the route finishes. The town is also located in the west of the Brecon Beacons where you can find lots of good walking trails. If you head a few miles to the south east you can visit the lovely Usk Reservoir. There's a nice cycling and walking trail running round the reservoir where you can also look out for Red Kites. Another nice idea is to catch the train north and visit the Cynghordy Viaduct. The impressive grade II listed 18-arch viaduct carries the route across the Afon Bran valley on a gentle curve. Also not to far away are the lakes of Llyn y Fan Fach and Llyn Brianne where you can access the glorious Tywi Valley .",

      "content": "About 10 miles south west of the town you will find the interesting town of Llandeilo where there's some lovely trails through Dinefwr Park and two ancient hill forts on Garn Goch. Near here there's also Gelli Aur Country Park. The park surrounds the Golden Grove mansion and includes a deer park, peacocks, views of the Tywi Valley and an aboretum with some fine specimen trees. To the north there's the peaceful little village of Rhandirmwyn where you can explore the interesting old lead mines, the River Towy Valley and the local woods. Near the Usk Reservoir to the east, you can pick up the Epynt Way. This shared cycling and walking trail takes you around Mynydd Epynt in the MOD's Sennybridge Army Training Area. The Heart of Wales Line Trail passes through the area. The 143 mile trail explores the Heart of Wales Railway Line, a wonderful rural railway running between Swansea and Shrewsbury. The trail visit several train stations, old railway lines and photogenic railway viaducts. Heading north will take you to the impressive Cynghordy Viaduct and LLanwrtyd Wells. Just to the south is the village of Myddfai. The village is a popular place to visit with a 14th century Grade I listed church and an excellent, energy efficient visitor centre. You can climb east to Mynydd Myddfai from here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cambrian Mountains Walks and the Brecon Beacons Walks page."
