  "description": "This lovely small town sits in a fantastic spot on the Pembrokeshire coast. With the Carningli Mountain as a backdrop, coastal paths, a nice beach and some fine river estuary trails it's a splendid place for a scenic walk. This walk takes you along a section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to the lovely beach at Newport Sands. Here the waymarked path runs along the picturesque River Nevern Estuary. Along the way you'll pass the anicent Carreg Coetan burial chamber just before crossing Newport Bridge over the river. The chamber dates from around 3000 BC and is a scheduled ancient monument. The walk finishes at the Newport Sands beach where there's attractive sand dunes and the opportunity to wade across to Newport Parrog at low tide. To continue your walking around Newport follow the coast path west to visit one of the area's highlights at Dinas Head. The headland is a great place for sea birds and commands wonderful views towards the beautiful Llyn Peninsula .",

      "content": "Head north along the coast path and you could visit Ceibwr Bay. The beautiful National Trust owned area has some wonderful cliff tops with seals and dolphins to look out for in the waters below. Head south and you can try the climb to Carn Ingli in the Preseli Hills. It's a worthy climb with a number of fascinating ancient sites dating from the Iron Age and the Bronze Age. There's also some glorious views to the coast from the summit. There's a public car park just a couple of miles south of Newport where you can start the walk. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pembrokeshire Coast Walks page."
