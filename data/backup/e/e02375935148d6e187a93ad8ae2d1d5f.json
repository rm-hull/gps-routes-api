  "description": "This lovely small town sits in a fantastic spot on the Pembrokeshire coast. With the Carningli Mountain as a backdrop, coastal paths, a nice beach and some fine river estuary trails it's a splendid place for a scenic walk. This walk takes you along a section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to the lovely beach at Newport Sands. Here the waymarked path runs along the picturesque \nRiver Nevern\u00a0Estuary. Along the way you'll pass the anicent Carreg Coetan burial chamber just before crossing Newport Bridge over the river. \u00a0The chamber dates from around 3000 BC and is a\u00a0scheduled ancient monument. The walk finishes at the Newport Sands beach where there's attractive sand dunes and the opportunity to wade across to Newport Parrog at low tide. To continue your walking around Newport follow the coast path west to visit one of the area's highlights at Dinas Head . The headland is a great place for sea birds and commands wonderful views towards the beautiful Llyn Peninsula .",
