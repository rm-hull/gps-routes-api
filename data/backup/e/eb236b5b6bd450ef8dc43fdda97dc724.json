It was devised by Sir Robert Watson-Watt's Air Ministry research station near Bawdsey, Suffolk, and consists of radar fixed on top of a radio tower mast called a 'station' to provide long-range detection of aircraft. The Chain Home stations were arranged around the British coast, initially in the South and East but later the entire coastline, including the Shetland Islands. The system was dismantled after the war, but some of the tall steel radar towers were converted to new uses"

Boudica's Way is a 40-mile footpath that links Norwich and the market town of Diss on the Suffolk borders. The name Boudica (often spelled 'Boadicea', which was the Victorian version or 'Boudicca', used by Tacitus) derives from the Celtic 'bouda' which means victory. Boudica was the wife of the Icenian king Prasutagus. When he died his kingdom was annexed by the Romans. In AD 60 or 61 Boudica led the Iceni, along with others, in revolt. They destroyed Camulodunum (Colchester) and the site of a temple to the former emperor Claudius. Boudica was defeated in the end and is reported by Tacitus to have poisoned herself. The site where she is buried is unknown."

  "description": "This south Norfolk village is located just a few miles to the south of the city of Norwich in the River Tas Valley . This walk from the village follows a section of the Boudicca Way north to visit the Venta Icenorum Roman town at Caistor St Edmund . The walk starts in the village wher you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it north to Upper Stoke before coming to the roman town. You can explore the earthworks, ruined walls and ditches of the ancient site before a walk along the River Tas which runs through the area. To extend the walk head south west along the trail to visit the neighbouring village Saxlingham Nethergate.",
