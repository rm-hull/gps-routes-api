    "description": "This circular walk explores the Strinesdale Country Park and reservoirs in Oldham. In the park you'll find two pretty reservoirs with two colour coded walking trails to follow. There's also woodland trails, meadows and nice views of the surrounding countryside to enjoy. You can start the walk from the car park and visitor centre at the southern end of the site. As you make your way around the lakes look out for various birds including Herons and kestrels. The trail runs for just over a mile so should take around 30-45 minutes to complete. The Medlock Valley Way runs right through the park. You could extend your walk by picking up this waymarked trail and following it south to the River Medlock and the pretty Daisy Nook Country Park .",
