The church was damaged in 1943 by two German bombs (a crater can still be seen to the south of the church). There is no graveyard but three dogs belonging to the gamekeeper (about 1910) were buried under the large beech tree. This view was taken in spring when there was a lovelly display of daffodils."

  "description": "This is a circular walk around the historic Cockington Country Park and Cockington Village in Torquay, Devon. Cockington has 460 acres of beautiful country park to explore including ornamental lakes, woodlands and formal gardens. The 17th century Cockington Court has a number of studios open to the public with a variety of arts and crafts at the Court's Craft Centre. Also of interest is the Agatha Christie Literary Trail and the Murder Mystery Trail. The walk also passes close to the delightful Cockington Village with its thatched roofed cottages, cider orchards and quaint shops and tearooms. To extend your walking in the area you could try the Torquay to Babbacombe Walk along a lovely section of the South West Coast Path.",

      "content": "Head south along the coast path and you could visit Brixham on the Torquay to Brixham Walk. There's another fine country park here in the shape of Berry Head Country Park. In Torquay itself there's the popular Torquay Rock Walk. These elevated, Mediterranean style gardens command wonderful views across the town and the bay. On the northern side of the town you could visit the peaceful Brunel Woods. The site is named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel who loved the area and intended to set up home at Watcombe Park before he died. Just a few miles to the west there's Berry Pomeroy Castle to visit. Here you'll find the ruins of a 15th century castle surrounded by pleasant woodland trails. The site is run by English Heritage so there's good facilities with a car park, gift shop and cafe. The site can be reached by following the John Musgrave Heritage Trail west from the park. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
