Cockington Church is dedicated to St George and St Mary and whilst a chapel has existed here since Saxon times, the present structure dates from 1210. The church was damaged in 1943 by two German bombs (a crater can still be seen to the south of the church). There is no graveyard but three dogs belonging to the gamekeeper (about 1910) were buried under the large beech tree. This view was taken in spring when there was a lovelly display of daffodils."

  "description": "This is a circular walk around the historic Cockington Country Park and Cockington Village in Torquay, Devon. Cockington has 460 acres of beautiful country park to explore including ornamental lakes, woodlands and formal gardens. The 17th century Cockington Court has a number of studios open to the public with a variety of arts and crafts at the Court's Craft Centre. Also of interest is the Agatha Christie Literary Trail and the Murder Mystery Trail. The walk also passes close to the delightful Cockington Village with its thatched roofed cottages, cider orchards and quaint shops and tearooms. To extend your walking in the area you could try the Torquay to Babbacombe Walk along a lovely section of the South West Coast Path.",
