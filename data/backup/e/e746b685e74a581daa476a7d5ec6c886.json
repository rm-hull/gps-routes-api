  "description": "This Suffolk based market town has some nice trails along the Blyth River. It's also close to the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB where there are miles of excellent walking trails and a series of wildlife rich nature reserves to explore. The town itself has some interesting history with a walk down the Thoroughfare highly recommended. This pedestrianised area includes many buildings dating back to the sixteenth century. This walk from the town takes you east along the New Reach river and the River Blyth to Blyford. The walk starts just to the south of the train station where you can pick up a shared cycling and walking route along the New Reach. Follow the path east and it will take you to Mells and Blyford where you could stop for refreshments before the return leg. You could extend the walk by continuing east to visit nearby Blythburgh. Here you can visit the Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve and the Walberswick Nature Reserve. The historic village is also well known for the Grade I listed Holy Trinity Church, known as the Cathedral of the Marshes.",
