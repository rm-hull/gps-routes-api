It is Grade I listing for its exceptional architectural interest. This is the church viewed from the southeast on a sunny December morning. The churchyard is full of 18th and 19th century gravestones which, being made from Swithland Slate, are still completely legible."

  "description": "This walk explores the attractive Leicestershire village of Breedon on the Hill. The circular walk starts in the village and heads north to explore Breedon Hill. The hill is composed of Carboniferous limestone and rises to a height of 122 metres (400 ft). You can follow footpaths around the hill and past Breedon Quarry before returning to the village. From the top of the hill there are excellent views of the surrounding countryside. At the summit you'll also find The Bulwarks Iron Age hill fort and Breedon's historic Church of England parish church. The hill top building is something of a local landmark and contains some fascinating ancient sculptures.",
