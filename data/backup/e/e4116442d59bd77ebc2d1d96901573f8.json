  "description": "A walk from the West Yorkshire village of Oxenhope in West Yorkshire, visiting Leeming Reservoir and Thornton Moor Reservoir. The walk starts from Oxenhope station on the excellent Keighley & Worth Valley Railway. The heritage railway runs from Keighley to Oxenhope through the lovely Worth Valley on some classic old steam trains. From the station you can pick up the Bronte Way, a waymarked footpath which explores Bronte country. This section of the trail runs south east to Leeming Reservoir and Thornton Moor Reservoir which are located close to each other. There's nice footpaths running alongside the lakes with views across the water to the surrounding moorland scenery. You can extend the walk by continuing south east to Ogden Reservoir or heading north east to visit Denholme, Doe Park Reservoir and the interesting Hewenden Reservoir and Viaduct. This walk follows the same paths back to Oxenhope and the train station.",
