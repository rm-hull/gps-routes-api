  "description": "This circular walk takes you to the high point of the Malvern Hills at Worcestershire Beacon. The walk starts in Great Malvern, just to the west of the train station. From the Edward Elgar Statue you can pick up the Worcestershire Way to take you onto the hills. The route then heads to North Hill and Sugarloaf Hill before climbing to Worcestershire Beacon. From the 425 metres (1,394 ft) summit you can see 13 counties of England on a clear day. Other highlights includes views of The Wrekin , Cannock Chase, the Welsh border mountains, the Shropshire Hills and across the valleys of the Severn and Avon to the Cotswold Hills. After soaking in the views the route descends to Lower Wyche before returning to Great Malvern. To explore the full range of this beautiful area try our Malvern Hills Walk .",
