    "description": "This picturesque Somerset village is a lovely place for a stroll. There's a medieval moated castle, a 12th century church, lots of quaint old cottages and a pretty brook running through the centre of the village. This walk from the village visits Nunney Castle , Nunney Coombe and the neighbouring village of Whatley. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the Macmillan Way and follow the waymarked trail north along the Nunney Brook to Nunney Coombe. There's some nice woodland trails around here as you continue north to Whatley. Here there's a Vineyard and trails along Fordbury Water to the north of the village. The route then retraces its steps south before following an alternative public footpath to visit the remains of Nunney Castle. The moated 14th century castle was modernised in the late 16th century, and then besieged and damaged by the Parliamentarians in 1645, during the English Civil War. The site is now run by English Heritage and is free to access with a free car park, a short walk away, off Castle Hill. It's also notable as England's smallest medieval castle.",
