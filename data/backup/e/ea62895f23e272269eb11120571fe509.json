  "description": "This is a popular riverside walk from Barden Bridge to Bolton Abbey along a section of the Dales Way. Passing along the River Wharfe the route runs for about 3.4 miles so roughly a 7 mile walk there and back. You can start off from the public car park at Barden Bridge where you can visit the nearby Barden Tower. The medieval fortified tower dates back to the 15th century when it was originally a hunting lodge. The route then heads south east, passing Strid Wood where you will find a rushing waterfall. Shortly after you will come to the site of the fascinating ancient priory. Here you can explore the ruins of the 12th-century Augustinian monastery and pick up one of the colour coded nature trails. To continue your walking from the car park head west to visit Barden Reservoir where there's a lovely circular trail around the picturesque lake.",

Barden Tower has strong links to Lady Anne Clifford who renovated the building in the mid 17th century. You can pick up the Lady Anne's Way long distance trail at the site and follow it to other historic buildings connected to the Clifford family."
