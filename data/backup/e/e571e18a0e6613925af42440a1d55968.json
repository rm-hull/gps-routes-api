  "description": "Follow the towpath of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal on this easy walk or cycle in Somerset. The multi user path runs for about 14 miles from the Bridgwater Marina to Firepool Lock next to the River Tone in Taunton. It's a great way to see the lovely countryside and pretty villages of lowland Somerset. The route follows National Cycle Route 3 making it a great option for families looking for a safe cycle ride or walkers looking for an easy stroll. Along the way there's lots of interesting lock structures and old bridges to look out for. At Mansel lock you will find a fascinating scale model of the sun with planets set along the towpath for six miles in both directions, demonstrating the scale of the solar system. There's also a series of nice pubs and cafes where you can enjoy refreshments. The canal is great for wildlife with heron, moorhen, coot and a variety of dragonflies to look out for on the way. There's also lots of interesting plants and wildflowers in the summer months. The route starts at the pretty marina in Bridgwater and follows the canal south through the town and out into the countryside. You then pass the villages of North Newton, Creech St Michael and Bathpool, before entering Taunton. At Bridgwater you can pick up the long distance River Parret Trail to extend your walk. You can follow it north along the river to the beautiful Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve. In Taunton you can pick up the West Deane Way and head west along the River Tone towards Norton Fitzwarren.",
