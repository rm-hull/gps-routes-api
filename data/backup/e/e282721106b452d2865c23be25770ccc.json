  "description": "This large park in Preston town centre is a great place for a safe cycle or walk. National Cycle Network Routes 6 and 62 run through the park and there are miles of well surfaced footpaths to follow into the adjacent Miller Park. Highlights in the park include a pretty Japenese Garden and riverside paths along the River Ribble which runs through the southern section of the park. From the high points there are nice views to the Pennine Hills, especially the prominent Winter Hill. Other park features include a pond with a fountain, tree lined avenues by the river and a grotto with rockwork and a water feature. There is also an excellent riverside cafe where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. The Preston Guild Wheel cycling and walking route also runs through Avenham so there is scope for continuing your exercise. Heading west will take you to the Riversway Docklands and marina. If you head east you'll come to Fishwick Bottoms and the lovely Brockholes Nature Reserve with its large lake and abundance of wildlife. The park is located very close to Preston train station so is easy to get to by public transport.",
