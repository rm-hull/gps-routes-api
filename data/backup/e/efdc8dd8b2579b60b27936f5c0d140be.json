  "description": "Enjoy a nice stroll along the River Coquet on this easy circular walk in the popular village of Warkworth. The walk starts from the ancient bridge of two arches which crosses the river, just north of the castle. The medieval bridge also includes an old fortified gateway. Head west along the river and you will soon come to the noteworthy St Lawrence church. The large Norman church dates from the 12th century with construction started in 1132. It was built not only as a holy place but also as a sanctuary for the villagers in dangerous times, such as the battle of Alnwick in 1174. You continue around the bend of the river to Warkworth Castle. The substantial ruins of the medieval castle sit next to the river in a very photogenic spot. Follow the path along Mill Walk Wood to Howlet Hall where you leave the river and follow a footpath south. Another path then heads east taking you to the castle where the walk finishes. English Heritage own the site so you have to pay a fee to fully explore the castle. Upon entry you can see how the powerful Dukes of Northumberland, the Percy family lived. There's also great views of the river and coast from the castle walls. Part of this route uses the St Oswald's Way long distance footpath. You can extend the walk by continuing south west along the river to Felton. The village is located very close to the beautiful Northumberland Coast. You could pick up the Northumberland Coast Path and head north on our Warkworth to Alnmouth Walk. You could also head south east to Amble where the river joins the sea. There's fine views to Coquet Island and the lovely Druridge Bay Country Park to visit here.",
