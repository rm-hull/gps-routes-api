  "description": "This Gwynedd based town sits in a pleasant spot close to the mouth of the Afon Dwyryd. It is also located on the Ffestiniog Railway, a splendid heritage steam railway running into the surrounding Snowdonia National Park. This walk explores the area around Pont Briwet to the south east of the town. Here you will find some lovely footpaths along the River Dwyryd estuary. In this area there's some lovely views across the sandy/muddy estuary to the surrounding rocky hills and mountains of Snowdonia. The walk then continues east to visit the pretty Llyn Tecwyn Uchaf where there are more nice waterside paths and views. To continue your walking in the area head east to visit neighbouring Maentwrog Walk. Here you'll find the beautiful Plas Tan y Bwlch Gardens at the Snowdonia National Park environmental studies centre. It's a fine place for a walk with the picturesque Llyn Mair to see as well.",
