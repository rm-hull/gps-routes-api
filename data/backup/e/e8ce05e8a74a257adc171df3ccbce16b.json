    "description": "This circular walk explores Rosedale, a beautiful valley in the middle of the North York Moors. It's a fantastic area for walking with wonderful scenery in a peaceful, unspoilt environment. The walk starts in the delightful village of Rosedale Abbey. It's a lovely place with old stone houses, a village green and the ruins of the former Cistercian Priory which once stood on the site. The walk then follows good footpaths up towards North Dale before a woodland section through the Knottside Plantation. You continue across the moors, passing a series of impressive industrial ruins from the mining period of the area. The views across the moors are magnificent as you climb to a height of over 1300 feet. The return leg sees you descend past a series of farms and the village of Thorngill, before returning to Rosedale Abbey. To continue your walking in the area head west and try the popular Farndale Daffodil Walk . There's nice waterside paths along the River Dover with lots of pretty daffodils to see in spring. Rosedale also includes Blakey Ridge , where there's more great views and the lovely Lion Inn pub. The long distance Lyke Wake Walk runs just to the north of Rosedale Moor. It's a great way of exploring the North York Moors on foot, taking you across the nearby Danby Moor and Glaisdale Moor. Just to the south is the lovely village of Hutton-le-Hole where you can try our circular walk to Lastingham and Spaunton.",
