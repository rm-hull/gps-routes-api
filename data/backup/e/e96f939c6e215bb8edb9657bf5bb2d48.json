The Westbrook Stream which flows into the millpond from the north, brings a regular flow of small fish which attract diving birds and gulls. There's also a resident flock of non-breeding Mute Swans and plenty of ducks to feed. Other birds you may see include Tufted Ducks, Pochard, Goldeneye, Cormorant, Little Grebe, Great Crested Grebe and Red-breasted Mergansers"

The property is privately owned and does not allow for public access. It is a grade II* listed building and a scheduled Monument. The 12th century St Thomas \u00e0 Becket Church is also located in the village and worthy of some investigation."

  "description": "This attractive coastal town has some lovely walks along Chichester Harbour to try. This route takes you from Emsworth to Langstone Harbour along a splendid waymarked, coastal path. The walk starts at the train station and heads south to the marina, the photogenic mill pond and the old tide mill. You can then pick up a section of the Wayfarer's Walk and Solent Way long distance trails. These waymarked trails will take you west along a lovely section of the harbour, where you can look out for a wide variety of birds. Keep your eyes peeled for redshank, dunlin, shelduck and curlew as you make your way along the coastal path. After a while you pass the noteworthy remains of Warblington Castle. Originally home to a medieval manor, today, the turret, the arch of the gate and the drawbridge support in the moat still survive. The site has an interesting history having previously been the home of the Countess of Salisbury, who was executed at the Tower of London in 1541 under the orders of Henry VIII due to her disapproval of his marriage to her friend Catherine of Aragon. The route continues west to Langstone Harbour . Here you will find mudflats, salt water lagoons and a windmill. Together with Chichester Harbour, which is at the other (eastern) side of Hayling Island Langstone Harbour is designated as a Special Protection Area for wildlife. It's another popular spot for birdwatchers so make sure to bring your binoculars for this walk. The route finishes at the quay where you can enjoy refreshments and harbour views at the local pub, the Royal Oak. To extend the walk cross Langstone Bridge to visit Hayling Island . Our walk around the island visits Sinah Common, Ferry Point, South Hayling, Eaststoke Beach and the Sandy Point Nature Reserve. You could also continue west along the Solent Way to Farlington Marshes where you'll find a beautiful nature reserve with more wildlife to see. The Sussex Border Path passes through the town. Pick this up and head south to visit Thorney Island . This links with our Chichester Harbour Walk which further explores the AONB, visiting the delightful quay at Bosham.",
