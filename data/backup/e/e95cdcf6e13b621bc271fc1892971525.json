  "description": "This small reservoir is located near Meltham and Huddersfield in Kirklees. There are some nice footpaths running along the remote lake with fine views to the surrounding moorland and hills. The area is also good for bird spotting with various wildfowl visiting the lake. The Meltham Walk passes the water so you could pick this up to visit the nearby Butterley Reservoir and Wessenden Reservoir. There are also some public footpaths just to the west of the site on Holme Moor.",
