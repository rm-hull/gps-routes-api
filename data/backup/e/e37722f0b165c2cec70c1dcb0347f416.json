    "description": "This little Kent based village is a pleasant place to start a walk. It's located right on the North Downs with some lovely rolling countryside, local woodland and an historic abbey to visit. This circular walk from the village takes you up to the North Downs Way before exploring Boxley Wood and Boxley Abbey. The walk starts in the village and heads north to Boxley Wood where you can meet up with the North Downs Way . Head west past Harp Farm to Boxley Warren Nature Reserve before turning south to visit Boxley Abbey. The now ruined abbey dates back to 1146 when it was founded by William of Ypres. Today it's a peaceful and picturesque spot with the abbey ruins surrounded by some attractive open countryside, woodland and hill. After exploring the abbey the route then heads east to Harbourlands before turning north to follow the Centenary Way back to Boxley.",
