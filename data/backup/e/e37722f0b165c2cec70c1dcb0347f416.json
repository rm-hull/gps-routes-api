  "description": "This little Kent based village is a pleasant place to start a walk. It's located right on the North Downs with some lovely rolling countryside, local woodland and an historic abbey to visit. This circular walk from the village takes you up to the North Downs Way before exploring Boxley Wood and Boxley Abbey. The walk starts in the village and heads north to Boxley Wood where you can meet up with the North Downs Way. Head west past Harp Farm to Boxley Warren Nature Reserve before turning south to visit Boxley Abbey. The now ruined abbey dates back to 1146 when it was founded by William of Ypres. Today it's a peaceful and picturesque spot with the abbey ruins surrounded by some attractive open countryside, woodland and hill. After exploring the abbey the route then heads east to Harbourlands before turning north to follow the Centenary Way back to Boxley.",

      "content": "Head west from the village and you could enjoy a climb to the viewpoint at Blue Bell Hill. Near here there's also the ancient Coldrum Long Barrow and Trosley Country Park. The Long Barrow is about 3,000 years old and the only one in the Medway Valley to remain virtually intact. Just to the east there's another climb to Detling Hill near the neighbouring village of Detling. A couple of miles north east of the hill there's the popular Capstone Farm Country Park. The park has some nice trails around ancient woodland and a small lake. Just to the south of the hill you'll find the attractive village of Aylesford. Here there are a number of interesting sites to see including Allington Castle, Allington Lock, Aylesford Priory and the Museum of Kent Life. The open-air museum includes a thatched barn, an oast house and a farm with animals. The priory is also well worth a visit. Also known as The Friars this historic site dates back to the 13th century. You can explore the lovely grounds and take in the stunning medieval buildings, before enjoying walks down the Peace Garden and Rosary Way. To the east you can enjoy walks along the North Downs Way around the worthy village of Hollingbourne. The historic village includes over a hundred listed buildings including some fine timber framed structures on Eyhorne Street and the noteworthy All Saints Church which dates from the 14th century. There's also a splendid 11th century pub to investigate after your exercise. Just to the north of here there's also the lovely Hucking Estate which includes a Norman church, a waymarked sculpture trail and another fine country pub at the north western end. Just to the east there's the circular Bearsted Walk which visits the ruins of the 12th century Thurnham Castle in White Horse Wood Country Park. The village is also worth a visit with a nice village green, a 13th century church, a conservation area with many historic listed buildings and a 17th century pub to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Kent Walks and North Downs Walks pages."
