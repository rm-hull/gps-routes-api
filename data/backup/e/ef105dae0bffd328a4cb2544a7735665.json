Brocket Hall was built by James Paine in 1760, although there had been two previous buildings on the site, the first dating from 1239. It was the home of two Prime Ministers, Lord Melbourne and Lord Palmerston, who died at Brocket in 1865 while in office. It was later the home of the Baronets Brocket, the third Baronet converting it into a hotel, which is its current use. It is grade I listed."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you along the public footpaths surrounding Brocket Hall in Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. You'll pass around the beautiful estate, passing Lemsford and Cromer Hyde with woodland and country trails to enjoy. You can also visit the estate for afternoon tea though you must reserve in advance. See the link for more information. In the park there's nice walks along the Broadwater Lake and the River Lea with a fine 18th century Palladian bridge to cross on the way. The estate is also good for wildlife with Buzzards and Red Kites to look out for. Part of this route uses a section of the Lea Valley Walk. You could extend your walk by following the waymarked trail west towards Wheathampstead. Head south east and you will soon come to the Lemsford Springs Nature Reserve.",

      "content": "Pick up the Welwyn Garden City Walk and you could visit more of the area's highlights including Sherrardspark Wood, the Ayot Greenway and the 126 acre Stanborough Park. The waymarked Welwyn Garden City Centenary Walk also passes the site. Just to the north west of the town you will find the noteworthy village of Ayot St Lawrence. The village is notable for its connections with the playwright George Bernard Shaw and is the site of Shaw's Corner, his old residence. There's also a ruined 12th century church and a lovely pub which dates from the 14th century to see here. Near here there's Codicote where you can visit the nearby Hoo Park and enjoy some pretty bluebell woods and a rather fine old bridge over the River Mimram. The village is also very attractive with several timber framed buildings and a historic 16th century pub to admire. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hertfordshire Walks page."
