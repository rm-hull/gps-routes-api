  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll around this pretty park near the centre of Bedford. The park contains some nice mature woodland and a pretty lake with a fountain and ducks and swans. There is also a very good cafe. The John Bunyan Trail runs through the park so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Priory Country Park is located just to the east of the town centre. There's nice cycling and walking trails around the pretty lakes to enjoy here.",

This uses sections of the John Bunyan Trail and the Ouse Valley Way to visit the restored Stevington Windmill and the villages of Oakley and Pavenham. To the south east is the chocolate box village of Old Warden. The village is famous for the Shuttleworth Museum of historic airplanes and motor vehicles at Old Warden Aerodrome. The area also includes Old Warden Park where there are some lovely Swiss gardens, parkland walks and pretty lakes. For more walking ideas in the area see the Bedfordshire Walks page."
