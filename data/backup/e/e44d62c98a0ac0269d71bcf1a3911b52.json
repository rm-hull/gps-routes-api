  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll around this pretty park near the centre of Bedford. The park contains some nice mature woodland and a pretty lake with a fountain and ducks and swans. There is also a very good cafe. The John Bunyan Trail runs through the park so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Priory Country Park is located just to the east of the town centre. There's nice cycling and walking trails around the pretty lakes to enjoy here.",
