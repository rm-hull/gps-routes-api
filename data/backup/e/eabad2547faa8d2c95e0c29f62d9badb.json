  "description": "Visit the largest and most well preserved\u00a0neolithic\u00a0dolmen\u00a0in\u00a0Wales on this fascinating walk in Pembrokeshire. The walk starts from the Pentre Ifan car park and follows footpaths and country lanes to the burial chamber. It's an impressive sight with 7 principal stones including a 5 metre long capstone. Built around 3,500 B.C it is classed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. After leaving the dolmen the walk then heads to the delightful Pentre Ifan Wood where you can enjoy several woodland trails. Here you will find ancient oak trees, a variety of plants and around 400 species of lichen. From the woods it is a short stroll back to the car park.",
