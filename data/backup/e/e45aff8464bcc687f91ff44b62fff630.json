The dam at Pitlochry created Loch Faskally but reduced the height of this fall. The falls were originally so high that salmon were not able to jump up them and a very early example of a fish-pass was created so the salmon could bypass the falls. This fish-pass emerges beside the obelisk."

  "description": "This walk visits the National Trust's Linn Of Tummel near Pitlochry in Perthshire. It's a lovely scenic spot sitting at the confluence of the rivers Garry and Tummel. There's woodland trails, rushing pools and lots of wildlife to look out for too. Keep your eyes peeled for pine martens, otters and a variety of woodland birds as you make your way along the paths. The flora includes pearl-bordered fritillary and lily of the valley. You can start the walk from the car park and then head north west along the river to the Coronation Bridge. Here you can cross over to the other side and enjoy some woodland trails to the River Garry. Just to the east of the car park there's also the Clunie Power Station which is surrounded by attractive woodland and views of the surrounding hills. To continue the walk you could head north west to visit Loch Tummel and the majestic viewpoint at Queen's View. There's also more peaceful woodland trails in Tay Forest Park to the east. This area includes the climb to Craigower.",
