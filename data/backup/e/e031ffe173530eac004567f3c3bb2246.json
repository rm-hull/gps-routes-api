  "description": "This walk climbs to High Pike from the village of Caldbeck in the Lake District. The walk follows the Cumbria Way all the way from the village to the summit. As such the route takes place on good waymarked paths. It's about a 3 mile walk from Caldbeck to High Pike. From the car park in the village head south to Nether Row before climbing past Low Pike to the 658\u00a0m (2,159\u00a0ft) summit. Here you will find a trig point and \u00a0a substantial wind shelter which has been built from the stones of a ruined cottage. There are great\u00a0views of the\u00a0Solway Firth\u00a0and the\u00a0Scottish Border\u00a0hills to the north.\u00a0To the south are good views of Skiddaw\u00a0and\u00a0Blencathra. To extend your walking in the area try our Caldbeck Walk which visits the waterfalls along the beck before climbing to Brownrigg. You could also continue south along the Cumbria Way and climb to Skiddaw . Just to the south east is Carrock Fell which is often climbed as part of a circular walk with High Pike. Also nearby is the expansive Greystoke Forest where you will find miles of mountain bike trails and footpaths.",
