  "description": "This walk visits Malin Head, the most northerly point of mainland Ireland. The headland is located on the scenic Inishowen peninsula in County Donegal. There is a parking area where you can start your circular walk around the headland. Here you can enjoy fine views over the Atlantic to Inishtrahull Island to the north. Other features of the area include a Tower dating from 1805 and a weather station which features in the BBC Shipping Forecast. The area also includes Ballyhillion beach, a unique raised beach system of international scientific importance. Scenes from the film 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' were filmed in Malin Head. The Millennium Falcon could be seen perched on the cliffs with storm troopers roaming the hills. Actor Mark Hamill even visited Farren\u2019s Bar (See below) for some refreshments. To continue your walking in the area head south to explore the Mamore Gap. There's a good cycling and walking trail taking you through the Gap with great views of the surrounding hills and the Inishowen Peninsula.",
