  "description": "This walk visits Malin Head, the most northerly point\u00a0of mainland\u00a0Ireland. The headland is located on the\u00a0scenic Inishowen\u00a0peninsula in\u00a0County Donegal. There is a parking area where you can start your circular walk around the headland. Here you can enjoy fine views over the Atlantic to\u00a0Inishtrahull\u00a0Island to the north. Other features of the area include a Tower dating from 1805 and a weather station which features in the BBC Shipping Forecast. The area also includes\u00a0Ballyhillion beach, a unique raised beach system of international scientific importance. Scenes from\u00a0the film 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'\u00a0were filmed in Malin Head. The Millennium Falcon could be seen perched on the cliffs with storm troopers roaming the hills. Actor Mark Hamill even visited\u00a0Farren\u2019s Bar (See below) for some refreshments. To continue your walking in the area head south to explore the Mamore Gap . There's a good cycling and walking trail taking you through the Gap with great views of the surrounding hills and the Inishowen Peninsula.",
