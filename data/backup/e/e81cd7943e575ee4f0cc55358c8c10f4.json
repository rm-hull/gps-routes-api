  "description": "Visit this spectacular limestone gorge and enjoy a walk through the beautiful Nidderdale countryside. You can park in the village of Middlesmoor and then follow footpaths to the gorge about half a mile south. It's great for walkers with lots of public footpaths along the rushing river and through the surrounding woodland. The area also has an activity centre where you can try caving, rock climbing, abseiling and canoeing. After exploring the gorge you could extend your walk by picking up the Nidderdale Way and following it to the nearby Gouthwaite Reservoir or Scar House Reservoir .",
