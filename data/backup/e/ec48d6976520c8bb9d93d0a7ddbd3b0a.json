Bath is located roughly between the wooded ridge and Lansdown.  There is a popular walk to the ancient barrow of Kelston Roundhill starting from Kelston village. From the summit there are wonderful views to the Wiltshire Downs, the Mendip Hills and the Black Mountains of Wales. There's also a fine 17th century pub to visit in the village afterwards."

  "description": "Climb to Westbury Hill and visit the Westbury White Horse on this circular walk near Bratton in Wiltshire. The striking hill figure is 180 feet (55\u00a0m) tall and 170 feet (52\u00a0m) wide and has been adopted as a symbol for the town of Westbury, appearing on welcome signs and the logo of its tourist information centre. It is also considered a symbol for Wiltshire as a whole. From the viewpoint on Westbury Hill there are wonderful views over the Salisbury\u00a0Plain and the surrounding Wiltshire countryside. You can start the walk from the car park just to the south of the site near Bratton. Then follow the footpaths north to the lovely viewpoint. You can then pick up other paths along the ridge to the Iron Age hillfort of Bratton Camp.\u00a0Habitats include extensive chalk grassland where you can look out for the Adonis Blue Butterfly. The White Horse Trail , Wessex Ridgeway Trail and the Imber Range Perimeter Path all pass the hill so you could easily pick up these long distance footpaths to extend your walk. \nThe White Horse Trail is of particular interest. The waymarked circular trail starts at the Westbury White Horse and runs through Pewsey , Marlborough, Broad Town, Cherhill, Devizes, Steeple Ashton and Bratton. It also visits the Cherhill White Horse . Heading south along the Imber Range Perimeter Path will take you over Upton Cow Down to Warminster . You could start the walk from Warminster and follow the trail to the White Horse as an alternative route.",
