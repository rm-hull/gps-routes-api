  "description": "The attractive West Yorkshire village of Bramham is a fine place to start a walk with a splendid old park estate, pockets of woodland and country trails to explore. Bramham Park house and gardens are only open to visitors by appointment but there is a public footpath you can follow across the estate. The fine country house dates from the 18th century and is Grade I listed. The surrounding landscaped park includes a series of follies and avenues laid out in the 18th-century landscape tradition. This walk starts on the south western side of Bramham village and follows the path south west through the centre of the park. Here you'll pass woodland and temples before emerging onto Thorner Moor. You then cross the moor to visit the pretty neighbouring village of Thorner, using a section of the waymarked Leeds Country Way. You can extend the walk by continuing south along the Leeds Country Way to Saw Wood and the village Barwick in Elmet. Heading north will take you to Bardsey.",
