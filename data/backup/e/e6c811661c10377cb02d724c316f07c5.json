  "description": "This forest in Bracknell has miles of good walking trails and some good mtb trails as well. This circular route starts at the look out centre just to the south of Bracknell. From here you can follow trails heading south toward Bagshott Heath on the edge of Camberley. More trails then lead north past Rapley Lake and the Mill Pond before returning to the car park. In the park you will find the excellent Swinley Bike Hub which hires bikes and gives full details of the trails in the park. These include a Green Trail, Red Trail and Blue Trail. The trails are suitable for riders of all levels, from beginners to advanced. The forest is also a great place for wildlife with woodland birds including Nightjar, Dartford Warbler and Woodlark.",
