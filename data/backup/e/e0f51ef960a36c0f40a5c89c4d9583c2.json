  "description": "The village of Little Stretton sits in an enviable position in the Shropshire Hills. The pretty village has a popular campsite and a decent local pub making it a popular start point for walking in this beautiful area. This circular walk from the village, visits several of the highlights of the area including Ragleth Hill, Church Stretton, Carding Mill Valley and the Long Mynd. The walk starts in the village and follows paths east and then north to climb to the viewpoint at Ragleth Hill. There are fine views down to Church Stretton and across to the surrounding hills and countryside. After taking in the views you then descend into Church Stretton where you pick up the Jack Mytton Way. This will take you north west through the Carding Mill Valley. You continue past Bodbury Hill and Haddon Hill before picking up the Shropshire Way to take you up to Pole Bank on the Long Mynd. There's a toposcope here which details the many landmarks you can see from here. The path continues south before turning south east to follow a track across Minton Hill and Packetstone Hill to Minton. After passing through the small settlement you turn north to follow country lanes back into Little Stretton.",

The climb to Caer Caradoc is another popular local walk which can be started from nearby Church Stretton. The worthy village of Ratlinghope is located just west of the Pole Bank summit. It's a pretty place located on both the River East Onny and the Darnford Brook. You could explore the village, enjoy a waymarked circular climb to Adstone Hill and then head to The Bridges Pub which is in a lovely riverside spot. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Hills Walks page."
