  "description": "This walk climbs to the obelisk and hillfort on Wychbury Hill in the Clent Hills near Stourbridge . The walk starts on Pedmore Lane on the southern outskirts of Stourbridge. From here you can follow the Monarch's Way up to the hill top. Here you can enjoy fine views over the town below and further afield to the Severn Valley , the Malvern Hills and\u00a0the Clee Hills .\u00a0There's also the Wychbury Ring\u00a0Iron Age\u00a0hill fort which includes\u00a0a 28-tree ancient\u00a0yew\u00a0grove. The Wychbury or Hagley\u00a0Obelisk sits atop the hill and is something of a local landmark, being visible for miles around. The Grade II listed structure stands at a height of 84 feet (26\u00a0m). \u00a0It was commissioned as a family memorial and completed in 1758 at the same time as\u00a0Hagley Park\u00a0was being redeveloped in the fashionable\u00a0neoclassical\u00a0style. You can follow a circular path around the hillfort before returning to Pedmore Lane.",
