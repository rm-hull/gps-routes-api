  "description": "This walk climbs to the obelisk and hillfort on Wychbury Hill in the Clent Hills near Stourbridge. The walk starts on Pedmore Lane on the southern outskirts of Stourbridge. From here you can follow the Monarch's Way up to the hill top. Here you can enjoy fine views over the town below and further afield to the Severn Valley, the Malvern Hills and the Clee Hills . There's also the Wychbury Ring Iron Age hill fort which includes a 28-tree ancient yew grove. The Wychbury or Hagley Obelisk sits atop the hill and is something of a local landmark, being visible for miles around. The Grade II listed structure stands at a height of 84 feet (26 m). It was commissioned as a family memorial and completed in 1758 at the same time as Hagley Park was being redeveloped in the fashionable neoclassical style. You can follow a circular path around the hillfort before returning to Pedmore Lane.",

      "content": "Head south from the hill and you can extend your walking in the historic Hagley Park and the adjacent Clent Hills Country Park. Uffmoor Wood is located just a couple of miles east of the hill. There's some nice peaceful woodland trails to follow here. If you head north into Stourbridge you can pick up the Stourbridge Canal and enjoy a waterside stroll along to Hinksford. For more walking ideas in the area see the Worcestershire Walks page."
