  "description": "A walk on the Stackpole Estate taking you from the village of Bosherston to the beautiful Barafundle Bay. The route then takes you to the nearby St Govan's Chapel . If you just want to walk to the bay and back it's about a 5 mile round trip. The paths are fairly flat though there are some small climbs on the way. The walk starts from the car park in Bosherston and follows a trail along the lovely Lily Pools to North Hill. The route continues to Broad Haven where there are sand dunes and a beach. You then head east past Church Rock, Saddle Point and Raming Hole before coming to Stackpole Head. From here you head north west to Barafundle Bay where there is a beautiful beach, considered one of the best in the country. The walk then heads west across Stackpole Warren before heading up to St Govan's Head and the chapel. You can then climb down to the 6th century chapel where there is a window with fine views out to sea. The route then follows a country lane north back to Bosherston and the car park.",
