  "description": "This walk visits the Sloc of Dess Waterfall near Aboyne in Grampian. The secluded falls and surrounding woodland area a lovely place for a quiet walk. There's some roadside parking on the road next to the falls. Then follow the paths east down to the falls on the Dess Burn. Take care going down the hill to the waterfall as it can be tricky especially when wet. With a bit of effort you will soon come to the delightful spot which is generally very quiet and peaceful. There are other paths you can then follow around Dess Wood. The falls can also be approached from the east in Kincardine O'Neil where there is more parking available.",
