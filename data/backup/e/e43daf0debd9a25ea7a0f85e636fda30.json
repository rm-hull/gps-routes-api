  "description": "Follow in the footsteps of Bonnie Prince Charlie on this walk which traces the route of his march from Ashbourne to Derby in 1745. The path passes through Derbyshire farmland and woodland starting in Ashbourne town centre and heading south to Shirley via Osmaston and Osmaston park. You continue to Longford following the Shirley brook before turning east to Radbourne, where you will pass the 18th century Radbourne Hall. From here you head to Mackworth, passing the castle ruins, and entering the delightful Markeaton park on the outskirts of Derby. Just to the north of Mackworth is the delightful Kedleston Hall which is well worth a short detour if you have time. The final stretch runs into Derby finishing near the cathedral.",
