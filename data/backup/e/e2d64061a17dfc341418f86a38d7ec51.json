  "description": "This lovely town in the Scottish Borders has some interesting historic sites and some fine riverside footpaths. This walk in the town takes you along a section of the Jed Water river. The walk starts from the historic Jedburgh Abbey . The abbey dates back to the 12th century and includes some wonderful Gothic architecture and a picturesque cloister garden. From the abbey you can pick up a section of the Borders Abbeys Way and follow it north along Jed Water to the Townfoot Bridge, passing the old Canongate Bridge which dates to the 1500s. It's about a 1 mile walk so 2 miles there and back.",
