  "description": "This lovely town in the Scottish Borders has some interesting historic sites and some fine riverside footpaths. This walk in the town takes you along a section of the Jed Water river. The walk starts from the historic Jedburgh Abbey. The abbey dates back to the 12th century and includes some wonderful Gothic architecture and a picturesque cloister garden. From the abbey you can pick up a section of the Borders Abbeys Way and follow it north along Jed Water to the Townfoot Bridge, passing the old Canongate Bridge which dates to the 1500s. It's about a 1 mile walk so 2 miles there and back.",

      "content": "Head north along the Borders Abbey Way and you could visit nearby Kelso. There's Kelso Abbey and the ruins of Roxburgh Castle to see in this area. On the way you'll pass Harestanes where you can climb to the Waterloo Monument on Peniel Heugh hill and enjoy some fine views of the area. The Georgian Monteviot House and Gardens is also located in this area. Just to the south west of Harestanes there's Fatlips Castle where you can enjoy a climb to a splendid 16th century peel tower and enjoy wonderful views over Teviotdale. To the south there's Kielder Forest where you can visit Catcleugh Reservoir and Hindhope Linn. For cyclists the 4 Abbeys Cycle Route passes through the area. The circular trail uses a series of quiet country lanes to visit the same 4 abbeys as the Borders Abbey Way. Most of the route is also suitable for walkers. Just to the east of Melrose there's the climb to Scott's View to try. The viewpoint is named after Sir Walter Scott, author of novels such as Ivanhoe and Rob Roy. From here you can enjoy some wonderful views over the town and the surrounding hills and countryside."
