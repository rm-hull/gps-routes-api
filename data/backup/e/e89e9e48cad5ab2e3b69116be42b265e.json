  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Llyn Ogwen in the Snowdonia. You'll also visit the beautiful Ogwen waterfall at the western end of the lake. There's great views over the lake to the surrounding hills and mountains. The views of Tryfan are particularly good as it is located just to the south of the lake. You can start the walk from the Tryfan car park on the southern side of the lake. You then follow the lakeside pavement to the waterfall before picking up footpaths above the lake on the northern side. It's easy to extend your walking in this beautiful area. You can head up to the hanging valley at Cwm Idwal and visit Llyn Idwal on the way.",

It's open seven days per week for most of the year \u2013 opening only at weekends during the winter months. The popular snack bar can trace its history back to the early 1900\u2019s when it was precariously perched on rocks at the head of the waterfall from which it takes its name. Known throughout the world it has its place in the mountaineering history in this part of Snowdonia and has been run by the same family since 1953. It moved to its current location over forty years ago to the newer premises incorporating Snowdonia National Park warden office and public toilets. It sells a range of drinks, snacks, pasties, paninis and locally baked cakes. There's an outdoor seating area where you can enjoy your food with fine views of the surrounding mountains. You can find the snack bar between Llyn Ogwen and Llyn Idwal at postcode of LL57 3LZ for your sat navs."

The off road trail will take you north to the coast at Bangor, passing the splendid Penrhyn Quarry at Bethesda and the stunning glacial valley of Nant Ffrancon on the way. It runs mostly along old railway paths and the River Ogwen before finishing on the coast. The route is also suitable for walkers."
