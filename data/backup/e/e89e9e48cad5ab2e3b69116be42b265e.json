  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Llyn Ogwen in the Snowdonia. You'll also visit the beautiful Ogwen waterfall at the western end of the lake. There's great views over the lake to the surrounding hills and mountains. The views of Tryfan are particularly good as it is located just to the south of the lake. You can start the walk from the Tryfan car park on the southern side of the lake. You then follow the lakeside pavement to the waterfall before picking up footpaths above the lake on the northern side. It's easy to extend your walking in this beautiful area. You can head up to the hanging valley at Cwm Idwal and visit Llyn Idwal on the way.",
