  "description": "This Somerset based village is a nice place to start a walk with two significant waymarked trails passing through the settlement. This route uses sections of the Macmillan Way and the Monarch's Way to create a circular walk around the village. On the way you'll visit the scenic Corton Ridge and the neighbouring Sandford Orcas with its impressive manor house. The walk starts in the village and heads west along Ridge Lane to link up with the Monarch's Way. Follow the waymarked footpath south and it will take you along the Corton Ridge towards Stafford's Green Farm. The route then continues to Sandford Orcas Manor House. You continue south to Higher Sandford before turning north to Holway and Stafford's Green with Poyntington Down to your east. You then past the Wheat Sheaf Hill Reservoir before returning to Corton Denham.",
