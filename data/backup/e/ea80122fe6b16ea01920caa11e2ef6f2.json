    "description": "This circular walk takes you from Holywell to Crantock on the Cornish coast. The route runs for about 7.5 miles, first taking you along the coastal path to Crantock before returning through the countryside. The walk starts at Holywell at the sea front public car park. From here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it north through the huge dunes to Kelsey Head. You continue round Porth Joke, Pentire Point West and Crantock Beach before entering Crantock village. The beautiful beach is owned by the National Trust and is a popular place for sand dune walks and surfing. The route then heads west through the countryside to Treago Farm, Cubert Common and the Holywell Bay Golf Course before arriving back on the coast at Ellenglaze. The final section follows a path north along Penhale Sands before returning to the car park in Holywell.",
