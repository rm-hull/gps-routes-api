  "description": "This splendid, waterside cycle and walking route, runs along the River Clyde, from Glasgow to New Lanark, South Lanarkshire. The route starts in Glasgow\u2019s West End where the Rivers Clyde and Kelvin meet, and heads to Cambuslang via Glasgow Green and the Broomielaw. This section takes you through industrial areas with a number of interesting historical buildings. You then head into the countryside through Uddingston, Bothwell (passing the medieval castle) and Blantyre to the delightful Strathclyde Country Park. Here you follow the banks of Strathclyde Loch before following the river to Garrion Bridge, Dalserf and Crossford. The final section takes you from Crossford to the New Lanark World heritage Site and the Falls of Clyde Nature Reserve. The walk is waymarked with a blue fish logo. The river path forms part of our Glasgow to Balloch Cycle Route which takes you from the city centre to the banks of Loch Lomond on nice traffic free paths.",

Many of the murals are large, wonderful creations covering an entire side of a building. It's an impressive sight and a must do attraction for lovers of art and walking. Between Hamilton and Motherwell the river joins with the River Avon where you can enjoy a walk along the Avon Walkway.
