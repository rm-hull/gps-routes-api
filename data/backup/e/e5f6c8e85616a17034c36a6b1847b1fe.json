    "description": "This circular walk visits the lovely St Martha's Hill in the North Downs, near Guildford . From the high points there are tremendous views of the Surrey Hills and Newlands Corner . The walk starts from the St Martha's Hill, Guildford Lane Car Park, just east of the hill. You then follow the North Downs Way to the high point and the 19th century church of St Martha's. The hill summit stands at 574 feet (175 m) and commands wonderful views of the surrounding area. There are also a number of nice woodland trails, attractive grassland and a number of interesting plants. If you'd like to extend your walk then you could visit the nearby Newlands Corner for more great views and woodland footpaths.  Our 9 mile circular walk from the pretty village of Shere visits the hill after passing Newlands Corner. Just to the west is Chantry Wood where there are some more nice woodland trails and meadows to explore. From the eastern end of the woods you can enjoy a climb to Pewley Down . Footpaths leading south from the hill will take you to Blackheath Common where there's nice footpaths and cycle trails to follow through the attractive heathland and woodland.",
