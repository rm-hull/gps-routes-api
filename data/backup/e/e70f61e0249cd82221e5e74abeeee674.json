The parish lies on an upland spur of land with the valley of the By Brook to the south and east and a scarp slope to the north where the land drops steeply to North Wraxall. Much of the parish lies on limestone with Great Oolitic limestone in the north, which has been used for much of the local building. In the south, where the land falls away below the village, is an area of sands, rubbly limestone and some clay. Traditionally the higher land was used for sheep-rearing with corn and root crops grown on the lower."

  "description": "This pretty village is located in North Wiltshire, close to the city of Bath. There's some quaint cottages and nice footpaths taking you towards the Cotswolds countryside. There's also a 13th century church, a 17th century manor house and a decent 17th century pub to relax in after your exercise. All in all there are nearly 90 historic listed buildings in the village, an unusually high amount. This circular walk from Colerne takes you south to visit the neighbouring village of Box where you can enjoy a walk along the pretty By Brook. Along the way you will pass along quiet country lanes with some fine views of the surrounding lush countryside of the Cotswolds. The southern end of the route uses a section of the Macmillan Way. This waymarked long distance trail is a good way of further exploring the surrounding area on foot.",
