  "description": "This varied circular walk from Rosthwaite includes hill climbs, woodland paths, two beautiful tarns and nice riverside trails. The village is located in the popular Borrowdale area of the Lake District which is well known for its beautiful scenery. You can start the walk from the National Trsut run car park, located a few miles south of Derwent Water. From here you can pick up trails climbing north east to Watendlath Tarn. It's a lovely, peaceful spot with the adjacent hamlet of Watendlath worth exploring too. It includes an old packhorse bridge, and a National Trust tea-room, where you can sit outside and enjoy the wonderful views. From the tarn you can pick up a footpath heading south to Dock Tarn and Stonethwaite Fell. The route then picks up another waterside path heading north along the pretty Stonethwaite Beck. This will lead you back into Rosthwaite where the route finishes. After your exercise you can enjoy refreshments at the 18th century Royal Oak Hotel which is very walker friendly. The section along the Stonethwaite Beck passes along the Cumbria Way long distance footpath. You could extend your walking in the area by picking up the waymarked trail and following it south along the Langstrath Beck toward Langdale Fell. Our Langstrath Valley Walk follows the beck where you can see lots of pretty waterfalls dotted along the route. The Allerdale Ramble also passes through the area and is another good option.",
