  "description": "This expansive nature reserve in Leigh-on-Sea covers 257 hectares (640 acres). The site is located just a few miles along the coast from Southend and contains miles of nice walking trails. It's a lovely place with lots of little lagoons, pretty streams and great views across Hadleigh Ray to Canvey Island. There's a huge amount of flora and fauna to look out for on the island. Saltmarsh plants include Sea Purslane, Common Sea-lavender, Sea Arrow-grass, Common Saltmarsh-grass and Sea Aster. There's lots of birdlife with thousands of waders including Avocets, Curlew, Dunlin, Redshank and Grey Prover. You'll also see lots of butterflies around the plants and wildflowers in the summer months. Look out for Marbled White, Small Skipper and Essex Skipper as you make your way along the footpaths. The reserve is accessible with an on site car park and Leigh-on-Sea rail station within walking distance. Two Tree Island is located very close to Hadleigh Country Park where you can visit the ruined castle and explore the extensive grounds. The woodland trails and nature discovery centre at Belfairs Woods are very near to the park too. You could also cross the water to Canvey Island and enjoy a nice walk along the coastal path.",
