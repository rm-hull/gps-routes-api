      "caption": "Information board at entrance to Castle Eden Dene The board reads: Castle Eden Dene is the largest of eight very deep valleys, or denes which cut spectacularly into the gently rolling countryside of Eastern County Durham and run to the North Sea coast. Because of the comparative inaccessibility of the steep wooded valley sides, the denes have escaped clearance for agriculture, leaving them as precious remnants of ancient woodland. The combination of landscape and unusual soils formed in the magnesian limestone has created a variety of habitats within the denes and these have become home to a remarkable range of wildlife, particularly flowers and insects. Today the site is managed for the benefit of the unique wildlife that thrives here as well as for the thousands of people who visit each year."

The reserve covers 221 hectares of woodland and lowland grassland, where post-glacial melt waters have carved out some spectacular limestone cliffs and gorges"

  "description": "Enjoy miles of woodland trails, pretty streams, rushing waterfalls and an abundance of wildlife in this splendid nature reserve in Peterlee. The reserve is the largest area of semi-natural woodland in north-east England. There are well surfaced trails running along the pretty Castle Eden Burn and through the atmospheric gorge. There are two waymarked nature trails to try. The Yew trail runs for 2 miles following the Yew markers. On this trail you'll pass the reserve's majectic Yews and climb Craggy Bank where you can look out for nuthatches and goldcrests. The Squirrel trail also runs for about 2 miles following the squirrel markers. The reserve contains over 450 species of plant including wild garlic (ransoms) with their distintive aroma, pretty yellow primroses, lily-of-the-valley and bird's-nest orchid. In the spring months there are also carpets of bluebells to admire. It's great for wildlife too. Look out for roe deer, foxes and numerous different types of bird as you make your way along the trails. You can start your walk from the car park on Stanhope Chase. National Cycle Network Route 1 passes through Peterlee and close to the reserve if you would like to visit by bike. Please note that cycling is not permitted within the reserve though. This walk starts at the Stanhope Chase car park and explores the western section of the reserve. You can head east and walk all the way to the coast where you can pick up the Durham Coastal Footpath. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Castle Eden Walkway and follow the disused railway line to the lovely Wynyard Woodland Park. If you follow the coast path north towards Seaham you could visit the lovely Hawthorn Dene Nature Reserve. The coastal reserve has more nice woodland trails and interesting flora and fauna.",

      "content": "Hurworth Burn Reservoir is located just south of the reserve on the Castle Eden Walkway. It's a lovely place for a peaceful stroll with lots of wildlife to see and a good circular trail running around the perimeter. Head a few miles north and there's Hetton Lyons Country Park to explore. There's a fine lakeside cycling and walking trail here with good facilities including watersports and a cafe. On the western side of the reserve you can pick up National Cycle Route 14 and the Haswell to Hart Countryside Walkway. The multi-user trail uses the trackbed of a disused railway line to travel between the two old stations. For more walking ideas in the area see the County Durham Walks page."
