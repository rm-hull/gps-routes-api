  "description": "This pretty Suffolk village has lots of good options for walkers wishing to explore the area. The picturesque village includes a 15th-century church, the 13th-century Lavenham Priory and several half-timbered medieval cottages. This walk uses a section of the St Edmund Way long distance trail to take you through the village and then into the countryside along a disused railway line. You can use the trail to create a shorter circular walk by turning left at Park Road and continuing back into the village if you wish. The walk starts in the village centre and picks up the St Edmund Way to take you up to the railway line. Follow the trail west to Lineage Wood before skirting the edge of Kentwell Hall . Here you will find a 16th century stately home surrounded by beautiful gardens. At Kentwell Park you turn south to Melford Hall where the walk finishes. The hall includes beautiful landscaped gardens, a croquet lawn and the impressive 15th-century Holy Trinity church. Around here you can pick up the Stour Valley Path to extend your walk.",
