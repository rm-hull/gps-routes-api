  "description": "This pretty Suffolk village has lots of good options for walkers wishing to explore the area. The picturesque village includes a 15th-century church, the 13th-century Lavenham Priory and several half-timbered medieval cottages. This walk uses a section of the St Edmund Way long distance trail to take you through the village and then into the countryside along a disused railway line. You can use the trail to create a shorter circular walk by turning left at Park Road and continuing back into the village if you wish. The walk starts in the village centre and picks up the St Edmund Way to take you up to the railway line. Follow the trail west to Lineage Wood before skirting the edge of Kentwell Hall. Here you will find a 16th century stately home surrounded by beautiful gardens. At Kentwell Park you turn south to Melford Hall where the walk finishes. The hall includes beautiful landscaped gardens, a croquet lawn and the impressive 15th-century Holy Trinity church. Around here you can pick up the Stour Valley Path to extend your walk.",

      "content": "Our Lavenham Circular Walk is another good option, exploring the countryside to the east of the village before visiting Brent Eleigh and its noteworthy 13th century church. A few miles south east of Lavenham you'll find the delightful village of Kersey. It's one of the prettiest places in the county with medieval cottages, the famous Water Splash and a fine old timber framed pub. The circular Kersey Walk explores the countryside around the village and visits the little village of Lindsey on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Suffolk Walks page."
