  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Llyn Arenig Fawr before climbing to Arenig Fawr in the Snowdonia National Park. It's a beautiful area with lovely views of the nearby Llyn Celyn and great views of the surrounding countryside and mountains. Start the walk at the south eastern end of Llyn Celyn about half a mile east of Arenig. From here you can follow a footpath south to Llyn Arenig Fawr. The lake supplies water to the nearby town of Bala and the surrounding villages. It's a beautiful spot and generally very peaceful. Follow the path around the lake and continue west to climb Arenig Fawr. At the 854 m (2,802 ft) summit you will find a trig point and a memorial to eight American aircrew who died when their Flying Fortress bomber crashed on 4 August 1943. Some of the crash wreckage is still scattered across the hillside 300 m (330 yds) from the memorial location. There are splendid views to enjoy from the summit. On a clear day you can see Snowdon, Crib Goch, the Glyders, Tryfan and the Carneddau range. To extend your walking in the area you can visit Llyn Celyn where there's some nice footpaths along the water.",
