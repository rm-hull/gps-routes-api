      "content": "Widford School, encompassing both a primary school and a pre-school, serves around 60 pupils, with each year group having a capacity of up to 8 children. Established in 1875, the school has a long-standing history in education. The Village Hall, located on Bell Lane within the southern part of the parish, has been a community hub since its construction in 1910 by George S Pawle. Initially a drill hall for the Hertfordshire Regiment TA and later used by a Staffordshire Regiment, it transitioned to host village events. In 1956, the hall was acquired and renovated through a community fundraising effort, with subsequent care and maintenance by local volunteers. A new kitchen was added in 2009. It features a large function room with a removable stage for 100 people and a smaller committee room for 30 people. The Green Man, Widford's local pub, remained open thanks to a community campaign against its potential closure. Widford also has a disused single-platform railway station, part of the Ware to Buntingford Branch Line from 1873 to 1963. The railway, whose construction began in 1859 and completed in four years, now serves as a trail for walkers and cyclists. The station's site is currently used as a coal and garden product distribution center. The parish's allotments, comprising over 20 plots, were established in 1978 by the Widford Parish Council. St John the Baptist is the parish church in Widford. With its earliest parts dating back to the early 13th century and additional work in the late 13th and 14th centuries, it holds significant historical value. The church records, stored at the Hertfordshire County Record Office, date back to 1558. In 1903, burials in the church graveyard ceased when a new site across Ware Road opened. An independent, non-religious charity, The Friends of Widford Church, supports the church's care and maintenance."
