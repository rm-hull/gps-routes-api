  "description": "These expansive woods have miles of excellent mountain bike trails to try. The woods are located next to the village of Snailbeach, about 9 miles from Shrewsbury. There's a black trail (severe) and a red trail (difficult) so there's much to enjoy for the experienced rider. \u00a0Features include tough climbs, natural drops, rocks and very steep descents. This cycle route starts from Snailbeach but you could also start from the car park on the eastern side of the woods. This route is designed for cyclists but walkers can also enjoy a number of footpath in the woods. The site sits in an elevated position some 1100ft above sea level. As such there are splendid views of the surrounding Shropshire countryside from the high points. To continue your mountain biking in Shropshire head to Hopton Woods . There's several more black graded trails and a blue graded moderate route on nice wide paths for the less experienced rider. Walkers should head to Pontesbury and Pontesford Hill for more great views and challenging hiking.",
