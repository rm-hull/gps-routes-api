  "description": "Travel through the Colne Valley on this walk from Staines to Uxbridge. The walk starts by the River Thames in Staines and begins with a lovely section around King George VI and Wraysbury Reservoirs that takes you to Colnbrook. This section also passes across the delightful Staines Moor where you enjoy views of the Wraysbury River and River Colne. The area of grassland attracts grazing horses and cattle with a variety of birdlife around the streams and reservoirs. From Colnbrook you continue north with a waterside section along the River Colne with views of Little Britain lake. The walk finishes at Uxbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon. The trail also runs close to the pretty Harmondsworth Moor Country Park. Just to the east of Staines Moor the park has some nice footpaths and two lakes. The path also runs close to Runnymede Park in Egham. Here you can see the Magna Carta monument, enjoy woodland trails and visit the Langham Ponds wetland area.",
