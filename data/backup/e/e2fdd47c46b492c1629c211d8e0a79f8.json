  "description": "This area of ancient woodland near Chappel is a lovely place for a peaceful stroll. There is a car park off Tey Road near White Colne where you can pick up the public footpaths through the forest. In the springtime there are lots of pretty bluebells to enjoy. Look out for wildlife including deer, blackcap and nightingale. As an alternative to driving to the woods you could walk from the nearby village of Chappel where there is a train station. It's a really pretty village with an impressive viaduct, pretty houses, a mill and views of the River Colne. The Essex Way long distance walk runs close to the forest so you could pick this up to extend your walk.",
