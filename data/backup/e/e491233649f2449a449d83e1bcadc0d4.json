  "description": "This walk visits the Suffolk market town of Eye. It's an interesting place for a walk with several listed buildings including the beautiful old church and the ancient guildhall. There's also a fine 16th century pub and Eye castle which dates back to the 11th century. The town is located just a few miles south of the Norfolk town of Diss . This circular walk from the town uses sections of the Mid Suffolk Footpath and other public footpaths to visit the castle and the surrounding countryside. The castle was built shortly after the Norman conquest of 1066. It is one of just a few surviving motte-and-bailey castles from the early Norman period. You can climb to a splendid viewing platform and enjoy views over the town and the surrounding countryside.",
