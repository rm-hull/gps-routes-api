The STOOP circuit passes through Graveley, Walkern, the Beane Valley, Datchworth,  Woolmer Green, Knebworth Park, St Ippollitts, Little Wymondley and back to Graveley, using local footpaths and bridleways. Many of the villages are picturesque with pretty village greens and good local pubs to stop of for a bite to eat. One of the highlights of the walk is the delightful Knebworth Country Park . Famous for its music concerts you will also find a fine stately home surrounded by beautiful gardens. To continue your walking around Stevenage head into the town and visit the lovely Fairlands Valley Park . The Hertfordshire Way long distance footpath also passes through the area.
