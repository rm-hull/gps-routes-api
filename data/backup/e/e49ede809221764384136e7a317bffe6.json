  "description": "Follow the walking trails around this large park in County Armagh. The park is located near Lough Neagh and Dungannon. There's a number of good waymarked, colour coded walks taking you around the 680 acre site. The park consists of peatlands, orchards, woodland, boardwalks and two nature reserves. You can park at the car park and then follow the trails east through woodland to the pretty Derryadd Lake. There's lots of wildlife to look out for with butterflies, damselflies and birds such as meadow pipits and cuckoos. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could visit the nearby Oxford Island Nature Reserve. The large reserve is located on the shores of Lough Neagh and consists of reed beds, open water, species rich wet grassland, wildlife ponds and wildflower meadows. Just to the north is Marghery country park where there are another 3 miles of woodland walking trails with views over Lough Neagh. You can visit the park by bike by following National Cycle Network Route 94 and Regional Route 11 from Craigavon.",

There are wonderful far reaching views to enjoy from this elevated spot in the Ring of Gullion AONB. There's also the expansive Gosford Forest Park where there's miles of woodland trails, streams, waterfalls, ponds, grassland and a lovely arboretum to visit. Brantry Lough is another good local option. The picturesque lake is located near Dungannon and includes some pleasant waterside trails. Just to the north west you will find the historic town of Coalisland where you can enjoy an easy waterside stroll along the Coalisland Canal.
