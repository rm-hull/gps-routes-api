The brick building with the chimneys, in front of Canary Wharf, is the old Greenwich Power Station which used to be a back up to the London Underground."

Cycling is permitted on the principal roads through the park but cyclists are supposed to dismount at the narrow gate onto Maze Hill. The new barrier achieved that aim but made matters difficult for cyclists, mothers with prams etc. It was removed after a few weeks following complaints by users."

  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk through this large park in London. There's 180 acres of wide lawns, tree lined avenues, orchards and pretty gardens. There's also a beautiful 200m long herbaceous border\u00a0and a deer park with \u00a0Red and Fallow Deer. You can climb to the park's high points for great views of the River Thames, Canary Wharf, the\u00a0Isle of Dogs\u00a0and the\u00a0City of London. The park also houses The Royal Observatory, the home of Greenwich Mean Time, the Prime Meridian and London's only Planetarium. The observatory played a major role in the history of\u00a0astronomy\u00a0and\u00a0navigation. This circular route around the park is designed for walkers but you can cycle along The Avenue and Blackheath Avenue through the park. You can extend your cycle by heading to the River Thames and picking up National Cycle Route 1. Quietway 1 also starts from Greenwich. The Jubilee Greenway passes along the Thames to the north of the park. The 60km waymarked trail takes you on a tour of the capital's finest parks and most famous landmarks. At the Cutty Sark you can pick up the Waterlink Way which takes you south along riverside paths to Beckenham. From here you can also follow the Thames Path east and visit the famous Millennium Dome . You can virtually explore the park using the google street view link below!",
