  "description": "Enjoy an easy walk around the beautiful Charlecote Park in Wellesbourne, Warwickshire. It's a splendid place for a stroll with miles of footpaths taking you around the extensive estate. You can walk along the River Avon and see the waterfall before ambling around the large lake. Then cross the River Dene to the Deer Park where there are several fallow deer to observe. You can also explore the grand Victorian house. It has been home to the Lucy family for centuries with the park built in 1558 by Sir Thomas Lucy. See the porch built for the visit Elizabeth I and explore the Great Hall with centuries of Lucy family portraits. You can park at the provided car park or you could reach Charlecote from Wellesbourne by following a riverside footpath along the River Dene. National Cycle Route 41 runs to the park from Stratford Upon Avon so this is a great option if you'd like to visit Charlecote by bike. To extend your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Oakley Wood. Here you'll find some nice waymarked walking trails with ancient woodland, wildflowers and lots of wildlife to look out for.",

      "content": "You can reach the park from the village of Wellesbourne on the Wellesbourne Walk. It's about a 2 mile walk from the village, running along the River Dene. You can also visit the village's historic watermill beforehand. Head a few miles east from the park and you can visit a well known local landmark in the form of Chesterton Windmill near Harbury. The Grade I listed mill dates from the 17th century and is well worth a visit. To the west you'll find the viewpoint at Welcombe Hills Country Park near to the worthy village of Snitterfield. Shakespeare's Stratford Upon Avon is also not far from here. To the south east there's Compton Verney. The fine Georgian Mansion is surrounded by Capability Brown landscaped grounds with woodland, lakes, sculptures and some particularly impressive redwoods. The site also includes an award winning art gallery which is well worth a visit. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
