  "description": "This attractive Cambridgeshire based market town has some lovely riverside walking trails to try. There's also a number of attractive parks, Georgian buildings and a popular weekly market held every Wednesday next to the impressive town hall. This walk from the town takes you east along the old course of the River Nene to Shepperson's Bridge on the Twenty Foot River. It's a lovely place for a stroll with flat paths, lots of narrowboats and fine views of the surrounding countryside to enjoy. Part of the walk uses a section of the Nene Way. This waymarked long distance footpaths can be used to further extend your walk. You can link up with the Hereward Way and follow it south into the countryside too.",

Inside there's a charming interior with unusual carved beams said to have \"fallen off a barge\" during the building of Ely Cathedral. Outside there's a garden area where you can enjoy a view over the river and the boats with your meal. You can find them at 1 Nene Parade with postcode PE15 8TD for your sat navs."
