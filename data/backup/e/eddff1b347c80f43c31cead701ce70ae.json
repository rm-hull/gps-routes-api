    "description": "This short circular walk takes you around the pretty Herefordshire village of Shobdon. Starting in the village follow a public footpath north west to Downwood where you'll pass the Park Pool and Pearl Lake, the largest natural body of water in Herefordshire. Head east and you will come to Shobdon Park and Shobdon Court. The main house of the estate has since been demolished but the service wing and the stable block have since been converted to residential use.  The estate includes a noteworthy Grade I listed church. Arches from the interior of the church were removed in the 18th century to form an eye-catcher in the grounds of the Court. Here you'll also pass a Motte, designated as a Scheduled Monument and presumed to be an early Norman castle site. The route then turns south to pass more pretty pools before returning to the village.",
