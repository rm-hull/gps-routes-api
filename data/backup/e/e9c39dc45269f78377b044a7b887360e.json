The counter-weight is sufficiently light so that the bars shut into their horizontal position under their own weight. To photograph this I had to hold the thing open and then snap it quickly as it fell shut. Of course, the design leaves a rather large, and certainly not stock-proof hole under the counter-weight."

  "description": "This walk visits the Swanwick Lakes Nature Reserve in the Hampshire village of Swanwick. Here you can enjoy a series of footpaths taking you around the site's woodland, meadows and lakes which are made from the former clay pits. There's lots of wildlife to see with birds including marsh tits and woodpeckers. Wildflowers in the summer include\u00a0orchids and knapweed attracting lots of butterflies such as marbled white, meadow brown and gatekeeper. To continue your walking in the area head north over the River Hamble to visit Manor Farm and Country Park . There's some fine cycling and walking trails with 600 year old historic buildings including the 13th century St Bartholomew's church.",
