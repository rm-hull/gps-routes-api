  "description": "Climb Hasty Bank Hill and visit the fascinating Wainstones on this circular walk in the North York Moors. The Wainstones are a series of sandstone rocky outcrops with a number of interesting Bronze Age carvings. They are located near the village of Great Broughton and make for a splendid walking destination. This walk begins at the car park on Clay Bank Road and climbs Hasty Bank using the Cleveland Way National Trail. From the summit there are wonderful views of the Tees Valley and the nearby Roseberry Topping and Urra Moor. The route then descends on an adjacent footpath, passing Hasty Bank Farm before arriving back at the car park. This is a challenging walk but the footpaths are generally good and you are rewarded with truly wonderful views of the North York Moors for most of the way. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then simply continue west along the Cleveland Way and visit the Lord Stones. This country park also features a number of ancient stones with prehistoric carvings. There's also a fantastic viewpoint on Cringle Moor with a viewfinder detailing several landmarks you can see. The Lord Stones Cafe is a great place for refreshments with a good menu and outdoor seating. You could also head to the nearby Roseberry Topping and Captain Cook's Monument for more great climbing and fabulous views. The long distance Lyke Wake Walk passes the stones. The challenging walk is a complete crossing of the North Yorkshire Moors from west to east. The Urra Moor walk also starts from the Clay Bank car park so you could pick this up and head to Round Hill, the highest point on the North York Moors.",
