  "description": "This popular village sits in a lovely position on the coast in West Cornwall. It's a great place to start a walk with cliff top trails, beautiful beaches, a picturesque harbour and a wonderful freshwater lake to visit. Porthleven is also notable as the most southerly port in Great Britain. This walk from the village takes you south east along Porthleven Sands to Loe Bar and Bar Lodge before climbing to the H.M.S. Anson monument where there are some fine views over the area. The route uses a section of the waymarked South West Coast Path. You can extend the walk by visiting the National Trust's Penrose Estate where you can stroll along the large Loe Bar lake and enjoy woodland trails. The lake is a great place for bird watching with species such as Widgeon, Teal, Mallard, Tufted Duck, Coot and Shoveler to see.",
