  "description": "Mallow Castle is a National monument of Ireland located in Mallow, County Cork. The expansive site includes several historic buildings including a 16th-century fortified house, a 19th-century mansion, and the ruins of a 13th-century castle. The buildings are additionally surrounded by attractive gardens and parkland ideal for an afternoon stroll. There are also nice riverside walks along the River Blackwater which runs along the southern side of the site. On the eastern side there's a deer park with Mallow's famous White Deer. The original herd dates back to the late 16th century, when Elizabeth I gifted these distinctive deer to the Norreys family of Mallow castle.",
