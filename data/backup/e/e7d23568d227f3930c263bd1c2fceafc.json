  "description": "Explore 200 acres of rare heathland, mature woodland and species rich grassland in this country park near Mansfield. The park offers spectacular views across to Derbyshire and Lincolnshire and is home to an abundance of wildlife including herons, kingfishers, foxes, hares, tawny owls, nightjar and woodpeckers. There are also two bodies of water - Vicar Pond and Vicar Water. Vicar Water has super footpaths and bridleways making it ideal for a short cycle or walk. National Cycle Network number 6 runs through the park so you could continue your cycle along the Nottingham to Worksop cycle route. You could also visit the nearby Sherwood Pines Forest Park and enjoy several waymarked cycling and walking trails. Our Mansfield Cycle Route starts at Vicar Water and visits the splendid Clumber Park. It's a nice way to visit both parks on your bike in a day.",
