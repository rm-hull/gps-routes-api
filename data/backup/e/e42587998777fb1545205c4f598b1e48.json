  "description": "This pretty nature reserve in Telford includes copses, heaths,  grasslands, pools, scrub, wet woodlands and  oak capped mounds.  The park is located a couple of miles north of Telford town centre in Donnington Wood.  It's perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll with a variety of plantlife to see including Orchids, ox-eye daisy and cowslips. There are also splendid views of the surrounding countryside and a series of historic old mine buildings to see. The Hutchison Way walk passes through the park so there is the option of continuing your walk along this trail.",
