  "description": "This pretty nature reserve in Telford includes copses, heaths, grasslands, pools, scrub, wet woodlands and oak capped mounds. The park is located a couple of miles north of Telford town centre in Donnington Wood. It's perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll with a variety of plantlife to see including Orchids, ox-eye daisy and cowslips. There are also splendid views of the surrounding countryside and a series of historic old mine buildings to see. The Hutchison Way walk passes through the park so there is the option of continuing your walk along this trail.",

      "content": "Just to the west of the park you can pick up the Silkin Way in Telford. There's a number of pretty pools and the Town Park to explore in this area. You could follow the trail south and explore Ironbridge and Coalbrookdale on the River Severn. Just to the north west there's the lovely Aqualate Mere to explore. There's a pleasant waterside path to pick up at this large, scenic lake. The site is one of the area's highlights and notable as the largest natural lake in the English Midlands. Just to the west of here there's the interesting market town of Newport where you can enjoy another waterside stroll along the old Newport Canal. The Wellington Walk starts from the historic market town which lies just north west of Telford. It visits the wonderful viewpoint at The Wrekin and The Ercall Nature Reserve where there are some striking geological features to admire. The walk start from close to the town's bus station and train station making the area accessible by public transport. The town is also well worth exploring with its historic market and the splendid Victorian house and garden at the National Trust's Sunnycroft to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Walks page."
