The church was built c.1505, and the windows are unaltered in style from that date, although some have been renewed. Inside there is a 16C family pew, for the Cowmires, and another 17C one (altered in the 19C) for the Burblethwaites. There is a rare three-decker pulpit of 1698 and a possibly 13C wooden crucifix, rarer still. Also some 15C stained glass from Cartmel Priory, notably in the east window."

  "description": "This walk visits the village of Cartmel Fell from Bowland Bridge in the Lake District. You'll also enjoy a climb to the nearby Raven's Barrow described by Wainwright as \"a lovely belvedere for viewing a lovely valley\". The walk starts from the village of Bowland Bridge and follows country lanes south to Cartmell Fell with views of the River Winster. At Cartmell the route visits the noteworthy St Anthony's Church which is Grade I listed. It was built in 1504 as a chapel of ease to Cartmel Priory, and has changed little since. The walk then climbs west to Raven's Barrow where there are fine views from over the Winster valley to enjoy. The summit stands at a height of 500 feet (150 m) with additional views to some of the surrounding fells such as Whitbarrow and Sow How. You could extend the walk by continuing west a short distance to visit the pretty Sow How Tarn. This walk heads north east to return to Cartmel Fell before picking up the country lanes to return to Bowland Bridge. Back in Bowland Bridge head to the Hare & Hounds pub for refreshments after you walk (Postcode:LA11 6NN). The 17th century coaching Inn & Restaurant includes a lovely beer garden to sit out in during the warmer months. To continue your walking in the area head west to climb to Gummers How and enjoy wonderful views over Lake Windermere. Fell Foot Country Park is also nearby and has some lovely trails to try.",

The village also has a particularly fine dog friendly pub for post walk refreshments. Just to the east of Witherslack there's the Foulshaw Moss Nature Reserve. The reserve has some nice boardwalks to follow over the peat bog. It's also excellent for wildlife with ospreys, hobby, sparrowhawk, buzzard and peregrine to look out for from the bird hides."
