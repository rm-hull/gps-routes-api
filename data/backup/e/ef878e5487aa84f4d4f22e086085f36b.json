Here you can enjoy refreshments in the 360 cafe which offers fine views over the Avon Gorge and the city of Bristol. There's also an interesting museum and one of only three of the UK's working camera obscuras. In Saltford you could stop at The Riverside Inn. Located near the marina the inn is in a great spot. You can sit outside in the garden area and watch the boats go by along this canalized section of the river near Keynsham. They also have a good menu and an attractive modern interior. You can find them at the Shallows with a postcode of BS31 3EZ for your sat navs."
