  "description": "Tuckenhay is a pleasant little hamlet in South Devon. It's a nice place to start a walk with a fine local pub, a picturesque old mill and waterside trails along the Bow Creek, one of the River Dart tributaries. This circular walk starts from the car park of The Maltsters Arms pub where you can pick up a section of the Dart Valley Trail. Follow the waymarked footpath east along the Bow Creek and then turn south to visit the neighbouring village of Cornworthy. The route then heads west to Corkscrew Hill before crossing Tuckenhay Bridge and returning to the pub.",
