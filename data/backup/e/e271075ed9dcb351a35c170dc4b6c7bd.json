This walk takes you through the Cwm Llwch valley to this popular beauty spot in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The walk starts at the car park near the lake and involves a steep climb along the Cwm Llwch river to the beautiful lake. The surrounding scenery of the Brecon mountains is simply stunning.",
