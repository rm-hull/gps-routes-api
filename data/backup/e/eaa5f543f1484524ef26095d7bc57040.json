    "description": "This Derbyshire based village is a pleasant place for a walk with riverside trails and the expansive Allestree Park park to explore. This circular walk from the village explores the area to the north of the settlement, visiting the neighbouring town of Duffield and the River Derwent. The walk starts in the village and heads north along the Derwent Valley Heritage Way towards the river where you can enjoy views of the picturesque weir by the Peckwash Paper Mill. Continue north and you will soon come to the Makeney Road bridge which will take you over the river into Duffield. In the town you can enjoy pleasant walks around the Millennium Meadows Nature Reserve where there are views of the Rivers Ecclesbourne and Derwent. The area is also good for wildlife spotting with water loving birds to look out for on the rivers. From here you can pick up the Midshires Way and visit the ruins of Duffield Castle which dates to the 11th century. The route then retraces its steps to the bridge where you can pick up a section of the Centenary Way and follow it east to Eaton Park Wood. You then head south past Eaton Hill before returning to village.",
