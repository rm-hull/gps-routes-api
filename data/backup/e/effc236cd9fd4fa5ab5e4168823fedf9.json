It was given to the Benedictine religious order of Mont Saint-Michel by Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The site was was a destination for pilgrims, whose devotions were encouraged by an indulgence granted by Pope Gregory in the 11th century. The earliest buildings on the summit, including a castle, date to the 12th century."

  "description": "This fabulous walk runs from Lelant on the north coast of Cornwall to Marazion and the iconic St Michael's mount on the south coast. It's just over 12 miles with some moderate climbs on the way. You start in Lelant near St Ives, and head along the coast to Carbis Bay passing the beautiful Porth Kidney Sands on the way. The route then heads inland through the delightful Cornish countryside to Trencrom Hill where you can enjoy wonderful views of the surrounding areas. After passing Ludgvan you will soon arrive at the south coast near Penzance where the path turns east, taking you along the coast to the finish point in Marazion. Here you can visit the splendid St Michael's Mount or just enjoy the wonderful views from the coast. At the end of the route in Lelant you can visit the splendid Hayle Estuary RSPB reserves with thousands of wading birds to lookout for. For more information on this walk please click here .",

Here you can step back in time as you enjoy a drink in the place which Pirates and Smugglers once frequented some 750 years ago. It's the oldest pub in the town and includes an interior with real fires, wooden pews and a smugglers' tunnel. There's also a nice outdoor area for warmer days. You can find them at 49 Chapel St with a postcode of TR18 4AF for your sat navs."
