  "description": "Climb to this pretty tarn and enjoy wonderful views over Grasmere lake on this walk in the Lake District. The small tarn is very nicely positioned above Rydal and Grasmere. As such it's a popular and easily accessible climb with nearby car parks and bus stops on the A591 which runs below the site. Although it is quite a short climb the tarn is in quite a high position, reaching a height of over 1200ft or 365 metres. The walk start from the good sized White Moss Common car park off the A591 near Rydal Water and Grasmere Lake. You can also catch the bus from nearby Ambleside or Grasmere to White Moss if you prefer. The route heads north to White Moss Common , passing Lady Wood and White Moss Tarn. You continue past Dove Cottage, through Bracken Fell Wood to Grey Crag. The final section takes you from Grey Crag to the tarn where you can stroll around the water and take in the magnificent views. It's a good climb with tumbling streams and nice woodland trails. The route also passes close to Dove Cottage where William Wordsworth lived from 1799 to 1808. To extend your walk you could head east to Rydal Mount and Rydal Hall along the Coffin Route . Both Rydal Water and Grasmere Lake are also nearby, with waterside paths along them both. An alternative route to the tarn is to start from the village of Grasmere and head to Dove Cottage and pick up the footpaths behind the cottage.",
