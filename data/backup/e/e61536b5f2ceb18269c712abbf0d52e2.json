Seen here from the Welsh Road bridge, the River Itchen, a tributary of the Leam, is a muddy colour reflecting the heavy rainfall of the previous 48 hours. The name 'Itchen' is of interest; there is a larger and much better known Itchen in Hampshire, but virtually nothing is known of the origin of the word. It is believed to be pre-Celtic, but its meaning and significance are lost in the mists of time."

  "description": "The Warwickshire market town of Southam is located in the\u00a0Stratford-on-Avon district of the county. It's a nice area for walking with two rivers, woodland areas, nature reserves and the Grand Union Canal running just to the north. The town itself is also a pleasant place for a stroll with interesting architecture, including a mix of Tudor and 17th century buildings. This walk from the town explores the countryside to the west of the town before visiting Ufton Wood and the Ufton Fields Nature Reserve. On the way there's some nice countryside and views of the River Itchen and River Stowe to enjoy. The route starts in the tourist information centre in the town and heads west along the River Stowe to Stoney Thorpe Mill on the River Itchen. You'll pass the Holy Well, perhaps the most ancient holy well in the country. It was first mentioned in 998 and includes 18th\u00a0century and medieval features. You continue west past the same named farm and hall before skirting the edge of Ufton Wood and Long Itchington Wood. The path then comes into the village of Ufton, heading south into the Ufton Fields Nature Reserve. The reserve has some nice woodland trails, information boards and a small lake. It's a good spot to look out for flora and fauna. After exploring the reserve you head south east to Flax Hill before heading north east to Ufton Hill Farm. Shortly after you across the Leamington Road to return to Southam.",
