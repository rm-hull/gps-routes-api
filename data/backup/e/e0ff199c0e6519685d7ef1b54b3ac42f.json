  "description": "Enjoy a circular waterside cycle or walk around the delightful Draycote Water Country Park near Rugby. There is a flat 5 mile path surrounding the park's reservoir which ideal for cycling and walking (a section of the path is part of National Cycle Route 41 ). You can also climb Hensborough Hill for fabulous views of the surrounding area. The park has a visitor centre and a restaurant. The park is popular with bird watchers and includes a hide and feeding station. Look out for birds including the great northern diver during the winter months, along with kittiwake and small numbers of Mediterranean and little gulls. To continue your walking in the area you can head east to pick up our Circular Walk Around Rugby. This will take you along the Great Central Walk Nature Reserve and the Oxford Canal .",

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "Head a few miles south of the park and you can pick up the Grand Union Canal and enjoy another waterside stroll along the towpath. Near here you can also find the attractive market town of Southam. You can try the circular Southam Walk which visits the River Stowe, the River Itchen and the Ufton Fields Nature Reserve. There's also the picturesque village of Harbury where there's a 16th century timber framed pub and a 13th century church to see. A few miles to the south there's the worthy village of Napton on the Hill. Here you'll find a 12th century church and nice walks along Napton Reservoir and the Oxford Canal Walk. There's also a fine canalside pub for rest and refreshment after your exercise. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
