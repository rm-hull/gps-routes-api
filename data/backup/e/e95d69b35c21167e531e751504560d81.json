  "description": "This Buckinghamshire based town is in a nice location for exploring the Chiltern Hill AONB. There's also a pleasant local common and riverside trails along the River Misbourne which runs past the eastern side of the settlement. The town is accessible by public transport with services running into London in about 20 minutes. This short circular walk takes you around Gerrards Cross Common in the town. The walk starts on the common which is located just to the south of the train station in the town. There are then various footpaths you can follow around the common. Here you'll find two picturesque ponds and some nice woodland trails. You can extend the walk by heading a little west of the common to vist Bulstrode Park. There are public footpaths heading west past the Grade II listed mansion which predates the\u00a0Norman conquest.",
