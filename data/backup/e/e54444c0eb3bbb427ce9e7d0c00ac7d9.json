  "description": "This popular walk takes you along the dramatic Seaton Cliffs between Arbroath and Auchmithie on the North Sea coast. The area is geologically significant with towering red sandstone cliffs all along the path. The area is also a wildlife reserve so look out for seabird colonies and even dolphins as you make your way along the route. In the summer months you can also see lots of butterflies fluttering around the many wildflowers that grow on the cliff tops. The walk starts from the car park at St Ninian's Well Victoria Park about a mile east of the town centre and train station. Here you can pick up the coast path and follow it north to Carlingheugh Bay. There's some fine old red sandstone outcrops here including the Three Sisters. The next section takes you past the lovely Castlesea Bay before finishing in Auchmithie where there's a pretty harbour and a lovely beach about 120 feet below the village. At the end of the walk you can enjoy some well earned refreshments at The But 'n' Ben in Auchmithie. The popular seafood restaurant serves high teas plus Scottish dishes and seafood, including Arbroath smokies. You can then return to Arbroath on the same path or catch a bus back if you prefer. In Auchmithie you can extend the walk by picking up the Auchmithie to Lunan Bay Walk .",
