There had previously been a large farmhouse on the site dating from the 16th Century, and which, in the 17th century, was the home of Humphrey Jones, the Receiver General for North Wales. The property was acquired by the National Trust in 1994 and almost \u00a31 million pounds has been spent on restoring the house and outbuildings to create a residential and activity centre."

  "description": "This waymarked walk runs through the National Trust's Craflwyn in Beddgelert, Snowdonia. Hafod Y Llan is the National Trust's historically important hill farm on the south flanks of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon). The area is designated as a National Nature Reserve with choughs, peregrines and cuckoos to see. Also look out for the Welsh Black Cattle, Welsh mountain sheep and feral goats. The stunning walk will take you through the Nant Gwynant valley with fabulous views of the surrounding mountains. You'll also enjoy fine views of the area's two lakes - Llyn Dinas and Llyn Gwynant. The walk can be started from the public car park next to the Afon Glaslyn at the north eastern side of the route. Other features include some lovely river views and pretty waterfalls.",
