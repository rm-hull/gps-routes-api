  "description": "This walk uses waymarked walking trails to visit the Ashton Canal and the Gorton Reservoirs in Audenshaw, Manchester. It's a nice waterside walk, taking place on largely flat trails. The walk starts from the Guide Bridge train station which is right next to the canal in Audenshaw. You can pick up the towpath and follow it west toward Fairfield. Here you pick up the Tameside Trail and follow it south towards the reservoirs. You'll pass along the Upper and Lower Gorton Reservoirs before coming to Debdale Park where the route finishes. To extend the walk continue south on the Tameside Trail and you will soon come to Reddish Vale Country Park. The park contains a Visitor Centre, woodland trails, Community Orchard and Garden, Butterfly Conservation Field and a Dipping Pond. Highfield Country Park is also located in this area in Levenshulme.",
