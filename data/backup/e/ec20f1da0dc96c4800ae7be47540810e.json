  "description": "This town in Merseyside has some nice walking trails along the local canal and nature reserve. This route from the town uses sections of the Trans Pennine Trail and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. On the way you'll also pass the famous racecourse at Aintree and the delightful Lunt Meadows Nature Reserve which lies just west of the town. The route starts in Maghull where you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it south towards Melling and Waddicar. You then head west through Aintree, passing the racecourse which hosts the Grand National each year. The route then leaves the canal and heads north through Netherton to Sefton village where you could enjoy a rest at the fine local public house. The route then takes you through the Lunt Meadows, a peaceful wetland area where you can look out for a wide variety of birds. Near here you pick up the Trans Pennine Trail and follow it east back to the canal at Maghull. For more detail on the history and community of the town see the informative wikipedia wikipedia page.",
