  "description": "This route around Hunmanby makes use of the Wolds Way and Centenary Way to create a fine circular walk. You'll enjoy some splendid coastal scenery around Filey and lovely Yorkshire Wolds countryside for the duration of the walk. The route runs for about 10 miles on reasonably flat paths, with some moderate climbs around Folkton Wold. The walk starts from the large village of Hunmanby, in the Scarborough district of\u00a0North Yorkshire. The route begins by following the Centenary Way north east, through the countryside, to Filey. You then head north along Filey Bay with the option of continuing to the popular Filey Brigg Country Park . Here you will find a long narrow peninsula with steep cliffs and lovely coastal views. After exploring the coast you then pick up the Wolds Way National Trail to take you west through the town and back into the countryside. The trail leads south west through the village of Muston, before climbing towards Deedle Hill and Folkton Wold. There's some splendid views over the beautiful Wolds countryside from the high points. You then descend through Stocking Dale where you turn left to pick up the Centenary Way again. This will lead you back into Hunmanby where the walk finishes. To continue your walking in the area you could try the Filey to Bridlington Walk . It takes you along a beautiful section of Yorkshire coast, visiting several of the highlights of the area.",
