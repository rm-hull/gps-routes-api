  "description": "This short walk visits a series of lovely waterfalls in the Highlands. Rogie Falls are surrounded by attractive woodland with miles of forest trails. There's a car park very close to the falls where you can pick up the trails along the Black Water River to a viewing bridge suspended above the falls. It's a fantastic spot with the rushing waters surrounded by interesting rock formations with sloping trees. Look out for jumping salmon between June and October as they attempt to reach the upper parts of the river to spawn. To extend your exercise you can explore the Contin Forest where there are miles of cycling and walking trails to try. The woods are great for wildlife with roe and red deer, red squirrels, butterflies and various woodland birds to look out for. Just to the south of the falls is the delightful Loch Achilty. The pretty loch has a pebble beach and is surrounded by birch and oakwoods with lots of wildflowers in the summer.",
