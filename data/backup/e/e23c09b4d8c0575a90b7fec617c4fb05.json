    "description": "The village of Chalgrove is located in Oxfordshire, near to neighbouring Stadhampton and the city of Oxford. The pretty village includes a number of picturesque thatched cottages around a villlage green. This walk takes you to nearby Brightwell Baldwin and Brightwell Park. You can follow a pleasant lane south east to the nearby village, with fine views across the surrounding countryside. You'll also pass the historic Brightwell Park estate where there's some interesting old parkland and buildings. The old country house of the Stone family burnt down in 1786 but a cruciform 17th-century dovecote that was some distance from the house survives in the park. Part of the walk uses a section of the Shakespeare's Way . You could continue your exploration of the area on this waymarked, long distance walking trail. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Chalgrove. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
