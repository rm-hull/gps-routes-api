  "description": "This walk explores Shoeburyness on the eastern side of Southend in Essex. It's a pleasant place for a coastal walk with a beach, interesting old buildings, a nature reserve and fine views across the river estuary. The walk starts at the East Beach car park though the area also has a nearby railway station. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south west along the coast to the Shoebury Old Ranges. This is a designated nature reserve with some rare flora, unimproved grassland and ancient sand dunes. A footpath runs along the edge of the reserve though there is no public access in order to protect the area. There is also a military influence here with several MOD buildings and the old Shoeburyness Artillery barracks. The trail continues round to Shoebury Common where there are fine views across the River Thames estuary to the Isle of Grain on the other side.",
