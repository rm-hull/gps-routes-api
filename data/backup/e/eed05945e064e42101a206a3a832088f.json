  "description": "The area around this popular Shropshire Hill is fantastic for walking and cycling. This walk takes you to the 536 m (1,759 ft) Stiperstones summit where you can enjoy fabulous views over the surrounding area. The Stiperstones is a 6 mile/10km ridge covered with craggy rock outcrops and gorgeous heather heathland. The area is also a National Nature Reserve with a diverse range of flora and fauna. Look out for red grouse, Eurasian curlew, peregrine falcon and the rare ring ouzel as you make your way across the hills. This walk begins in Habberley taking you through woodland to the Stiperstones ridge. You head along the ridge passing the quartzite tors that Stiperstones is famous for. These include Shepherd's Rock, the Devil's Chair and Manstone Rock. Manstone is the highest at 536 metres (1,759 ft) and commands fabulous views over the Shropshire Hills, the Long Mynd and Wales. From here you return to Habberley on  different tracks, passing through a series of wooded areas as you go. If you'd like to continue your climbing in the area then you could head to the nearby Caer Caradoc and the stunning Long Mynd. This route also makes use of the Shropshire Way so you could continue along this path to the Bog Mine Visitor Centre where you'll find historical information about the area and two circular walks.",
