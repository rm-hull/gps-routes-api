In some areas, you'll find Scots pine and other conifer species introduced in the 20th century. The forest floor is seasonally carpeted with bluebells, especially in spring, creating stunning displays alongside wild garlic, primroses, and dog\u2019s mercury. Heathland and open glades within the woods support plants like heather, gorse, and grasses, while wetter areas host ferns, mosses, and sedges."

Blean Woods is renowned for its wildlife, particularly as a stronghold for the rare heath fritillary butterfly, often called the \"woodman\u2019s friend\" due to its historical association with coppiced woodlands. Other butterflies include white admirals, purple hairstreaks, and brimstones. Birdlife is abundant, with nightingales, woodpeckers (including great spotted and green woodpeckers), treecreepers, and warblers commonly seen. The woods are also home to long-eared owls, buzzards, and sparrowhawks. In winter, you may spot flocks of fieldfares and redwings. Mammals include badgers, foxes, roe deer, and smaller species like wood mice and shrews. Bats such as the pipistrelle and brown long-eared bat can be seen hunting insects at dusk. Amphibians like common frogs and newts thrive in the wetter areas, while reptiles such as common lizards and grass snakes are found in sunny, open spaces."

  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking paths in the ancient woodland of Blean Woods near Canterbury. The site is one of the most extensive areas of broadleaf woodland in Britain and home to a wide variety of wildlife. There's miles of waymarked trails to try with birds such as Nightjar and Woodcock to look out for on the way. To continue your walking in the area you can head south and try our Canterbury Rivers and Woods Walk which takes you through the orchards and woodland surrounding Canterbury. The Stour Valley Walk and North Downs Way long distance trails also pass just to the south of the woods.",
