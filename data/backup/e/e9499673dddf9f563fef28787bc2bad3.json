The upper floor was used as a studio by the Reverend John Thomson, landscape artist and minister of the church from 1805-40.He named his studio 'Edinburgh', allowing his housekeeper to say that he had 'gone to Edinburgh' if a parishioner called when he was painting. It lies on the shores of Duddingston Loch, a nature reserve near to Holyrood Park and below Arthur's Seat."

The front faces north and is very difficult to photograph."

  "description": "This walk takes you around the pretty Duddingston Loch near Holyrood Park\u00a0in Edinburgh. You can start the walk at the car park on the northern side of the loch. Then follow footpaths along the lake and through Dr Neil's Garden . These pretty botanical gardens sit next to the loch. The secret garden includes conifers, rhododendrons, azaleas, ponds and many other flowering plants. There's also the adjacent Duddingston village to explore. Here you'll find a 14th century pub and Duddingston Kirk church, which dates from the 12th century. On the southern side of the water there's the Bawsinch Nature Reserve where you can look out for a variety of birdlife. To extend the walk head north and enjoy a climb to Arthur's Seat for views over the loch.",
