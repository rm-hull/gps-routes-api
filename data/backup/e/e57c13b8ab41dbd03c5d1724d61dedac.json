    "description": "This Bedfordshire based town is located just to the east of Milton Keynes. The accessible train station in the town is a good place to start a walk with waymarked footpaths to follow into the countryside, woodland and heathland which surround the town. This walk from the town uses sections of the Milton Keynes Boundary Walk and the Greensand Ridge Walk to visit Bow Brickhill Woods , Aspley Woods and the splendid Woburn Park . The walk starts from the train station where you can pick up the Milton Keynes Boundary Walk and follow the waymarked footpath south and then west to Aspley Heath and Woods. The expansive woods have miles of good walking paths and some fine mountain bike trails to explore. Continue south to Lowe's wood where you can pick up the Greensand Ridge Walk and then head east to Woburn village and Woburn Park. The wonderful deer park has miles of trails to follow around several pretty lakes and ponds.",
