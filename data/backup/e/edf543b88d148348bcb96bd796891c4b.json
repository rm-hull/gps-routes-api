  "description": "This pretty North York Moors village is a fine place to start a walk. In the village there's lots of picturesque cottages, views of the Ings Beck and the noteworthy St Mary's Church. The ancient church is well worth investigating with its exquisite interior and an eleventh-century crypt. This circular walk from the village takes you north along the Lastingham Ridge up to the Ana Cross. The wayside cross marks a medieval route way across the moor between Lastingham and the site of Rosedale Priory.\u00a0The current cross dates from 1949 with the original moved to St Mary's church mentioned earlier. From the elevated position of the cross there are wonderful views across the moor. The route then heads south across Spaunton Moor before descending back to the village. You could extend the walk at the northern end by continuing north into Rosedale where you could explore the historic abbey. Near here there's also Rosedale Chimney Bank where you can explore the wonderful old kilns at Bank Top and explore the old mineral railway on the Rosedale Railway Walk . A small detour to the west would take you to neighbouring Hutton-le-Hole where you could visit the excellent Ryedale Folk Museum .",
