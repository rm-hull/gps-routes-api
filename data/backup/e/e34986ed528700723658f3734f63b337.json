  "description": "Enjoy a stroll along the River Avon on this peaceful waterside walk in Amesbury. The circular walk starts from the car park just south of the town centre, near Amesbury Abbey. You can then pick up public footpaths along the river towards Normanton before returning through fields to the car park. To extend the walk try our longer Woodford Valley route. This 8 mile walk takes you to the lovely village of Great Durnford with its riverside mill and picture postcard thatched cottages. The famous Stonehenge is only about a couple of miles west so you could easily walk there from Amesbury. See the Amesbury to Stonehenge walk for full details. Also nearby is Durrington Walls and Woodhenge. You could park at the public car park there and walk down to the stones on an alternative route. See the Woodhenge to Stonehenge Walk for more details. The long distance Salisbury Country Way passes Amesbury so this is another good option for extending your walk.",
