  "description": "Enjoy a stroll along the River Avon on this peaceful waterside walk in Amesbury. The circular walk starts from the car park just south of the town centre, near Amesbury Abbey. You can then pick up public footpaths along the river towards Normanton before returning through fields to the car park. To extend the walk try our longer Woodford Valley route. This 8 mile walk takes you to the lovely village of Great Durnford with its riverside mill and picture postcard thatched cottages. The famous Stonehenge is only about a couple of miles west so you could easily walk there from Amesbury. See the Amesbury to Stonehenge walk for full details. Also nearby is Durrington Walls and Woodhenge. You could park at the public car park there and walk down to the stones on an alternative route. See the Woodhenge to Stonehenge Walk for more details. The long distance Salisbury Country Way passes Amesbury so this is another good option for extending your walk.",

Here you'll find the splendid Bridge Inn. The main attraction here is the lovely, large riverside garden area where you can relax and enjoy refreshments in an idyllic setting. Indoors there's a nice light country-style decor with sofas too. They also have a very good menu and drinks selection. You can find the inn a couple of miles south of Stonehenge, in Upper Woodford, right next to the River Avon. Postcode for your sat navs is SP4 6NU."
