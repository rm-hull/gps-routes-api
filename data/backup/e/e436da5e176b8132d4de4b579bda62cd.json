  "description": "This coastal town is located near Swansea in the county borough of Neath Port Talbot. There's some excellent walking near the town with the Kenfig Pool Nature Reserve, Margam Country Park and the lovely Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes local highlights. This walk takes you along Aberavon Sands in the town. The attractive sandy beach and promenade are a nice place for an easy stroll. The beach runs for 3 miles and is lined with a number of cafes and pubs where you could stop off for refreshments. There's good views north towards Baglan Bay and south towards Margam. You could extend the walk by heading along the River Afan at the eastern end of the prom. A shared walking and cycling route runs along the river towards the docks.",
