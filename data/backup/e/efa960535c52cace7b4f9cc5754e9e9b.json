  "description": "Explore beautful Farndale on this lovely circular walk in the North York Moors National Park. The 'wild' daffodils of Farndale are very well known and attract large numbers of visitors in the spring. The River Dove runs through the area with the pretty daffodils lining the riverbank. The lovely valley is also surrounded by some splendid, wild moorland scenery. You can start the walk from the Low Mill car park and follow the River Dove north to Church Houses. This is roughly the halfway point on the walk and a nice place to stop for refreshments at the local pub. The route then returns to the car park on a mixture of footpaths and country lanes. On this section there's some moderate climbing with lovely views over Low Blakey Moor. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then head a few miles to the east and visit Rosedale. It's another beautiful valley with the ruins of the former Cistercian Priory of Rosedale Abbey to see. You can also explore the area on our Blakey Ridge Walk which climbs to the 1,300 feet (400 m) summit for great views over the moors. To the north of Church Houses you can pick up two of the long distance trails which run through the Farndale. The Lyke Wake Walk can be followed west across Farndale Moor or east towards Glaisdale Moor. The Esk Valley Walk will take you north across Westerdale Moor.",
