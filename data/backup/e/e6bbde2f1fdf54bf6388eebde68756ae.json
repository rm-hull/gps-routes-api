Originally it would have been open on three sides, the black wooden slating being a later security addition. The thatched roof gives the impression of being an iron age house rather than an industrial building. The large saw frame is inside along with a couple of circular saws, ranging from Norwich built to Rochdales Stenner and Gunn. The crane on the right serves a small steam engine milling machine."

  "description": "This walk visits the fascinating Gunton Park Sawmill before heading to nearby Suffield and the pretty Antingham Ponds. The walk starts from the Sawmill entrance just to the north west of Suffield and east of Erpingham. You can stroll down to the 19th Century Water Powered Sawmill which is still in working order. Dedicated volunteers are on site to tell you all about the history and workings of the mill. It was built in 1824 to provide sawn timber for the 12,000-acre (4,900 ha) Gunton Hall Estate. The site is very picturesque with a hipped thatched roof of the local Norfolk reed. It is powered by the Hagan Beck and the only surviving water powered sawmill in Norfolk. There are also lovely views across the adjacent Saw Mill pond from the site. After exploring the mill the walk then skirts the southern edge of the largely private estate, passing Suffield before visiting the village of Antingham and its pretty fishing ponds. The route then heads up Elderton Lane where you will arrive at the park entrance. The hall itself was built for Sir William Harbord, 1st Baronet in the 1740s by the architect Matthew Brettingham. The estate is private but there are nice views from the country lanes surrounding it. The walk then returns to the Sawmill on the same paths.",

This includes a room formerly occupied in the 1890s by society beauty Lillie Langtry with photographs of her and her lover The Prince of Wales, who was later to be King Edward VII. The marble in the bathrooms was found in Egypt by Robert Kime and came out of derelict mansions in Alexandria. There's a large outdoor area where you can enjoy views of the deer in the next field. You can find them at postcode NR11 8TZ for your sat navs."

      "content": "In Antingham you can pick up the Paston Way long distance footpath. You could follow the waymarked trail north to Southrepps and on to the coast at Overstrand. Here you can pick up the popular Cromer to Overstrand Walk or the Cromer to Mundesley Walk. This walk visits the pretty coastal village of Mundesley, located a few miles east of Antingham. Head a few miles south east and you will soon come to the town of North Walsham. Here you can pick up the North Walsham and Dilham Canal and enjoy an easy waterside stroll.
