  "description": "This walk visits two pretty reservoirs from the village of Maerdy in Rhondda Cynon Taf. The walk starts in the village and heads north along the River Rhondda Fach to the Lower Reservoir. You continue north passing some lovely waterfalls before coming to the Lleust-wen reservoir. It's a beautiful spot with the pretty lake surrounded by attractive woodland and grassland. The last part of the walk runs along a section of the Coed Morgannwg Way, a waymarked long distance trail running through the area. You could follow the trail east to Dare Valley Country Park if you felt like extending the walk. If you were head north west you would soon come to the splendid viewpoint at Rhigos Mountain .",
