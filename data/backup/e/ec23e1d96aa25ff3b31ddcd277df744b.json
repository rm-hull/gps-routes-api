  "description": "This walk visits the Hallington Reservoirs in Northumberland, near Hexham. You can reach the two reservoirs by following a pleasant country lane north from the little village of Hallington, using a section of the St Oswald's Way. After about half a mile or so another footpath branches off to the west, leading to the reservoirs. Here you can follow a causeway between the two reservoirs, with lovely views over the water. The area is also good for flora and fauna with attractive Scots pine woodland to enjoy. Look out for wildlife on the water including wigeon, teal and dunlin. You can extend the walk by continuing north west to Little Swinburne and Colt Crag Reservoir, where there's another pleasant waterside trail to try.",

Just to the north of Colt Crag there's Sweethope Loughs where you'll find two nice fishing lakes with woodland and waterside paths. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northumberland Walks page."
