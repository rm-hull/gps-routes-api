  "description": "This riverside village in South Oxfordshire is ideally located for walking with two National Trails passing through the area. Both The Ridgeway and the Thames Path head through the village and are a great way to explore the river and the surrounding countryside. The noteworthy village was named Oxfordshire's Village of the Year in 2009 and also has an interesting church with parts dating from the 13th century. This circular walk uses both waymarked trails to take you along both sides of the River Thames. You'll pass through two counties as in this area the river bisects Oxfordshire and Berkshire. Starting on the eastern side of the river at Goring Bridge, the route first heads north along the Ridgeway to South Stoke and North Stoke. At Mongewell you cross to the other side, although you could continue to nearby Wallingford if you prefer. On the western side of the river you pick up the Thames Path and follow it south. You'll pass the Berkshire settlements of Moulsford and Streatley, before crossing Goring Bridge to return to Goring. At Streatley you will pass the lovely riverside Swan Inn, which is a great place to sit outside and enjoy refreshments in the summer months. To continue your walking in the village you can pick up the The Swan's Way long distance trail. The shared cycling and walking trail starts in Goring and runs all the way to Salcey Forest . You can also continue along the Ridgeway and explore the surrounding Chilterns countryside. Our Streatley Circular Walk will take you up into the hills to the west of the village. Heading south along the thames will take you to Pangbourne and the lovely Mapledurham House .",
