  "description": "Explore 321 acres of open parkland, woodland and formal \ngardens on this cycle or walk near Derby. In the park you will find the 17th century Elvaston Castle surrounded by delightful gardens with stables, kennels, a walled garden, a home farm, several cottages, gatelodges, an ice house and a boathouse. In the country park there are a number of footpaths and bridleways to follow while National Cycle Route 6 also runs through the park. There is also a Nature Reserve where you can follow a number of footpaths to reed bed areas, wildflower meadows, wet woodlands, a lake and islands. The River Derwent runs very close to the park so you can follow the riverside path into Derby to extend your walk or cycle. Also nearby is Kedleston Hall . This much larger park features grassy meadows, serpentine lakes, pleasure grounds, woodland and contoured hills. Allestree Park is also well worth a visit for walkers. Covering 320 acres the park is the largest Local Nature Reserve in Derby. The long distance Bonnie Prince Charlie Walk also runs through the area. Follow it into Derby and it will take you close to the historic Darley Abbey Park .",
