  "description": "This short circular walk in the Norfolk village of Fleggburgh visits Filby Broad in the Trinity Broads. There's nice views over the water, attractive woodland areas and lots of wildlife to look out for. This includes Great spotted woodpecker, Marsh harrier, Egyptian geese and Grey heron. You can start the walk from the village hall car park near the church of St Margaret's. Then pick up the footpaths heading south through farmland to Little Broad on Burgh Common. The paths then turn towards Filby Broad with a path leading along the broad towards a caravan park. You can then follow the road back into the village.",
