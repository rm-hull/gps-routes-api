      "caption": "The Monument.  Wigton was originally a wool trading town, but now its major employer is Innovia films. In the market place is an elaborate 19th Century fountain erected in 1872 by George Moore of Whitehall in Mealsgate, in memory of his wife. It is built of granite, and features four fine bronze reliefs of the Acts of Mercy by the Pre-Raphaelite sculptor Thomas Woolner. On the north side (opposite the Kings Arms) is 'Visiting the Afflicted', the east illustrates 'Clothing the Naked', the south has 'Instructing the Ignorant', and the west side has 'Feeding the Hungry'. Above each bronze is a small granite carving of the face of Mrs Moore, surrounded by leaves."

  "description": "This Cumbrian based market town is located on the edge of the Lake District in Allerdale. It's an attractive and historic place, located on the River Wampool and Wiza Beck. There's lots of old buildings, a vibrant range of shops and several friendly local pubs for refreshments after your exercise. The Solway Coast AONB lies just to the north west of the town. There's some lovely walks here with several long distance trails to pick up in the area. These include the Allerdale Ramble, the Cumbria Coastal Way and Hadrian's Wall Path. To the north is the city of Carlisle where you can explore the grounds of the historic castle and enjoy waterside walks along the River Eden. This little circular walk in the town takes you along the Speet Gill and Kirkland Lane where there's some nice countryside views. See the list below for other walks near and around Wigton.",
