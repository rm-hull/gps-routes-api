  "description": "This circular walk visits the Ashgill Force waterfall in the North Pennines. The walk starts from the village of Garrigill just to the north of the falls. From here you can pick up the South Tyne Trail and follow the shared cycling and walking trail south to Low Crossgill and the Ash Gill. You follow the gill east and it will soon take you to the waterfall. The rushing falls are very pretty and you can even venture behind them for a splendid alternative view although take great care if you do. They plunge 55 feet over a rocky shelf and are particularly impressive after wet weather. There's also a series of lovely cascades downstream from the falls themselves. After enjoying the falls you can follow alternative footpaths north west to Windshaw Bridge, Snapper Gill and Garrigill.",
