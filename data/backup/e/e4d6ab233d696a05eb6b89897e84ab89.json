  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the lovely Langsett Reservoir on the edge of the Peak District National Park. The walk starts in the village of Langsett and follows footpaths through the woodland and open moorland around the reservoir. There is some climbing involved, though you are rewarded with splendid views across the Peak District. Most of the route is on well maintained, signed paths. Other highlights on the route include the ruined farm buildings at North America, views of the Little Don River and some delightful woodland paths. There is also a small climb to Hingcliff Common on the south western side of the water. From here there are lovely views back down to the reservoir and the village. The Barnsley Boundary Walk runs past the reservoir so you could pick up this trail and head east to the nearby Midhope and Underbank Reservoir, or west towards Winscar Reservoir. You could also head south past Hingcliff Common, Mickleden Edge and the Midhope Moors to visit the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower Reservoirs in the High Peak. The Langsett to Ladybower Walk 10 mile route will take you across the heather clad Howden Moors to the reservoirs. Langsett Reservoir is located close to both Stocksbridge and Sheffield.",
