  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful circular walk around this reservoir in Weardale. There's a parking area at the south eastern tip of the water where you can start your walk. Follow the trails around the reservoir where there are some woodland trails and lakeside paths to enjoy. It's a very quiet place with a series of picnic tables where you can stop to enjoy the lovely scenery of the North Pennines AONB. You extend your walking in the area by exploring Burnhope Moor and climbing to Burnhope Seat, the highest point in County Durham. You can also pick up the Weardale Way long distance trail, just to the east of the reservoir. Here you can enjoy a riverside walk to Wearhead and Gowshill. To continue your reservoir walking head south to Cow Green Reservoir and Cauldron Snout where there's nice waterside trails and a visit to a beautiful waterfall.",
