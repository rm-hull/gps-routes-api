  "description": "This reservoir near Penzance and Newlyn has a nice footpath to follow along the western side of the water. The walk visits the reservoir before heading to the pretty Trewidden Gardens on the eastern side of the water. The walk starts from the public car park on the southern side of the reservoir, next to the dam. From here you can pick up country lanes and bridle tracks to take you north to Sellan and Skimmel Bridge. Here you can visit the Trewidden Gardens where there's some lovely trees, flowers and ponds to see. After exploring the gardens the route then retraces its steps back to the car park. You could extend the walk by heading a short distance north east from the reservoir to visit the lovely Trengwainton Gardens .",
