A notable landmark along the river is the Round Hill, a large earthwork covered by a stand of mature pine trees. This site holds historical significance as the location of the first monastic settlement in Lismore, founded by St. Carthage in the 7th century. St. Carthage, guided by a local woman's prophecy, established the settlement on Round Hill, which he named \"Lios Mor\" (meaning \"great fort\" in Irish). The monks who followed Carthage built small beehive huts along the riverbank, and the settlement grew into a prominent religious and educational center, often referred to as a great university city in medieval times. The site remains an important historical and spiritual landmark, reflecting the deep religious and cultural heritage of the area."
