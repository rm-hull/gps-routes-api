  "description": "This Devon based town is located in a good spot close to the Dartmoor National Park and the River Teign Valley. This circular walk from the town visits Chudleigh Rocks, Ugbrooke Park and the Castle Dyke Iron Age Hillfort. The walk starts on the south west of the town where you'll find Chudleigh Rocks and Caves. A small part of the cave is open to the public as a show cave. The remains of the old Bishop's Palace can also be found in this area. The route then follows footpaths south past Lawell House and Winstow Cottages before following a country lane east along the edge of the Ugbrooke Estate. The gardens and grounds at the house are generally open to visitors during the summer season. Near here there's the Castle Dyke Hillfort. The fort is situated on a Hilltop at approx 140 metres above sea level, the south east of the town. The route then turns west back through the town, crossing the Kate Brook on the way.",
