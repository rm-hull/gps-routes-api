  "description": "This Devon based town is located in a good spot close to the Dartmoor National Park and the River Teign Valley. This circular walk from the town visits Chudleigh Rocks, Ugbrooke Park and the Castle Dyke Iron Age Hillfort. The walk starts on the south west of the town where you'll find Chudleigh Rocks and Caves. A small part of the cave is open to the public as a show cave. The remains of the old Bishop's Palace can also be found in this area. The route then follows footpaths south past Lawell House and Winstow Cottages before following a country lane east along the edge of the Ugbrooke Estate. The gardens and grounds at the house are generally open to visitors during the summer season. Near here there's the Castle Dyke Hillfort. The fort is situated on a Hilltop at approx 140 metres above sea level, the south east of the town. The route then turns west back through the town, crossing the Kate Brook on the way.",

      "content": "Just to the south west you can visit one of the highlights of the area at Stover Country Park. There's lots of footpaths here taking you to woodland, heathland, grassland and lakes. You can also pick up the Stover Canal and follow it to nearby Newton Abbot. Just to the east there's some nice trails on Ideford Common or you could pick up the River Teign Walk near the town. Just to the east you can explore the expansive Haldon Forest Park where you'll find some good mountain biking trails and the lovely Mamhead Sensory Trail which commands fine views over the Exe Estuary. At the northern end of the forest you will find Haldon Belvedere (Lawrence Castle). The site is used as wedding venue but is also open to the public on certain days. The fine looking castle dates from 1788 and is surrounded by some the lovely grounds and gardens. See the Doddiscombsleigh Walk for more details. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dartmoor Walks and the Devon Walks pages."
