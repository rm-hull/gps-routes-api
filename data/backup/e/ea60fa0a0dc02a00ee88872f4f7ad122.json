  "description": "This lovely valley in the Cumbrian section of the Yorkshire Dales is a great place for a peaceful, waterside walk. It can also be made into a challenging circular walk by climbing Castle Knott Hill and Calf Top Hill. The circular walk starts from the village of Barbon which is located just a few miles north east of Kirkby Lonsdale. The Barbon Beck runs through the village to the River Lune, about one mile to the west. After leaving the village you climb to Eskhome Pike, Castle Knott Hill and Calf Top Hill. It's a challenging climb with Calf Top Hill reaching a height of 609m (2000 ft). From the high points there are splendid views of the surrounding fells and countryside. The route then descends from Calf Top to Hanging Clint and Rowel Gill. Here you pick up the much easier path along the beck through Barbondale. On the way you'll pass a series of pretty waterfalls and a woodland section at Barbon Manor. For an easier walk you can just take the southern section of the path along the Beck which is very flat. To extend your walking in the area you could head to Kirkby Lonsdale, pick up the Lune Valley Ramble and enjoy another waterside walk along the River Lune. You could also follow the Limestone Link to Hutton Roof Crags and Farleton Fell where you will find some of the finest limestone pavement in the country.",
