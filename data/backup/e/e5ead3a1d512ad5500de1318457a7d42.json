This is a remarkably attractive structure considering it is made out of concrete blocks! The blocks are huge, typically 5ft x 3ft x 2ft, but varying to allow for the tapered columns. There are 12 arches in total, each one spanning 60ft. Of these 12, four arches actually span the river (not 6 as you will find reported elsewhere). The engineers were R. Church & William Robert Galbraith and the bridge was constructed between 1904 and 1908."

  "description": "This walk explores the beautiful grounds of a Tudor house near Saltash, before heading to the nearby village of Calstock. Outside the house you will find formally planted terraces, the Valley Garden with medieval stewpond and dovecote, the Upper Garden and two orchards. The River Tamar also runs through the grounds where you can stroll along the pretty Cothele Quay.\u00a0Here you will find the Discovery Centre where you can find out about the interesting history of the quay. In the 19th century paddle steamers would pass and vessels would stop to load and unload their cargo at Cothele. You can also explore the Tudor house with tapestries, arms and armour, pewter, brass and old oak furniture. The wide estate covers 1300 acres so there is plenty of scope for extending your walk. There are miles of walking paths taking you to woodland, fields, industrial ruins and working farm buildings. Highlights include the Prospect Tower which you can climb for splendid views of the Calstock Viaduct, Kit Hill and Plymouth Sound. The tiny Chapel-in-the-Wood was used by\u00a0Richard Edgcumbe to hide from King Richard III's men in 1483. After exploring the estate you can pick up a country lane heading east into Calstock where there's a lovely quay. There's also a train station served by trains on the\u00a0Tamar Valley Line\u00a0from Gunnislake to\u00a0Plymouth. Connections with main line services can be made at Plymouth, although a small number of Tamar Valley services continue to or from\u00a0Exeter St Davids. The Tamar Valley Discovery Trail also runs past Cothele so you could continue you walk along the river too. Also nearby is the lovely Kit Hill Country Park where you can climb to the hill summit and enjoy fabulous views over the Tamar Valley and Dartmoor.",
