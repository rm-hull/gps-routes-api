  "description": "The Illey Way runs along an old railway line from Waseley Hills Country Park to Woodgate near Halesowen. The well defined trail runs through some nice countryside and woodland passing Illey Pastures and Illey. You can start the walk from the Waseley Hills car park. It's a lovely park with 150 acres of rolling hills, pastures and woodland with panoramic views over Worcestershire from Windmill Hill. The trail then heads north through the countryside, passing the village of Illey before finishing at Woodgate near the pretty Woodgate Valley Country Park. Here you will find 450 acres of rich meadows, woodland and small ponds with the Bourn brook running through the heart of the park.",
