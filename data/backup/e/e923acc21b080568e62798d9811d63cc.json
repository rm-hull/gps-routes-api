  "description": "This route from the Oxfordshire village of Sutton Courtenay uses part of the Thames Path and other public footpaths to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. The route starts in the picturesque village which includes many noteworthy historical buildings. This includes the 12th century Norman Hall and The Abbey a medieval courtyard house which is Grade I listed. It's a great place to start a walk with several classic village pubs to enjoy rest and refreshment in afterwards. From the village head north to Culham where you can cross the river at Culham Lock. The route then follows the waymarked National Trail east, to Clifton Hampden Bridge where you cross back to the other side of the water. You continue east towards Burcot before turning south to follow public footpaths towards the village of Long Wittenham. At Bow Bridge you turn west, passing Appleford before returning to Sutton Courtenay. The Abingdon Circular Walk passes through the village. You could pick this up to continue your walking in the area. In the worthy nearby town you can visit the historic Abingdon Abbey which dates back to the 7th century.",
