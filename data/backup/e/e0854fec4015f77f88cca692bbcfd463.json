  "description": "This country park in Colchester includes woodland, open spaces, ponds, a lake and wildflower meadows. The park contains a number of well maintained, waymarked trails suitable for cycling and walking. There are very good facilities including a visitor centre where you can find details of all the walking and cycling trails in the park. Look out for wildlife including deer and various woodland birds. High Woods is conveniently located just a mile north of Colchester town centre. You can extend your walking in the town by trying our Colchester Walk. This visits the fascinating castle park with its many historic features. You can also enjoy riverside paths along the River Colne, just to the south of High Woods. About a mile to the east you will find the pretty Ardleigh Reservoir where there's some nice paths along the northern side of the lake.",
