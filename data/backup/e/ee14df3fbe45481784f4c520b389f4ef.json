  "description": "Enjoy a woodland walk to the spectacular Aysgarth Falls in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. There are three tiers to the falls which make for a wonderful spectacle, particularly in wet weather. The upper and middle falls were featured in the film 'Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves'. This circular walk starts on the northern side of the River Ure by the Aysgarth Falls National Park Centre where there is a good sized car park. The centre is a great place to find information about the walks in Aysgarth and Carperby. There is also a cafe for refreshments. You can see it by clicking on the street view link below. After leaving the car park you can pick up a woodland trail through St Joseph's Wood and out into the countryside, where there are great views of the surrounding area. The walk then descends to the river where there are nice viewpoints near the falls. The area is a nature reserve so look out for some lovely flora and fauna on your walk. In the spring and summer you can see wildlflowers and bluebells in the woods. Also look out for wild birds, squirrels and deer. You can return to the car park or extend your walk by crossing the Yore Bridge and following another footpath on the southern side of the river. You'll pass the old Yore Mill and Craft Shop which has some nice gifts. To continue your walking in the area you can head 1.5 miles south and visit the delightful West Burton Falls. The Cauldron Falls (as they are otherwise known) are located very near to the picturesque village and are well worth a visit. The Herriot Way long distance footpath also starts in the village. The circular route takes you through areas of the Yorkshire Dales associated with the vet and author James Herriot. Also nearby is the village of Castle Bolton where you can visit the 14th century Bolton Castle. Head east along the river on our Wensleydale Walk and you can visit Redmire Force and the vilage of Wensley, which gives its name to the dale of Wensleydale.",
