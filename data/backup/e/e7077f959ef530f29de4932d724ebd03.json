  "description": "Climb to the highest mountain in Ireland on this challenging walk in the Wicklow Mountains. The route starts from the Baravore Car Park in a remote part of the Glenmalure Valley. From here you can pick up the footpaths heading north west along the Avonberg River. The route then turns west, heading up to Fraughan Rock Glen and Cannow Mountain. You then turn south to climb to the 925-metre (3,035 ft) summit of Lugnaquilla. From here you can enjoy fine views to the east across the Irish Sea to the hills of the Llyn Peninsula and mountains of Snowdonia in Wales, and west to the mountains of Munster. You descend to Cloghernagh before turning north to Art's Lough. The final section descends through woodland to return to the river and the car park. To continue your walking in the area head north east to Glendalough Lakes. Here you will find waymarked trails, taking you around both lakes with riverside sections, woodland and a waterfall to enjoy as well."
