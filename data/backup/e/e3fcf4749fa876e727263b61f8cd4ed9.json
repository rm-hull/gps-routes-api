  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around the village of Great Missenden in the Chilterns. The walk visits the pretty abbey gardens before climbing the surrounding hills for great views back down to the village and into the surrounding Chilterns countryside. The walk starts in the village near to the train station and parking area. You then head south along a section of the South Bucks Way long distance trail. This will take you to Missenden Abbey where you can explore the pretty Abbey Park with its lake and views of the River Misbourne. The walk then heads east into the hills surrounding the village. You'll pass Chalkdell Wood Nature Reserve before climbing towards Hyde End where there is some woodland and attractive farmland. The route then turns north through South Heath and Ballinger Common. You descend to Frith Hill before returning to the village. The walk links with the Chiltern Link near Ballinger Common so you could pick up this long distance trail to extend your walk. Heading east will take you through the countryside to Chesham where you can enjoy nice riverside walk along the River Chess. Another good option is to follow the South Bucks Way north and link with the Icknield Way Path. You can then enjoy a climb to Coombe Hill for more great views over the area. Also near Coombe Hill are miles of woodland trails in Wendover Woods and waterside walks along the Grand Union Canal. The Chiltern Heritage Trail also passes through the village. The long distance circular trail visits numerous delightful hamlets, villages and towns in Buckinghamshire.",

There's a charming old interior with low beamed ceilings and cosy corners. They serve good quality food and have a nice garden area as well. You can find the pub on the High Street at a postcode of HP16 0AU for your sat navs. They are also dog friendly."

      "content": "Head south east along the South Bucks Way and you could visit the sister village of Little Missenden. Here you can visit the picturesque Shardeloes Park. There's some nice trails around a pretty lake with bluebell woods to see in the adjacent Mop End. Just to the west is the neighbouring village of Prestwood where there are some nice trails around the Prestwood Nature Reserve. The village also includes an historic 17th century pub which is well worth a look. For more walking ideas in the area see the Chilterns Walks and the Buckinghamshire Walks pages."
