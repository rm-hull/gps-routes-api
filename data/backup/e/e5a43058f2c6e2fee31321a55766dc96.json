  "description": "This East Sussex based town is in a great location for coastal and riverside walks. The town is located at the mouth of the River Ouse in between Brighton and Seaford. In the town you can also catch the ferry to Dieppe in France. This walk takes you north along the Sussex Ouse Valley Way to visit the neighbouring villages of Piddinghoe and Rodmell. The walk starts at Newhaven Fort on the coast. The fort dates from the 19th century and includes a parking area and the adjacent Castle Hill Nature Reserve. There are some fine coastal views to enjoy from this elevated spot. The walk then heads north through the town passing Newhaven Marina and Denton Island. You can then pick up the Sussex Ouse Valley Way and follow the waymarked footpath north along the River Ouse to Piddinghoe where you will pass the picturesque Piddinghoe Pond and the 12th century church of St John. You continue north to Southease where you leave the river and head into Rodmell. Here you can pay a visit to the National Trust's Monk's House. The 16th-century weatherboarded cottage was once the home of author Virginia Woolfe and her husband, the political activist, journalist and editor Leonard Woolf. Here they received many visitors from the famous Bloomsbury Group, including T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, and Roger Fry. You can extend the walk by picking up the Iford Circular Walk at Rodmell. The village is well worth exploring with 18 listed buildings, a 12th century church and a sundial marking the Greenwich meridian which runs through the village. You can also pick up the South Downs Way National Trail in this area.",
