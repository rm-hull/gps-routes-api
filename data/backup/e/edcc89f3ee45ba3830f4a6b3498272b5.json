  "description": "Explore the Ancient Royal Forest of Bernwood on this circular walk devised to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Bernwood Forest includes a mixture of woodland, pasture, meadow, heathland and picturesque villages. The walk is often started at Brill and heads to Boarstall, Buckingham, Waddesdon, Nether Winchendon, Quainton and Thame. Highlights on the path include the National Trust owned Boarstall Tower. The attraction includes a 14th-century moated gatehouse and beautiful gardens. Near Oxford you will pass through Bernwood Forest itself. This peaceful area of woodland has a nice butterfly trail where you can look out for 40 different species of butterfly. Also of interest is Nether Winchendon House. This medieval Manor House is situated in a beautiful valley at the foot of the Chilterns and includes a 12th century Great Hall and a 16th century Dining Room. The walk also passes the beautiful Waddesdon Manor. Built in the style of a French chateau between 1874 and 1889 for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild the house is also surrounded by formal gardens and an English landscape park (see video below). There are also waterside sections along the Rivers Thame and Great Ouse through Buckingham. The walk is waymarked with a yellow arrow.",
