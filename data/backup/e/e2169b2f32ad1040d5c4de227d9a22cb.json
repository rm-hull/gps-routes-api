This photo is looking towards the easternmost of the low hills where the Devil is reputed to have jumped from hill to hill. A grassy hillside here leads up to the heathery Jump."

  "description": "This wonderful arboretum in Surrey is filled with 600 amazing sculptures. There's 2 miles of good, woodland footpaths to follow through the 10 acre site. There's also a water garden with sculptures in the lakes and a pretty stream. The pieces are all for sale so the exhibition is always changing. You can easily spend a couple of hours strolling round the site. If you'd like to extend your walk then you could head north to the nearby Frensham Ponds Country Park where you will find woodland and waterside trails around the two large ponds. The circular Tilford Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the pond. The attractive settlement is well worth a visit with a pretty village green, cricket pitch and two medieaval stone bridges over the River Wey which runs through the settlement. There's also a fine local pub dating to 1705 with interesting historical photos and memorabilia to see inside.",

It was designed and built by C Marden in 1868 and at one time was former Prime Minister Lloyd George's local. There is also a Victorian letter box in pub wall. You can find them on Jumps Road at postcode GU10 2LD."
