  "description": "This walk visits Clashnessie Falls and Clashnessie Bay in the Assynt area of Sutherland, on the north west coast of Scotland. The walk starts from a roadside parking area north east of the falls. You can then head west and then south east towards the Clais an Eas burn to reach the falls. The 15m high falls are an impressive sight after rain. The walk also passes the lovely Clashnessie Bay where there's a small sandy beach with a mild microclimate, due to the closeness of the Atlantic Ocean Gulf Stream. To continue your walking in the area you could head north west to visit The Old Man of Stoer, a spectacular sea stack with whale and dolphin spotting opportunites.",

The splendid Knockan Crag Nature Reserve is well worth a visit. The site includes some spectacular limestone scenery with a variety of interesting plant species. There are also some lovely views of the adjacent Lochan an Ais to enjoy here."
