  "description": "An enjoyable climb to Harter Fell in the Eskdale area of the Western Lake District. You can start the walk from the car park at Birks Bridge, just over a mile to the east of the fell. From here you head west, crossing the River Duddon before a woodland section through Dunerdale Forest. Follow the trails through the woods to Birks, Buck Crag, Mart Crag and Maiden Castle. Soon after you will come to the 649m summit of Harter Fell. Here you will find three rocky\u00a0tors and wonderful views of the Duddon estuary, Morecambe Bay, the\u00a0Irish Sea\u00a0and\u00a0the Isle of Man. Several fells are also in sight including\u00a0Sca Fell,\u00a0Scafell Pike,\u00a0Broad Crag,\u00a0Great End,\u00a0Esk Pike,\u00a0Bow Fell\u00a0and\u00a0Crinkle Crags. To extend the walk you could continue north from the summit towards Demming Crag and Hardknott Pass which shares the title of steepest road in\u00a0England along\u00a0with Rosedale Chimney Bank in\u00a0North Yorkshire. Here you can visit Hardknott Castle Roman Fort. From the Birks car park you can head east and pick up trails to take you to Seathwaite Tarn where there's some good paths to follow around the water. There's also nice waterside trails along the River Duddon which you can pick up from the same car park. A few miles to the east you can enjoy a challenging climb to the Old Man of Coniston for more great views. Our circular walk to Dow Crag and Seathwaite Tarn starts from the nearby village of Seathwaite. It's a lovely walk with fine views of the\u00a0Scafells,\u00a0Skiddaw, the Helvellyn range and two beautiful tarns that lie below the peak.",
