  "description": "Follow the Solent Way along the beautiful south coast from Milford on Sea to Emsworth . The route starts off at Milford on Sea and heads along the coastal marshes to Lymington with splendid views of the Isle of Wight. This section runs through the beautiful Keyhaven Marshes where you can look out for a wide variety of birdlife. You also have the option of heading along the long shingle spit to Hurst Castle , one of Henry VIII's Device Forts. At Lymington the route heads inland through the New Forest towards Hythe passing the excellent Beaulieu Motor Museum , the pretty Dibden Inclosure and the Beaulieu River as you go. At Hythe you cross Southampton water on the Hythe Ferry taking you to Southampton where you follow the coast to Gosport and Lee on Solent . On this section you will pass the delightful riverside villages of Hamble-le Rice and Warsash , catching a ferry over the River Hamble between the two settlements. Near here there's also Alver Valley Country Park and the delightful Titchfield Haven nature reserve at Fareham . Here you will find 369 acres of River, fen, pools, reedbed and meadow with a variety of wildlife to look out for. From Gosport a ferry ride takes you over the River Hamble to Portsmouth with its fascinating maritime history. Highlights here include the D-Day Museum where you can see the Overlord Embroidery. This tells the story of D-Day and the Battle of Normandy in 34 extraordinary hand-stitched panels with a total length of 83 metres. The final stretch leads you around the attractive Langstone Harbour to the finish at Emsworth Quay. This is a fantastic walk with much to enjoy including beaches, promenades and marshes with an abundance of interesting wildlife. There is also a strong historical aspect with forts, museums and ships to explore particularly around Portsmouth.",
