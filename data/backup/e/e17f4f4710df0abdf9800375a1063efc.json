The Beer Walk involves walking around the villages of Saddleworth taking in the wonderful local scenery (and a certain amount of local refreshment.) This is traditionally done in Fancy Dress and is a thoroughly enjoyable day for all concerned - participants and spectators alike. Now that the BeerWalk has reached its 35th Year, it is firmly established as one of the area's premier events. This year over 1800 people took part with thousands more turning out to line the route and watch them with upwards of \u00a350,000 being raised for various charities on this event alone."
