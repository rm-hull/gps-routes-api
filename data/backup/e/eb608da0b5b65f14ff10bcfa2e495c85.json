The exposed location seems barely habitable, but the views over the Conwy Morfa are tremendous, and he would be close to his flock."

  "description": "This walk visits the historic Deganwy Castle in the town of Deganwy, Conwy. The town is a lovely place for a walk with a south facing beach, contemporary marina and attractive quay. There's also\u00a0lots of wildlife to see in the adjacent Conwy Estuary and an excellent viewpoint from the ruined castle on this walk. You can start the walk from the town's train station and then follow footpaths a short distance up to the site. Here you will find the atmospheric castle ruins perched at a height of 110\u00a0m (361\u00a0ft)\u00a0above the town. The original fortress dates from the early middle ages and was later rebuilt in stone for King\u00a0Henry III during the 13th century. The castle was subsequently\u00a0destroyed\u00a0by\u00a0Llywelyn ap Gruffudd,\u00a0Prince of Wales\u00a0in 1263. From the site there are splendid views down to the mouth of the River Conwy from the elevated spot. You can then follow a circular footpath around the hill before returning to the train station. Here you could extend the walk by picking up the North Wales Path and following it north along the beach at Traeth Melyn to the North Wales Golf Club.",
