  "description": "This smaller fell is located in the north western area of the Lake District near Bassenthwaite Lake. It's a worthy climb providing great views of the more substantional surrounding fells. The walk starts from the roadside parking at Binsey Lodge just to the east of the hill. From here you can pick up a footpath heading west up to the 447 m (1,467 ft) summit. The hill's isolated position gives great views of the Northern fells of the National Park. You can also see the coast of the Solway Firth while Snaefell on the Isle of Man is also visible on a clear day. Binsey is notable as the northernmost of the Wainwrights. To continue your walking in the area head to Bassenthwaite Lake and enjoy a stroll along the shoreline. You can also enjoy woodland trails in the adjacent Dodd Wood .",

It's a nice spot and only about half a mile from the start of the walk. There's even a public car park there so you could start your walk from there if you prefer. The Cumbria Way also passes the tarn. This waymarked trail provides a good opportunity for exploring the northern fells further."
