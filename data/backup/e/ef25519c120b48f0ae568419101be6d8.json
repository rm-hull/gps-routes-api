    "description": "Enjoy walking and cycling trails in this large area of woodland near Ludlow. The woods are located on the border of Shropshire and Herefordshire and include a number of signed trails taking you to the highlights of the forest. The walk starts at the ruined castle in Ludlow and follows the Mortimer Trail over the River Teme into the forest. You'll pass Whitcliffe Common on the southern side of the river where there's a nice viewpoint and riverside trails. The trail heads into the centre of the woods where you can enjoy a climb to High Vinnalls . It's a challenging ascent with the hill reaching a height of about 1200ft. This walk uses a section of the long distance Mortimer Trail which runs through the heart of the forest. You can extend your walk by following the trail south and visiting the Croft Ambrey Iron Age Hillfort where there are great views to the Welsh Hills. There's also nice trails through the parkland and gardens of Croft Castle . The Shropshire Way also passes Ludlow so you could pick up this trail and head deep into the Shropshire countryside.",
