  "description": "Ben Lawers is one of the most popular climbs in Scotland due to the beauty of the surrounding area. It is also designated as a National Nature Reserve and run by the National Trust for Scotland. The walk starts at the Ben Lawers car park and follows a nature trail through woodland with wild flowers and views of the Edramucky Burn. The path continues towards Beinn Ghlas with wonderful views of Loch Tay and other munros such as Meall Corranaic and Meall nan Tarmachan. The path then reaches the 1,214 m (3,983 ft) Ben Lawers summit with magnificent views of Ben Lomond and Glencoe to the west, and the Cairngorms to the north. It is a steep climb to the summit but on a good path for most of the way. The reserve is populated with many interesting arctic-alpine flora including purple saxifrage, moss campion, yellow saxifrage, globeflower and rose root. Also look out for a variety of wildlife including whinchat, stonechat, willow warblers, ring ouzels, red grouse, ptarmigan and red deer. The Rob Roy Way runs past the nearby Loch Tay and Killin. This is a good option if you would like to continue your walking in the area.",
