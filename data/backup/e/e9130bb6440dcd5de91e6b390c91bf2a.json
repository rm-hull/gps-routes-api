  "description": "This East Devon village boasts a number of historic properties, a pretty village green, an historic watermill, a 15th century church, a 16th century pub and some fine country footpaths. This circular walk from the village visits two of the highlights of the area at Killerton Park and Ashclyst Forest. The walk starts in the village where you could pay a visit to the National Trust's Clyston Mill. The mill sits in a fine location on the River Clyst and details the history of milling in the area. In the village you can pick up the Two Counties Way and follow the waymarked trail north to Killerton Park. The expansive estate is run by the National Trust and surrounds a fine 18th century mansion. There's miles of footpaths with stunning gardens, peaceful woodland and beautiful parkland to see here. On the northern end of the estate you will find the Ellerhayes Bridge and the River Culm Walk. There's another small car park here next to the photogenic 15th century bridge. You can park here and enjoy a stroll along the River Culm with more lovely views to enjoy. The route then heads east to Budlake before following country lanes to the expansive Ashclyst Forest. The forest is another great place for walking and cycling with several waymarked paths and lots of wildlife to look out for. After exploring the forest you follow country lanes south west to return to Broadclyst.",
