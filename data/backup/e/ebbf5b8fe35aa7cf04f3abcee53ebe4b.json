The nearby pit which provided the chalk (now the Humber Bridge Country Park) became flooded every winter and was eventually abandoned in 1960."

  "description": "This Country Park and Local Nature Reserve consists of woods, meadows, ponds and cliffs. From the park there are dramatic views over the River Humber and the iconic Humber Bridge in East Riding of Yorkshire. There are three lovely nature trails waymarked with hand carved owls, rabbits and frogs. You can also follow The Phoenix Sculpture Trail which winds its way through the woods and features 10 unique sculptures. If you are on your bike please cycle carefully on the designated paths. If you would like to extend your cycle or walk then you can follow the Trans Pennine Trail west along the River Humber to North Ferriby. Our Hessle Foreshore Walk will take you in the other direction along the pretty banks of the river to Hull. A walking and cycling trail will also take you across the bridge to Barton-on-Humber. You can pick this up from the country park on our Humber Bridge Walk. On the other side of the river you'll find Barton Upon Humber's lovely Waterside Nature Reserve which is a great place for looking out for the riverside birds.",

The working mill includes an interesting museum and a fine restaurant with a landscaped garden. Head east into Hull and you can explore the docks and visit The Deep, a huge aquarium with over 3500 fish."
