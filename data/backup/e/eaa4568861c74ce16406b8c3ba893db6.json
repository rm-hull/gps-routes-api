  "description": "This walk visits a splendid viewpoint in the Scottish Borders, near Melrose. The scenic spot was a favourite of Sir Walter Scott, author of novels such as Ivanhoe and Rob Roy. You can start your walk from the roadside parking on the B6356 a few miles east of Melrose. Then follow a footpath up to the viewpoint where there's a geographical view indicator showing the landmarks you can see from the lookout. The walk can be extended by heading east to climb the nearby Bemersyde Hill where there's more wonderful views over the surrounding hills and countryside. Highlights from here include the River Tweed, Melrose town and the Eildon Hills. To continue your walking in the area try the Melrose Walk and visit the photogenic ruins of the historic 12th century Melrose Abbey. You can also pick up the long distance Borders Abbeys Way in this area.",
