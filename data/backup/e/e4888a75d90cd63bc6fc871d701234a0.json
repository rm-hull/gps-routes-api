This view can be seen at the beginning of the Agatha Christie's Marple (TV series) episode \"Endless Night\" (2013).  The church in view is the noteowrthy St Bartholomew's. The nave and tower are 12th century with the saddleback roof added to the tower in the 18th or early 19th century. The roof is notable as being one of only two such designs in England.  The chancel was added in the 13th century."

The pretty village has been used as a filming location for many tv dramas including Midsomer Murders, Lewis, Marple, Foyle's War and the 2008 Christmas special of Jonathan Creek. It was also used in the Dawn French sitcom The Vicar of Dibley. In the series, the church of St Mary the Virgin was renamed \"St Barnabus\". The village church is well worth some investigation as it dates back to the 12th century with the nave being the oldest surviving part."

This shows one of the footpaths through the park. The country estate is owned by the BBC and though it is not open to the public the trail skirts the eastern edge with views towards the privately owned 18th century mansion. Among Crowsley Park's former owners were the Baskerville family who provided the inspiration for Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles. Since the Second World War, Crowsley Park has been the site of a signals-receiving station used by BBC Monitoring. In 2018, the BBC began a further modernisation of the facility, including the installation of 18 new satellite dishes."
