    "description": "This circular walk from Burnsall takes you to the village of Appletreewick and the wonderful viewpoint at Simon's Seat. On the way there's nice views of the River Wharfe and Blands Beck. The walk starts on the five arched Burnsall Bridge where you can pick up the waymarked Dales Way and follow it along the River Wharfe to Howgill. Here you follow the How Beck for a short while before turning north to climb to Simon's Seat. The summit stands at a height of 485m (1590ft) offering fabulous views over the surrounding countryside of the Yorkshire Dales. After taking in the views you descend to Dalehead Farm and High Skyreholme where you pick up country lanes to take you to Appletreewick. There's some pretty cottages here and a noteworthy, historic pub in the shape of the Craven Arms. Soon after leaving Appletreewick you pick up the riverside path again and follow it back into Burnsall.",
