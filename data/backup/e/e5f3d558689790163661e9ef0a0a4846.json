  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Lochindorb near Grantown on Spey in the Highlands of Scotland. The loch has a good walking and cycling path running along its eastern side. From here you can enjoy views across the water to the ruins of Lochindorb Castle which sits on an island in the centre of the loch. The loch is also a popular spot for birdwatchers with black-throated divers, ospreys and greylag geese to look out for on the walk. There is a parking area on the eastern side of the water where you can start your walk. Near here there is also an area of conifer woodland. To the east you can pick up the long distance Dava Way. The shared cycling and walking route runs along a dismantled railway line from Forres in Moray to Grantown On Spey .",
