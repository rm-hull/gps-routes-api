There are trails for walkers, cyclists and for the disabled. Leicester relied on wells and springs for drinking water, like most large cities and towns, until the 19th century when the cholera epidemics in 1831,1832 and 1847 forced Parliament into action. In 1847, an Act of Parliament allowed a private company to be formed to supply the city. By 1854, it had already built Thornton reservoir, together with a treatment plant and distribution mains. Cropston Reservoir was added in 1866, and Swithland Reservoir in 1896."

  "description": "This Leicestershire based town is close to a number of peaceful woodland areas and an excellent viewpoint at the high point in the county. This circular walk around Coalville visits some of the highlights of the area including Donington le Heath Manor House, Sence Valley Forest Park, Grange Woods, Bagworth Heath Woods, Thornton Reservoir and the highest point in Leicestershire at Bardon Hill. The walk starts at Donington le Heath Manor House on the south western side of the town. The historic 17th century house is one of the highlights of the area and includes a beautiful garden. The fully furnished house was owned by a family who lived in the shadow of the Gunpowder Plot. From the house the route then follows public footpaths south west to visit the Sence Valley Forest Park where there's a series of lakes and some pleasant woodland trails. You could take a slight detour from the route here to visit the adjacent Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Wood which was planted in 2012 to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. It's another pleasant area with woodland trails and a lake in the centre. The route continues south east through Ibstock where you'll pass through Grange Wood and Battram Wood where there's a signed cycle route. You continue south east towards Bagworth where you'll pass Royal Tigers and Centenary Wood before coming to Bagworth Heath Woods where there are good wildlife spotting opportunites. In the Bagworth area you pick up sections of the Ivanhoe Way and the Leicestershire Round and follow the waymarked paths east to the pretty Thornton Reservoir. Here you turn north through Browns Wood and Stanton Under Barton before climbing to the viewpoints at Billa Barra Hill and Bardon Hill, the highest point in the county. There's a radio mast, an old quarry and fine views to the Malvern Hills, the Shropshire Hills and the Peak District from the hill top. After descending the hill you head south west through Greenhill and Hugglescote to return to Coalville town centre.",
