      "caption": "Craig Goch dam and reservoir, Elan Valley, Wales taken 1965. The dam at Craig Goch, the highest upstream of the series of dams in the Elan Valley, is often referred to as the 'top dam'. It is located at a height of 1040 feet (317m) above sea level. As with all the dams, work started with the arrival of the railway line at the site. In the case of the top dam the line had farthest to go and a rocky outcrop had to be blasted and dug through on the route to the site. Work on excavating the foundations for a secure base for the structure started in July 1897, some three years after the start of work on the lowest dam at Caban Coch. Craig Goch is seen by many as the most attractive of the dams, with an elegantly curved retaining wall and a series of arches carrying a narrow roadway across the top of the dam. It has a domed valve tower and the structure is typical of the 'Birmingham Baroque' style of much of the waterworks scheme."

  "description": "This waterside cycling and walking route takes you through the beautiful Elan Valley in Powys. The traffic free cycle path runs along the Caban-coch, Garreg-ddu and Pen-y-garreg reservoirs. It's a very beautiful area with the series of lakes surrounded by lush countryside, attractive woodland, wildflower meadows, streams, waterfalls and the Welsh hills and mountains. Along the way there is the option of climbing high above the Elan Valley on a variety of footpaths. From here you can enjoy stunning views over the reservoirs. Also of note are the spectacular dams including the Garreg-ddu dam which has the appearance of a viaduct and the Caban Coch dam which resembles a magnificent waterfall. The route starts from the Elan Valley car park near to the Caban Coch dam. Here there is an excellent visitor centre with a cafe, toilets and a wealth of information on the area. You then follow the good, surfaced path along the reservoirs finishing at the dam at Pen-y-Garreg Reservoir. The cycle route can be extended to a challenging 64 mile route as shown on the video below. You can virtually follow the route by clicking on the google street view link below! The route can be extended by heading to the bearby Claerwen Reservoir which has a nice cycle and walking trail along the northern side of the water.",
