  "description": "Enjoy a short cycle or walk around this pretty lake in Milton Keynes . The lake has a well surfaced path around it's perimeter making it ideal for families looking for a safe cycle path or walkers looking for an easy waterside stroll. You can start the walk from the car park on Watling Street on the eastern side of the lake. About a mile south west of the lake you will find Howe Park Wood where there's some nice shady woodland trails and the 16th century St Giles Church in Tattenhoe.",
