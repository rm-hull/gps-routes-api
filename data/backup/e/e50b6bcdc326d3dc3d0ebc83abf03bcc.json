The engine house and chimney for the beam pumping and winding engine that worked in the shaft are a scheduled monument, but the lack of care and maintenance means that the engine house in particular is now in a very poor state."

  "description": "This pretty little village is located in a peaceful spot in the Upper Towy valley in Carmarthenshire. It's a lovely quiet place for a walk with scenic views and a fine old pub to relax in afterwards. This circular walk from the village visits the River Towy (Afon Tyfi) before heading to the old Nantymwyn Lead mine. Here you'll find some photogenic old remains of this significant mine which are a scheduled ancient monument. You'll then explore the peaceful woodland area at Nant Gwyn to the east of the village. The final section links up with the river where there's some lovely views down the Towy Valley from the bridge on the western side of the settlement.",
