At this level, the usual line through the furthest arch is bouncy, but the middle arch is usually easiest and the near arch perfectly possible, so paddlers have plenty of choices. In low levels, the middle arch is very shallow but unthreatening, whilst the furthest arch has most of the water, but is made awkward by big rocks. The gauge on Grinton Bridge (a ways upstream from here, where paddlers put in) was at three feet."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Richmond to the National Trust's Hudswell Woods, just to the west of the town. The walk starts on Richmond Bridge which you cross to the southern side of the river Swale. From here you follow footpaths west along the River to Round Howe Wood and Billy Bank Wood before coming to Hudswell Woods. The area is particularly lovely in spring with lots of bluebells to see. There's also good bird watching opportunities with Kingfishers by the river and Sand Martins in the woods. Also keep your eyes peeled for owls, deer and rabbits as you make your way through the woods. There's also a car park at the site if you prefer not to walk from the town. The route continues west to Lownethwaite\u00a0where you'll find an impressive four arched bridge. You can then turn around and head east back to the town on alternative paths just to the south of the woods.",
