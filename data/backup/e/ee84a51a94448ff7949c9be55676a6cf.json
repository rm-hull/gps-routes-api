      "caption": "River Swale at Lownethwaite. Overnight rain had brought the Swale up considerably during the day making life difficult for some canoeists. At this level, the usual line through the furthest arch is bouncy, but the middle arch is usually easiest and the near arch perfectly possible, so paddlers have plenty of choices. In low levels, the middle arch is very shallow but unthreatening, whilst the furthest arch has most of the water, but is made awkward by big rocks. The gauge on Grinton Bridge (a ways upstream from here, where paddlers put in) was at three feet."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Richmond to the National Trust's Hudswell Woods, just to the west of the town. The walk starts on Richmond Bridge which you cross to the southern side of the river Swale. From here you follow footpaths west along the River to Round Howe Wood and Billy Bank Wood before coming to Hudswell Woods. The area is particularly lovely in spring with lots of bluebells to see. There's also good bird watching opportunities with Kingfishers by the river and Sand Martins in the woods. Also keep your eyes peeled for owls, deer and rabbits as you make your way through the woods. There's also a car park at the site if you prefer not to walk from the town. The route continues west to Lownethwaite where you'll find an impressive four arched bridge. You can then turn around and head east back to the town on alternative paths just to the south of the woods.",

      "content": "The Richmond to Marske Circular Walk is a more challenging walk from the town. It will take you up to the viewpoint at Whitcliff Scar before visiting the pretty village of Marske. There are excellent views over the Swaledale countryside from this route. Two of the highlights of the National Park are located nearby in the shape of Aysgarth Falls and Castle Bolton. The circular Gilling West Walk starts from the nearby village. It passes the Georgian Aske Hall which lies just to the north of the town. Gilling West is well worth a visit with a number of historic listed buildings to see including an 11th century church.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Richmond Walks and Yorkshire Dales Walks pages."
