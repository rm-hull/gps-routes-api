It was opened for divine service on the 6 January 1876, and it was consecrated as a private chapel on the 13th October 1883. The Architect was John Gibson, responsible for much of the work on the estate of Plas Power. The building remains a private chapel. The exterior is rock faced rubble in Cefn sandstone with freestone dressings, and leaded roof. In 2009 the roof is now zinc, not lead."

  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Clywedog Trail from Nant Mill to Bersham near Wrexham. It's a lovely area with a country park, woodland trails, a riverside path along the Afon Clywedog and a pretty waterfall to see. You can start the walk at the visitor centre and car park at Nant Mill. From here you can pick up the waymarked footpath heading east to the waterfall and then to Bersham Bridge. On the way you'll pass through Plas Power Woods where you can look out for a variety of woodland birds. You can extend your outing by heading north into the village of Coedpoeth or south to the Ty Mawr Reservoir. Erddig Hall and Country Park is located just to the east of Bersham and well worth a visit.",
