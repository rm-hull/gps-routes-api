The inn was demolished in 1961 ready for the raising of the water level by four feet. The battle for planning permission for raising the level raged for twenty years until 1981 when Michael Heseltine finally refused consent. Thus the inn was unfortunately demolished unnecessarily, leaving just the jetty."

  "description": "Follow the lovely lakeside path around Ennerdale water on this circular walk in the Lake District National Park. Ennerdale is ideal for a tranquil walk because of its remote location.  It is also the only lake not to have a road running alongside it so is the perfect escape. The well defined path runs close to the shoreline for most of the route with some woodland sections along the way. The views of Ennerdale valley are fabulous with some of the highest and best-known fells in Cumbria forming a spectacular backdrop -  Great Gable, Green Gable, Brandreth, High Crag, Steeple and Pillar are all visible as you make your way around the lake. The walk begins in the car park at the western end of the lake near Ennerdale Bridge where you can get refreshments in the Shepherd's Arms pub. There's also a car park at Bowness Knot on the northern end of the lake. If you would like to continue your walk you could head into the adjacent Ennerdale Forest and enjoy a woodland hike along the River Liza. A few miles to the north you will find Cogra Moss. This delightful little reservoir is a very peaceful spot with nice woodland trails to follow through the surrounding plantations.",
