As well as Roman sites, Ashtead Common boasts prehistoric earthworks, mediaeval boundary systems and a C17th brick-lined spring."

There are miles of quiet cycling and walking paths taking you to woodland, scrub grassland, a meadow, ponds and streams. There are also two ancient Scheduled Monuments - a Roman villa and a triangular earthwork. The route below begins and ends at the conveniently located Ashtead Railway Station at the southern end of the common. The adjacent Epsom Common is a great option if you would like to continue your outing. Horton Country Park is nearby while the Thames Down Link also runs past the site.",
