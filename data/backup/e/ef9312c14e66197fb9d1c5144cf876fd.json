Although not easy to see it here, the spot in this photo was at one time the centre of a Roman tile making complex which included a villa (here), a bathhouse and numerous clay pits, the various earthworks and ditches of which can still be clearly seen amongst the trees. As well as Roman sites, Ashtead Common boasts prehistoric earthworks, mediaeval boundary systems and a C17th brick-lined spring."

  "description": "This 500 acre ancient wooded common is also a National Nature Reserve. There are miles of quiet cycling and walking paths taking you to woodland, scrub grassland, a meadow, ponds and streams. There are also two ancient Scheduled Monuments - a Roman villa and a triangular earthwork. The route below begins and ends at the conveniently located Ashtead Railway Station at the southern end of the common. The adjacent Epsom Common is a great option if you would like to continue your outing. Horton Country Park is nearby while the Thames Down Link also runs past the site.",
