  "description": "This Lancashire market town has some nice local river and coastal walks to try. It's also close to the Forest of Bowland AONB where there are numerous walking trails to try. This walk from the town takes you along the Wyre Way to the nearby Wyre Estuary Country Park. The walk starts near the train station which is easily reachable from Blackpool or Preston. Head east to Little Poulton and then north and you can pick up the Wyre Way near Skippool. Follow the waymarked footpath north and it will take you past Thornton to the Wyre Estuary Country Park. The park has good facilities with a visitor centre and bird hide where you can look out for a variety of birds on the water.",
