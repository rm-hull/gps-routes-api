  "description": "This walk takes you from the town of Amesbury to the world famous Stonehenge. It's about a 2 mile walk from the town to the site, using a series of public footpaths and tracks. The walk starts by heading through the underpass of the A303 roundabout, north of the town centre. It's a short walk along the A345 to the footpaths heading west into the countryside around Halfmoon Clump. You'll pass the Old King Barrows before heading along The Avenue to Stonehenge. The walk can be extended by visiting the Stonehenge Cursus. The large Neolithic cursus monument was constructed several hundred years before the earliest phase of Stonehenge in 3000 BC. To explore the Stonehenge site itself you will need to purchase a ticket from English Heritage. The area around the cursus is on open access land so can be visited for free. The route also passes close to Durrington Walls. The 4500 year site includes the largest complete henge in Great Britain. To really stretch your legs you can pick up the long distance Salisbury Country Way which runs through the area.",

      "content": "There's lots of good options in nearby Amesbury and Durrington for refreshments but we'd recommend a trip down to the nearby village of Upper Woodford. Here you'll find the splendid Bridge Inn. The main attraction here is the lovely, large riverside garden area where you can relax and enjoy refreshments in an idyllic setting. Indoors there's a nice light country-style decor with sofas. They also have a very good menu and drinks selection. You can find the inn a couple of miles south of Stonehenge, in Upper Woodford, right next to the River Avon. Postcode for your sat navs is SP4 6NU."
