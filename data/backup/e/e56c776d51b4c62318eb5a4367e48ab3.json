  "description": "This splendid waterside walk follows the River Ouse from its source near Lower Beeding to the coast at Seaford Bay. The walk starts near Horsham at the village of Lower Beeding and passes through Slaugham, Handcross and Staplefield. Near here you will pass the impressive Ouse Valley Viaduct, one of the most photographed sites on the path. The route continues through Lindfield, Freshfield, Sheffield Park, Newick, Barcombe Mills, Hamsey, Lewes, Rodmell, Southease, Piddinghoe and Newhaven before finishing at Seaford Bay. Walk highlights include the beautiful Nymans Gardens at Handcross. Owned by the National Trust it includes the ruins of a Gothic Mansion surrounded by delightful gardens, a lake and woodland. The walk also passes Sheffield Park Station which now plays host to a shop, model railway, museum and the Bessemer Arms pub. Located at Fletching on the banks of the Ouse it is a must see for railway enthusiasts. For wildlife lovers the delightful Offham Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest will be a major attraction. Its biological interest comes from its habitat of alluvial marshland, which supports large numbers of amphibians. The walk also passes near the interesting county town of Lewes, while the final section along the seafront at Seaford is also particularly lovely.",

You can find the pub at Anchor Lane, Barcombe with a postcode of BN8 5EA for your sat navs. In Newhaven there's The Hope Inn which is located in a lovely spot next to the harbour. You can enjoy a meal with some fine views of the boats coming into the harbour which is located at the mouth of the River Ouse.
