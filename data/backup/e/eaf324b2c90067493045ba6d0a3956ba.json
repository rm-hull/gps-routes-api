  "description": "This easy walk visits the pretty Redesmere Lake and the adjacent Capesthorne Hall around Siddington in Cheshire. The lake is a pleasant place for a stroll with woodland trails and lots of wildfowl to look out for on the water. The walk starts from the parking area at the southern end of the lake. From here you can pick up a public footpath heading north along the eastern side of the water. You'll pass Fanshawe before coming to Capesthorne Hall. The 18th century hall is surrounded by attractive parkland and gardens which you can explore for a fee. This route sticks to the free public paths, retracing its steps back to the Redesmere car park. The walk runs for a distance of about 3 miles.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in this scenic area head to Holmes Chapel where you can join with the waymarked Dane Valley Way and enjoy a riverside walk to Brereton Heath Local Nature Reserve near Swettenham. The fascinating Jodrell Bank Arboretum is also nearby. Just to the east there's Sutton Reservoir and Danes Moss Nature Reserve to explore. The reservoir is another nice place for a waterside stroll while the reserve has some pleasant boardwalks taking you over lowland raised bog. It's an interesting area with some rare flora and fauna to see. In this same area there's also the worthy village of Gawsworth. The village includes three noteworthy historic buildings including the 15th century Gawsworth Hall. The house and grounds of the historic Tudor house are well worth exploring. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
