  "description": "This Nottinghamshire based village has some nice riverside trails along the River Greet and River Trent. The settlement is located close to both Southwell and Newark River . It includes a train station and the Southwell racecourse. This figure of eight loop walk from the village visits the neighbouring settlements of Upton and Fiskerton . On the way there's nice waterside sections along the River Greet and River Trent. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Trent Valley Way and follow the waymarked footpath north to Upton, passing the Southwell Racecourse on the way. The route then heads through the village before turning south to Upton Mill and the River Greet. Follow the river south east and it will take you back to Rolleston. Here you can pick up the Trent Valley Way again and follow it south to the River Trent. The trail will take you west to Fiskerton. After exploring Fiskerton you can follow a country footpath east back to the village.",
