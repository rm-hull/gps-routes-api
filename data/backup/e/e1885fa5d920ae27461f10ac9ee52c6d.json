  "description": "This walk climbs to Dunkery Beacon on Dunkery Hill, the highest point in\u00a0Exmoor\u00a0and Somerset. From the 1,703 feet (519\u00a0metre) summit there are fabulous views over Exmoor, the\u00a0Brecon Beacons,\u00a0Bodmin Moor,\u00a0Dartmoor, the\u00a0Severn Bridges\u00a0and the\u00a0Bristol and English Channels. The walk starts at the Dunkery Hill car park taking you up the hill to the beacon before heading into the delightful Dunkery and Horner Wood National Nature Reserve. The reserve covers 4000 acres/1604 hectares and is owned and managed by the National Trust. It consists of upland heath and woodland with a variety of wildlife including\u00a0pied flycatcher, wood warbler, lesser spotted woodpecker, redstart and dipper. It also supports 14 of the 16 UK bat species, including barbastelle and Bechstein bats. You should also see several Exmoor Ponies and Exmoor's Iconic Red Deer. At the hill summit there's a handy toposcope where you can see all of the landmarks that are visible. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Selworthy Beacon in the Holnicote Estate . Here you can enjoy more fabulous views of the Exmoor coast. The long distance Coleridge Way also passes close to the hill. You could pick this up and head north to the coast and visit Porlock and Porlock Weir .",
