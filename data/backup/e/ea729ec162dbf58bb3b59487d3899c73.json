    "description": "Ham Wall Nature Reserve is part of the Avalon Marshes in the beautiful Somerset Levels. There are several easy walking trails in the reserve. The Ham Wall walk runs along the Glastonbury Canal on a nice grassy path from the car park on Ashcott Road. From here you pick up the trail and head east along the water. Look out for lots of wildlife including otters, dragonflies, butterflies, marsh harriers, water voles, bitterns and roe deer. Ham Wall consists of a variety of habitats including reedbeds, wetland, grassland and woodland. There's four short walking trails in all. They are nicely laid out and include a number of bird hides and seating areas dotted along the way. Just to the west of the reserve you will find Shapwick Heath Nature Reserve which has more great trails to try. The reserve is located just a few miles west of Glastonbury. You could visit by bike by following National Cycle Route 3 from Glastonbury. If you'd like to extend your walking in the area you could climb to the famous Glastonbury Tor. The tor is actually visible in the distance from the reserve and makes a worthy extension to your outing. Just to the north there's Westhay Moor another of the reserves on the marshes.",

Just to the south of Street you'll also find the neighbouring village of Compton Dundon where you can try the Compton Dundon and Combe Hill Wood Walk. The circular walk includes a climb to Iron Age Hillfort on Dundon Beacon and a visit to the Hood Monument, which is something of a historic local landmark. For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks page."
