    "description": "Enjoy walk along the River Lea on this popular waterside walk in Hertfordshire. The route runs from Hertford to Ware and then onto Stanstead St Margaret's, using a section of the waymarked Lea Valley Walk . The walk runs for a distance of about 5 miles so it's perfect for an afternoon stroll. At the end of the route you can catch the train back to Hertford from St Margaret's. Start the walk from Hertford Castle next to the river in the town centre. The main castle entrance was built by Edward IV in 1463-5 and since extended by sections built in the late 1700's and as recently as 1936/7. They are now offices of the the Town Council. From here you can pick up the waymarked riverside footpaths, heading east to Hertford Lock, the first lock on the River Lee Navigation. You continue past Ware Lock and the adjacent Ware Weir, before coming into the town of Ware itself. From Ware you continue south east, passing Hardmead Lock and the Amwell Nature Reserve , a 37 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The site is a former gravel pit, which has been restored to become a wetland nature reserve with two lakes, Great Hardmead Lake and Hollycross Lake. You could take a small detour from the route here to explore the reserve and look out for the various wildfowl which visit the site. The final section takes you past Stanstead Lock which incorporates a rare example of a swing-bridge. Soon after you come into St Margarets where you can catch the train back to Hertford. You could also return on foot using the New River Path . This follows the New River which runs parallel to the Lea and would turn it into a circular walk. To extend the walk continue south along river path to Hoddesdon where you can visit the Rye Meads RSPB Nature Reserve and the Clayton Hill Lake in Lower Nazeing.",
