  "description": "This walk explores the grounds of the National Trust's Arlington Court on the edge of Exmoor in north Devon. The early 19th century house is surrounded by a substantial estate with 20 miles of footpaths. Highlights include the picturesque lake, a series of steel sculptures, and a beautiful Victorian Garden. There's also a Carriage Museum where you can see forty historic vehicles, ranging from elegant coaches used for state occasions to humble carts used to carry servants. You can continue your waterside walking by heading a couple of miles east to explore Wistlandpound Reservoir. There's a lovely circular trail with good wildlife spotting opportunities to be found here.",
