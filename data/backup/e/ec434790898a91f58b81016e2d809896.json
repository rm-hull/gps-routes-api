    "description": "This lovely, largely off road cycle route runs from Okehampton to Lydford Gorge through the Dartmoor National Park . It runs for about 11 miles along a disused railway path and forms part of National Cycle Network Number 27 but is suitable for both cyclists and walkers. The route begins in Okehampton and takes you towards Meldon where you will pass the impressive Meldon Viaduct and a delightful bluebell wood. The viaduct was opened in 1874 and carried the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) across the West Okement River. It was constructed from wrought iron and cast iron and is now a Scheduled Monument. There's great views over the Okement Valley and Dartmoor from the elevated position of the bridge. The route continues onto the pretty village of Sourton before passing Lake Viaduct where the scenery is particularly lovely. The final section then takes you to the village of Lydford where you will pass the noteworthy castle and church. You then come to the finish point at the impressive Lydford Gorge with its dramatic scenery which includes waterfalls and and a series of whirlpools known as the 'Devil's Cauldron'.",
