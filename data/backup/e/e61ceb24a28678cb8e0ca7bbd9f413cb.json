The sign on the gate explains that there is a permissive footpath across the field (seen as a worn route headed for the trees over the brow of the hill), although the post standing in the field says 'No public access'. The public right of way hugs the edge of the field, requiring you to do a U-turn in the pointed eastern corner of the field. One of the medieval hollow ways can be seen going from middle right to top left of the picture."

In March 2009 a new temporary route for horse riders and cyclists was opened between Old Winchester Hill and Beacon Hill. This new route replaces the old temporary route that ran though Warnford. The South Downs Way website says \"The route has been changed to improve the safety of users until agreement can be reached on a permanent route across the valley ... The old route is still usable but is not recommended and is not signed as the South Downs Way.\" The temporary route is likely to be in place until March 2011. This view is the upper part of a permissive stretch approaching the trig point on Beacon Hill, just beyond the wooden gate."

There was a gap in the trail across the Meon valley, and following various complications (involving public enquiries) there are split routes for footpath users and bridleway users at this point. The additional footpath waymarker indicates that this is the footpath route."
