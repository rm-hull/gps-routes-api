  "description": "Enjoy a short waterside walk along this pretty reservoir in Whaley Bridge. Toddbrook was built in 1831 to supply water for the Peak Forest Canal which you can pick up at Whaley Bridge Basin. You can easily reach the reservoir from the train station/centre of the town. There is a nice footpath running along the reservoir with views of the surrounding woodland, countryside and Peak District hills. Look out for birds including herons and ducks on the water. If you would like to extend your walk then the Midshires Way runs past the reservoir so you could pick this up and head south through the Goyt Valley to the nearby Errwood and Fernilee Reservoirs. You can also explore the Errwood Estate with its old ruined hall and peaceful woodland with azaleas and rhododendrons. Another good option is the climb Eccles Pike for far reaching views over the Peak District. This walk also starts from Whaley Bridge. Also in the town you can pick up the Peak Forest Canal and head east to the restored Bugsworth Basin or north toward North Mills.",
