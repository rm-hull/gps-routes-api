  "description": "This circular walk explores the area surrounding Oxwich Bay on the Gower Peninsula. The Travel Magazine named Oxwich beach the most beautiful in Britain. You start at the car park in Oxwich and head along the coast through Oxwich Wood before continuing to Oxwich point where there are splendid coastal views. On the way you will pass the fascinating St Illtud's Church. Founded in the 6th century the church has an interesting stone font and tranquil grounds. From Oxwich point you continue around the southern part of the headland with views over Port-Eynon Bay. Footpaths through the countryside then take you back to Oxwich via the fine ruins of Oxwich Castle. The route then heads through the lovely sand dunes of Oxwich Burrows Nature Reserve where you can look out for a variety of flora and fauna. These include more than 600 species of plants such as Bee Orchids and Early Marsh-orchids. The area also includes a freshwater lake, salt marsh and the pretty stream of Nicholaston Pill. Look out for birds including Cetti's Warblers, Sedge Warblers and Bittern. If you'd like to continue your exercise then you could try the Three Cliffs Bay Walk which visits Nicholaston Burrows and Penmaen Burrows. The video below shows a walk from Oxwich to Three Cliffs also. The atmospheric ruins of the 12th century Pennard Castle are near here and well worth a visit too.",
