The large park is internationally important for its collection of ancient trees, with over 300 veteran oak, beech, ash, hornbeam and sweet chestnut, some of which are thought to be 800 years old. There are also areas of chalk grassland that fill with spectacular displays of orchids and other wild flowers in spring and summer. The visitor centre on site offers excellent facilities including a caf\u00e9, toilets and shop. It has a comprehensive range of information about the park's landscape, wildlife and heritage. For those wishing to venture into the wider countryside, an excellent guide is available for a 6.5 mile circular walk from the visitor centre, passing through the nearby village of Shoreham. At Lullingstone a fully equipped education centre enables groups of all ages, from primary schools to adult art and conservation groups, to learn about all aspects of the countryside."

  "description": "Explore 460 acres of parkland in this large open space in the Darenth Valley of Kent. Located between Eynsford and Shoreham, Lullingstone contains several waymarked walking trails of varying lengths. The park is well known for its large collection of ancient trees including oaks, beeches, hornbeams, ash and sweet chestnut, some of which are around 500 years old. Also of interest is the 15th Century Lullingstone Castle, Tom Hart Dyke's World of Garden Plants and Lullingstone Roman Villa with its spectacular mosaics and Roman wall paintings. If you wish to continue your walk then the Darent Valley Path runs through the park along the River Darent. You can pick up the trail on the eastern side of the park near the castle. Following it south will take you to Shoreham, Otford and Sevenoaks. Head north and you will come to Horton Kirby and Dartford. Our Eynsford Circular Walk visits Eynsford Castle ruins before taking you through the park and along the river. It's another good option for exploring the area around the park.",
