  "description": "The coastal Cornish village of Porthcothan lies between Newquay and Padstow in the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There's much to enjoy with a picturesque cove, a lovely sandy beach, some splendid rock formations and lush grassy dunes. This walk from the village takes you south to the wonderful Bedruthan Steps and the neighbouring village of Mawgan Porth. You can start your walk from the public car park in Porthcothan where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it south to Porth Mear, Pentire Cove and the Bedruthan Steps. Here you'll find an impressive series of rock formations and a secluded beach. There's also great views towards Carnewas Island and Trescore Islands from the cliff top path. You continue south to reach the village of Magwan Porth where there's another beautiful beach with rock pools and caves to explore.",
