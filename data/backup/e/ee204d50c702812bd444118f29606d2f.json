  "description": "This Lancashire based village is located in the Ribble Valley near to a noteworthy educational institution and some lovely countryside. This circular walk from the village visits Stonyhurst College before picking up a riverside trail along the River Ribble. The walk starts in the village and follows public footpaths north through the grounds of the historic college which dates back to the 16th century and is Grade I listed. Notable alumni\u00a0of the college include Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of\u00a0Sherlock Holmes. J. R. R. Tolkien also has strong associations with the area and wrote part of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy in the college. Much of this route follows the Tolkien Trail visiting several locations thought to have inspired the books. To the north of the college you can pick up a riverside path along the River Hodder near Over Hacking Wood. This will lead you south to the old Lower Hodder Bridge where you can take a detour to visit the pretty village of Great Mitton where you could stop at the splendid Mitton Hall Hotel or the Aspinall Arms for a break. You then retrace your steps and head past Winckley Hall to the point where the Hodder joins with the Ribble. Here you can pick up the Ribble Way and follow it south and then west along the river. At Merrick's Wood you turn north to follow a track back into Hurst Green.",
