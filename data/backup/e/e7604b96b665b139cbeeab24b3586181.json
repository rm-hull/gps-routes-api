  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Hillend Reservoir in Caldercruix, North Lanarkshire. You can start your walk from the car park at the Caldercruix Countryside and Nature Park at the western end of the water, near to the dam. Here you can pick up a section of the Airdrie to Bathgate Cycle Path which runs along the southern side of the water along a disused railway line. There's lovely views across the tranquil lake and good trout fishing as well. The lake is great for wildlife spotting too with heron, coot, moorhen, great crested grebe, osprey, oystercatcher, northern lapwing, curlew, kingfisher and white-throated dipper to look out for. You may also see roe deer in the woods and otters in the river area.",

There's some fine trails in Polkemmet Country Park, Palacerigg Country Park, Fannyside Lochs and Drumpellier Country Park where you can enjoy a walk along the Monkland Canal. To the west there's more good lochside walking around Hogganfield Loch on the outskirts of Glasgow. Forrestburn Reservoir is located just to the south east near Armadale. To the south there's Forrestburn Reservoir and Roughrigg Reservoir where there's a circular walk along the grassy paths of the old railway track."
