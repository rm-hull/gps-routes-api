  "description": "This walk visits the historic castle on Piel Island in Morecambe Bay, Cumbria. Piel is one of The Islands of Furness, situated to the south-west and east of the Furness Peninsula. You can catch the Piel Ferry to the island from Roa Island which is located just to the south east of Barrow in Furness . There are also boat trips to see the colony of birds and seals which haul out onto the shingle beach. You can walk to the island at low tide from Walney Island but local guidance is required before attempting this. On the island you can follow footpaths around the photogenic ruins of Piel Castle . The English Heritage owned castle dates from the 14th century. It was built by the Abbot of Furness to guard Barrow-in-Furness against pirates and Scots raiders. The large keep, inner and outer baileys and the towered curtain walls are still standing. The island includes a pebble beach where you can look over to the seal colony on Walney Island to the west. Also look out for birds including Eider duck, Cormorants, Herring Gull, Blackheaded Gulls, and when the tide is out waders and shore birds such as Curlew, Green Shank, Red Shank, Plover, Shell Duck and Lapwing. There's also great views of the huge windfarms in the Irish Sea, several Lake District fells and Blackpool Tower on a clear day.",
