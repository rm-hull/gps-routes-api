  "description": "This village in south Cumbria is located just a few miles east of the famous Lake Windermere in the Lake District. You're also close to Morecambe Bay where you can enjoy waterside walks in Grange-over-Sands and Cartmel. This circular walk from the village visits Yewbarrow and the Whitbarrow National Nature Reserve. There's some splendid limestone scenery and excellent views from the high points on the walk. The walk starts in the village next to the old church. From here you can follow footpaths up to Yewbarrow where there are some fine views to the surrounding fells. You continue up to Whitbarrow and the Lord's Seat, another fine viewpoint. The route then loops through the nature reserve before turning west through Mill Side to return to the village.",
