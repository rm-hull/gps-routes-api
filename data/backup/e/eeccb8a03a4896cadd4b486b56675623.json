Tin mined upriver was brought here to be shipped off, but in the 1500s the mining, somewhat ironically, caused the River Fowey to silt up meaning that ships could no longer reach the town. The settlement is now a pleasant little market town with little to remind us of its former importance. There's a museum located in the former Corn Exchange where you can learn all about the mining past of this interesting town."

  "description": "This Cornish town has a number of interesting local historical sites to visit on foot. There's also waterside trails along the River Fowey, a nearby hill to climb and two nature reserves with good walking trails and lots of wildlife to see. The town is also known as the antiques capital of the county with several pretty shops selling furniture, collectibles, ceramics and other historical pieces. This circular walk from the town visits some of the highlights of the area including the viewpoint at Helman Tor, the National Trust's wonderful Lanhydrock Estate and the ruins of the historic Restormel Castle. The walk starts on the western side of the town, close to the train station. From here you follow country lanes south west past Rosehill to No Man's Land where you can pick up the Saints Way. Follow the waymarked trail west past Powderham Castle to Lanlivery where you turn north to climb towards Helman Tor. There's interesting rock formations and great views across the countryside from the elevated position of the tor. This area also includes the Breney Common Nature Reserve and the Red Moor Nature Reserve where there are great wildlife spotting opportunities. After taking in the views the route descends to Trebell Green and Fenton Pits where you pick up country lanes heading east towards Tredinnickpits and Maudlin. From here it is a short walk north to visit Lanhydrock. The park has miles of woodland and parkland trails which are suitable for cyclists and walkers. After exploring the park you pick up trails heading south east towards the River Fowey and Restormel Castle. The English Heritage run castle is now a photogenic ruin set in beautiful Cornish countryside. It was built in the 13th century and used as a retreat for its medieval owners and was twice visited by Edward, the Black Prince. From the castle you continue south along the river to return to Lostwithiel.",
