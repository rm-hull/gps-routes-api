    "description": "This Welsh village is located in a wonderful spot on the Gower Peninsula. There's excellent trails to follow through the surrounding dune system with hill climbs and great sea views to enjoy as well. This circular walk from the village visits the Llangennith Burrows and the interesting rock formations near Burry Holmes island on the coast. The walk starts in the village and follows footpath west past the Llangennith Moors to the coast, passing the lovely sand dunes at Hillend Burrows and the National Trust's splendid viewpoint on Rhossili Down on the way. You then turn north passing through more splendid dunes in Llangennith Burrows to reach the Spaniard Rocks where there are views to Burry Holmes Island. You can walk out to this pretty island at low tide. The route then heads north to Bluepool Corner and Broughton Burrows with lovely views down to Broughton Bay. Near Delvid Burrows you turn south east to head to Brynymoor and then return to the village.",
