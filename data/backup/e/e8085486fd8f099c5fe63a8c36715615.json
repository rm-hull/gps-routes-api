It is named after J Meade Falkner\u2019s novel 'Moonfleet', a classic tale of smuggling, treasure, and shipwreck set in 18th-century England. Falkner uses the local geography of Dorset and the Isle of Wight in the book, only changing some of the place names. The village of Moonfleet is based on East Fleet in Dorset by Chesil Beach. Dorset's Corfe Castle and Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight are also key plot locations."
