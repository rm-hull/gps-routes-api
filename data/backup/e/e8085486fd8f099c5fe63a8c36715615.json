It is named after J Meade Falkner\u2019s novel 'Moonfleet', a classic tale of smuggling, treasure, and shipwreck set in 18th-century England. Falkner uses the local geography of Dorset and the Isle of Wight in the book, only changing some of the place names. The village of Moonfleet is based on East Fleet in Dorset by Chesil Beach. Dorset's Corfe Castle and Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight are also key plot locations."

This circular walk from the village takes you to the coast at Chesil Beach. On the route you'll visit Langton Hive Point, Herbury and Gore Cove before heading to the splendidly positioned Moonfleet Manor Hotel.

The historic inn dates back to the 17th century when it was frequented by smugglers and \u201cwreckers\u201d. During the second world war, Barnes Wallis stayed there when the bouncing bomb was being tested on the Fleet; and it was even the secret rendezvous for Russian spies during the Cold War. The interior is full of character and olde worlde charm. If the sun is shining then the lovely garden is very inviting. You can find them at postcode DT3 4HU."
