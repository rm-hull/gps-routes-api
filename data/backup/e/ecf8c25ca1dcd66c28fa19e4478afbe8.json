  "description": "The Box Hill area is a magnet for walkers with miles of heathland, woodland and country trails to try. With views of the Surrey Hills and the North Downs it's a place where you can walk for hours with wonderful scenery. This circular walk visits several highlights of the area including Box Hill Country Park, Norbury Park and Headley Heath. The route runs for about 8 miles with some moderate hill climbs on the way. The walk starts from the National Trust visitor centre and car park at the country park. From here you can pick up the Mole Gap Trail and follow it north east along the River Mole towards Swanworth Farm and Norbury Park. In the park you'll find a Georgian manor house, peaceful woodland trails and chalk grassland with lots of wildflowers and butterflies to see. Look out for wildlife which includes roe deer, badgers, foxes and woodpeckers. The route then turns east following footpaths towards Mickleham Downs where there is a small climb and more woodland trails. You then turn south, passing along the edge of the expansive Headley Heath and the High Ashurst Education Centre. The heathland here is very attractive with yellow gorse, bluebell woods and purple heathers in the warmer months. The trail then leads you through Box Hill village before picking up the Pilgrims Way long distance trail. This will lead you west back to the car park where the route finishes.",
