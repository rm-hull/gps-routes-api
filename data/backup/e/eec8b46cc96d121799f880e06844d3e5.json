  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Loch Insh near Kincraig in the Caingorms. You can start the walk from the parking area at the north eastern end of the loch. Then walk up to Kincraig Bridge where you can enjoy fine views over the loch and the River Spey. On the way you'll pass the picturesque churchyard of Insh Church which sits right next to the loch. Ospreys are known to nest in the trees around the loch so keep your eyes peeled as you make your way along the paths. There's also a watersports centre so you may see people windsurfing on the water.",
