On the left is a by-pass channel, along which the River Dodder flows under normal circumstances. Although it was built in the Dodder valley, the reservoir is not fed by that river \u0096 it is too peaty for the public water supply. Instead it collects water from a number of local streams which don't originate in the mountain peat bogs. However, during heavy rain some of the Dodder flow spills over the weir at Castlekelly and is contained in the reservoir, hopefully preventing flooding further downstream in Dublin."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the Bohernabreena Reservoir in County Dublin. The trail runs for just under 4km around the perimeter lake on a fairly flat path. It's a popular place for a scenic walk, being only about 40 minutes drive from Dublin. On the way there's fabulous views of the deep glacial valley with Kippure mountain making a splendid backdrop near the head of the lake. It's also great for flora and fauna with pretty wildflowers and deer to look out for on the way. You can start off from the Bohernabreena Upper lake car park at the southern end of the water, on the Allagour Road. From here head north west to pick up the Dublin Mountains Way near the lake. You can follow this waymarked, long distance trail north along the eastern side of the water. You can extend the walk by continuing north to visit the lower reservoir.",
