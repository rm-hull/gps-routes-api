The local people were themselves called \"sgadan Abergwaun\" - Fishguard herrings. In fact these were sardines and were for a short period abundant in the Irish Sea but the shoals came to an abrupt end in 1790, a disaster for the local community which had developed as a result of the industry. This sculpture, erected in 2006, is a tribute by a local artist, John Cleal, to the place where he has lived for many years. It has been erected atop a 26tonne Preseli boulder in the old harbour at Lower Town/Y Cwm, the former fishing and trading port of Fishguard."

  "description": "The town of Fishguard is located in a wonderful location on the Pembrokeshire Coast. There's fine coastal walking with two beautiful headlands located either side of the town. This coastal walk takes you east from the town to the popular Dinas Head using a section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path . The walk starts on the front in Fishguard and follows the coastal path east, passing the quay. You continue past the remains of the old fort to Aber Hywel and Dinas Island or Head. You can then follow a circular path around the headland before returning to Fishguard on the same paths. The area is great for flora and fauna with  gorse, bracken, hawthorn, blackthorn, heather, foxglove and orchids to see.  There's also good birdwatching opportunities as you may see choughs, peregrine falcons and various other sea birds.",
