The local people were themselves called \"sgadan Abergwaun\" - Fishguard herrings. In fact these were sardines and were for a short period abundant in the Irish Sea but the shoals came to an abrupt end in 1790, a disaster for the local community which had developed as a result of the industry. This sculpture, erected in 2006, is a tribute by a local artist, John Cleal, to the place where he has lived for many years. It has been erected atop a 26tonne Preseli boulder in the old harbour at Lower Town/Y Cwm, the former fishing and trading port of Fishguard."

  "description": "The town of Fishguard is located in a wonderful location on the Pembrokeshire Coast. There's fine coastal walking with two beautiful headlands located either side of the town. This coastal walk takes you east from the town to the popular Dinas Head using a section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path. The walk starts on the front in Fishguard and follows the coastal path east, passing the quay. You continue past the remains of the old fort to Aber Hywel and Dinas Island or Head. You can then follow a circular path around the headland before returning to Fishguard on the same paths. The area is great for flora and fauna with gorse, bracken, hawthorn, blackthorn, heather, foxglove and orchids to see. There's also good birdwatching opportunities as you may see choughs, peregrine falcons and various other sea birds.",

The inn also has an interesting history as in 1797, the French unsuccessfully attempted an invasion on the west coast of Wales only to be thwarted by the locals, this was the last invasion attempt on Britain. A peace treaty was signed between the British and French in the bar area. You can find the pub on Market Square, Main St with a postcode of SA65 9HA for your sat navs."

      "content": "Head south east of the town and you can visit the Gwaun Valley. There's some nice riverside footpaths and woodland trails in this attractive area. If you were to head west along the coast path it will take you to Strumble Head. The beautiful headland is a great place for wildlife watching with porpoises and seals regular visitors to the seas below. There's also the Strumble Head Lighthouse and a stunning coastline with views towards Dinas Head and Cardigan Bay. The headland also includes the climb to the viewpoint at Garn Fawr. Just east of Dinas Head is the delightful town of Newport. The picturesque settlement is well worth visiting with its sandy beach, excellent variety of shops and cafes, and some fine trails along the River Nevern Estuary. For cyclists National Cycle Route 47 starts/ends in the town. It runs east through the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park to Swansea and Newport."
