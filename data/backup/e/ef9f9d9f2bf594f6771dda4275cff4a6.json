  "description": "This walk visits Lower and Upper Upnor on the River Medway near Rochester in Kent. The area includes English Heritage's Upnor Castle, a 16th century fortification with an interesting history. The walk starts from the public car park at Lower Upnor and follows a section of the Saxon Shore Way south to the castle and Upper Upnor. The Elizabethan artillery fort was begun in 1559 and redeveloped in 1599-1601, to protect warships moored at Chatham dockyards. There's lovely views across the river from the grounds here. You can also take a stroll along the quaint old high street into the village after exploring the castle.",
