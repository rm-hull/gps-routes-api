  "description": "Enjoy fabulous views of the Pennine hills at this country park near Halifax. There is a super waterside path around the 34 acre reservoir while there are other paths leading into the surrounding moors. It's a very picturesque place with nice views across the water to the surrounding woodland and moors. To extend your walking you can pick up a bridleway from the reservoir and head west to Warley Moor Reservoir . It's another very peaceful spot with nice views and sailboats on the water. Our Halifax Walk follows a section of the Hebble Brook which starts from reservoir and travels through Halifax before emptying into the River Calder at Salterhebble.",
