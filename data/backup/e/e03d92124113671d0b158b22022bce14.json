  "description": "This walk explores the beautiful Kylemore Abbey Estate in\u00a0Connemara,\u00a0County Galway. The estate includes lakeside trails, stunning Victorian Walled gardens, peaceful woodland paths and views of the surrounding\u00a0Twelve Bens Mountains. It's a special place and one of the major highlights of the area. This walk follows a nice surfaced path running along Kylemore Lough towards the Gothic church on the northern side of the water. It's an easy trail with some attractive woodland and fine views over the lake. The impressive looking church was built in honour of the Mitchell's wife who passed away in Cairo. It can can seat about 50 people and has one stained glass. The centrepiece of the estate is the magnificent 19th century abbey. The photogenic building was built in the neo-gothic architectural style and has been likened to a farytale castle. To continue your walking in the area head north east to visit the stunning Killary Fjord . There's some wonderful scenery here with the fjord flanked by the mountains of\u00a0Mweelrea\u00a0and\u00a0Ben Gorm.",
