There's a network of paths taking you around woodland and wildflower meadows with fine views of the River Bradshaw Valley. The following is taken from an information board at the site.\n\u201cOusel is the old English word for the Blackbird, although it is possible that its cousin the Ring Ousel may have nested close to Bradshaw Brook in the past.\n\nGrazing or mowing has not taken place at the site for several years allowing young Oak and Birch trees to start regenerating. This has been helped along by the planting of 4000 young native broadleaves by Bolton Metro and local interest groups during the winter of 1996-7.\u201d"

  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around Jumbles Reservoir in this pretty country park in Bolton . The park is set within the beautiful West Pennine Moors with a lovely waterside footpath around the reservoir. There are also good facilities with a visitor centre and cafe. The park is located just a couple of miles north east of Bolton city centre, near to the Lancashire village of Chapeltown.  If you have time you could continue your walk along the Witton Weavers Way to the nearby Wayoh Reservoir and Nature Reserve. Just south of the reservoir there's also Ousel Nest Meadows to explore. There's some pleasant trails with river and countryside views here.",
