It then passes Bromley Cross and Bradshaw on its way to meet the River Tonge at Leverhulme Park east of Bolton."

There's a network of paths taking you around woodland and wildflower meadows with fine views of the River Bradshaw Valley. The following is taken from an information board at the site. \u201cOusel is the old English word for the Blackbird, although it is possible that its cousin the Ring Ousel may have nested close to Bradshaw Brook in the past. Grazing or mowing has not taken place at the site for several years allowing young Oak and Birch trees to start regenerating. This has been helped along by the planting of 4000 young native broadleaves by Bolton Metro and local interest groups during the winter of 1996-7.\u201d"
