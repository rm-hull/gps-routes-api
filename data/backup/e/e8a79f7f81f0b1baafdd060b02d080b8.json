  "description": "This North Yorkshire based village is located near Keighley and Skipton in the Craven District of the county. This walk from the village takes you up to Wainman's Pinnacle and Lund's Tower, a folly and viewpoint located just south west of the settlement. You can start the walk in the village at Sutton Park, a delightful local park with green lawns and flower beds. From near here you can pick up footpaths heading south west through the countryside to the tower. The monument was built by James Lund, the the son of William Lund, the owner a large textile manufacturing business. It is thought to have been constructed either to celebrate the birth of Lund's daughter Ethel or to commemorate the 1887 jubilee of Queen Victoria. The route then continues to Wainman's Pinnacle which lies just to the west of Lund's tower. The monument stands on Earl Crag at a height of 354 metres. The two neighbouring towers are often referred to as the Salt and Pepper Pots.",
