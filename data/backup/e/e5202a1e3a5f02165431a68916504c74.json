  "description": "Travel through the setting of Sir Walter Scott's 19th century novel on this circular walk around Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire. The path starts Ashby-de-la-Zouch and first heads to Moira where you will follow the Ashby Canal for a short stretch. The route continues passing Shackerstone, Coalville and Staunton Harold. Highlights on the path include the Ashby Canal, Cliff Hill Quarry and Staunton Harold Reservoir. Also look out for the National Trust owned Calke Abbey Park near the Staunton Harold Reservoir. This Grade I listed country house is slightly off the route but well worth a visit.",
