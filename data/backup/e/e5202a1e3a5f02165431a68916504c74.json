  "description": "Travel through the setting of Sir Walter Scott's 19th century novel on this circular walk around Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire. The path starts Ashby-de-la-Zouch and first heads to Moira where you will follow the Ashby Canal for a short stretch. The route continues passing Shackerstone , Coalville and Staunton Harold. Highlights on the path include the Ashby Canal , Cliff Hill Quarry and Staunton Harold Reservoir . Also look out for the National Trust owned Calke Abbey Park near the Staunton Harold Reservoir. This Grade I listed country house is slightly off the route but well worth a visit.",
