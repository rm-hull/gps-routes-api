It is amazing that as much has survived has did in 1989 when I last saw it. It's well hidden in a wooded area and we started looking at dusk and found it in full darkness with the aid of torches. Amazingly, our party escaped from the woods unscathed."

  "description": "Explore 700 acres of wooded hillsides, steep gorges, meadows and wet valley floor in this country park near Swansea and Gowerton. The park is great for walking and cycling with the trackbed of the old London Midland Scottish Railway forming the park's main footpath and cycleway. There are a number of water features in the park with the Clyne River, streams, old footbridges and a number of lakes and ponds to enjoy. Look out for birdlife that includes wagtails, wrens, nuthatches, robins and woodpeckers. If you would like to continue your walk/cycle you can follow the traffic free Swansea bike path along the coast into Swansea, or north to Gowerton. The nearby Singleton Park with its beautiful botanical gardens is also well worth visiting.",

      "content": "There's some good mountain bike trails in the park with downhill sections and jumps to try. See the video below for more details. A few miles east of the park there's a fine climb to Kilvey Hill to try as well. There's some peaceful woodland trails and excellent views over Swansea city and docks from this prominent viewpoint. You can also pick up the Swansea Canal and enjoy a cycle or walk along the towpath to Pontardawe. The Swansea Bike Path passes the eastern edge of the park. The shared cycling and walking route runs along a surfaced path from Mumbles Head to Swansea, with splendid views of Swansea Bay and its beaches."
