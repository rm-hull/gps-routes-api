  "description": "A walk along the Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Leigh, where you can finish the walk with a visit to Pennington Flash Country Park. The walk starts at the canal basin near to the south western end of Worsley Woods. Around here you can see the 18th century Worsley Packet House which sits next to the canal in a picturesque location. The route runs for about 8 miles, passing Boothstown, Astley Green and Bedford before coming into Leigh. Along the way you'll see lots of little bridges, old mills and barges making their way along the canal. You finish at Pennington Flash where there's a 170 acre lake and a number of bird hides. You can extend the walk by continuing west along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to the Wigan Flashes Nature Reserve. At the start of the route there's nice trails to follow around Worsley Woods. There's also streams, a lake, sculptures and a wild flower trail to enjoy.",

The pub overlooks the Worsley Delph, an historic site which became the start of the first industrial canal in the country. Here there are 46 miles of tunnels that lead to a network of underground mines. The Delph has recently been restored and made into a local heritage attraction. The pub here has a good food and drinks menu including a fine Sunday Roast. You can find them at Worsley Rd, M28 2NL."
