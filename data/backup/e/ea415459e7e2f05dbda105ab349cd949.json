When the canal from Wendover to Tring was being built in 1797 water was taken from the streams flowing towards Aylesbury and to compensate the water millers this reservoir was built to ensure a year round flow of water to the mills. In 1814 the demand for water on the canal was such that a pumping engine was installed and this was used for about 25 years. By this time the canal company had brought up the milling rights and since then the reservoir has no longer been used to supply water to the canal or water mills. For this reason the water level is now permanently kept at a low level compared with the height of the earth dam."

The reservoir is a site of special scientific interest. Prestwood & District Angling Club manage the fishing."

  "description": "This walk visits the Weston Turville Reservoir just south of the Buckinghamshire village of the same name. You can follow pleasant footpaths round the water for a distance of just over a mile. It's a lovely spot with easy flat trails and fine views across the still waters of the lake to the surrounding Chiltern Hills. The site is also home to Aylesbury Sailing Club so you can often see sailboats and dinghies on the water. The reservoir has an interesting history stretching back to 1797 when it was built as a feeder for the Wendover Canal Arm of the Grand Union Canal. You can easily extend your walk by picking up the canal towpath to the east of the lake. There are also bird hides around the site where you can look out for various wildfowl including the shoveler duck.",
