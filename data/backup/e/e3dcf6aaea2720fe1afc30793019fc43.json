  "description": "Enjoy riverside trails, rolling Wiltshire countryside and views of Stonehenge on this circular walk through the beautiful Woodford Valley. The walk starts in the town of Amesbury in the parking area next to the River Avon. Cross the river and then follow the riverside path to Moor Hatches and Normanton where you cross over on the footbridge. At Normanton head south toward Wilsford Manor before picking up a footpath to Springbottom Farm. Just to the north of here you can visit the Normanton Barrows and the iconic Stonehenge . Tracks then take you to Lake Bottom, Durnford Mill and Great Durnford. Here you can visit the interesting Norman Church, admire the delightful thatched cottages and enjoy refreshments at the Black Horse pub. The converted mill is also very picturesque with its riverside location and weeping willows. After passing through Great Dunford the walk continues north through Ham Wood before returning to Amesbury. To continue your walking in the area you can try the Amesbury to Stonehenge Walk or pick up the long distance Salisbury Country Way which runs through the town.",
