  "description": "This walk visits the Source of the River Severn from Hafren Forest along a section of the Severn Way. The source can be found high on Plynlimon , in the uplands of Mid-Wales, on the western boundaries of the forest. The walk start from the Hafren Forest car park where you can pick up the Severn Way. Follow the waymarked trail north west along the infant River Severn or Afon Hafren. The path gradually climbs through the forest, passing the Rhaeadr Blaenhafren (waterfall) before coming out on the slopes of Plynlimon. A short climb from the edge of the forest will then take you up to the source of the river. Here you'll find a marker post which lies at an elevation 620m or 2034ft. There's also fine views of the Cambrian Mountains and the mountains of Snowdonia from this elevated viewpoint. It's just over a 3 mile walk from the car park so about 6.5 miles there and back. You can turn it into a longer circular walk by following different trails back through the forest if you have time.",

You can follow the Glyndwr's Way along part of the lake where there is an impressive dam and lots of wildlife to look out for. Just to the west you could pick up the Cambrian Way and follow it south to visit the Source of the River Wye. It's about a 2.5 mile walk to reach the site."
