The circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the area including Beeston Castle, the Shropshire Union Canal and the Sandstone Trail. Head a couple of miles north of the park and you could pick up the popular Whitegate Way. The shared cycling and walking trail follows a disused railway line north from Winsford to Cuddington. A car park and the old station can be found at the Winsford end. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
