  "description": "The Icknield Way Path starts at Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire and heads to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk along prehistoric pathways. There's fantastic views as you climb through the hills of the Chilterns AONB. There's also a series of lovely nature reserves and country parks to enjoy on the way. Highlights on the walk include the Cam Valley views from Royston Heath , the lovely Dunstable Downs Country Park and the splendid Whipsnade Tree Cathedral . The trail is mostly a walking trail but there are cycling opportunities as well. For example through Thetford Forest there are plenty of good off road trails to try. This is located near the Suffolk end of the path and is another route highlight.",
