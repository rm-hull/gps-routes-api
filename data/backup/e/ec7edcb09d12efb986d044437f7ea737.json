Although close to the A94 road it cannot be seen from it. Access is however simple by parking in Laggantygown cemetery car park and following a path 100 yards through the trees. From the boathouse one can follow a network of tracks through the forest some 2 miles to Boat of Garten but beware, do take a map & compass, the forest is vast and featureless."

Crannogs were artificial islands dating from perhaps 1st century AD onward and built to house people and provide some protection from wild animals and predatory man!"

  "description": "This walk visits Loch Vaa near Boat of Garten and Aviemore in the Cairngorms. You can start the walk from the parking area at the south western corner of the loch, just off the A95 and next to the Laggantygown Cemetery. From here you can pick up footpaths heading east along the southern part of the loch. The loch is very photogenic with beautiful clear waters and views of the surrounding hills. It also contains the remains of a crannog, a historic fortified structure constructed on an artificial island in the middle of the loch.",

Just west of Aviemore there's the wonderful Craigellachie Nature Reserve. The reserve includes a series of lochans, fascinating plantlife and a wonderful viewpoint towards the nearby Cairn Gorm. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
