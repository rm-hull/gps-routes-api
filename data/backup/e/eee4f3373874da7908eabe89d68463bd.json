  "description": "This 880 acre common in Woking is a great place for a peaceful walk. There are miles of woodland walking paths, a number of Bronze Age barrows, wet areas, ponds and protected heathland. Look out for birdlife which includes nightjar, woodlark and Dartford warbler. The common is famous for its sand pits which were used by H.G. Wells as the site of the first Martian landing in his novel The War of the Worlds. To extend your walking in the area you can head to the pretty Goldsworth Park Lake or pick up the Basingstoke Canal .",
