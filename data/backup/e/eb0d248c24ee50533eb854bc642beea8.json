  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Knock Hill near Largs on the North Ayshire coast. The walk starts on the front next to the pier. You then head north to Noddsdale Water where you can pick up a waterside path heading north east past Netherhall. The route continues north to Brisbane Mains before coming to the summit of The Knock which stands at a height of 217 metres. Here you will find an ancient Iron Age Hillfort and splendid views to Cumbraes, Arran , Bute and the Firth of Clyde. The route then descends west along the Blackhouse Burn to the coast where you can pick up the Ayrshire Coastal Path at St Fillan's Bridge. Follow the path south and it will take you back to Largs. To continue your walking in the area try the Largs Walk which climbs to another fine viewpoint on Castle Hill.",
