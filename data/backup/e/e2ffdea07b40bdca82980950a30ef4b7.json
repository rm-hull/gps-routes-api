  "description": "Enjoy a lovely riverside walk along the River Great Ouse in this attractive Norfolk town. The interesting town has a nice market square, a mediaeval parish church and a Victorian clock tower, constructed in 1878. Several rivers and long distance footpaths runs through the area surrounding the town so there are lots of nice waterside walking options. The walk starts from the train station and heads to the river where you pick up the Fen Rivers Way long distance footpath. The waymarked trail heads north along the Great Ouse towards Stowbridge and Watlington. At Wiggenhall St Mary Magdalen you can cross the river on the Magdalen Bridge. Footpaths then return you to Downham Market on the western side of the river. To extend your walking in the area you could continue north along the river into King's Lynn. Just to the east of Wiggenhall St Mary Magdalen you can pick up the Nar Valley Way and enjoy a walk along the River Nar. Following the river south will take you towards Brandon Creek and Littleport. If you follow the river to the Denver Sluice and then turn south west along the New Bedford River you could visit the wonderful Welney WWT. Here you will find more riverside trails, boardwalks and a tremendous variety of birdlife to look out for. In the reserve you can also pick up the Hereward Way long distance trail. The Ouse Valley Way also runs through the town and will take you along the river through Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire and Norfolk. One nice option is to follow the river south from Downham Market to Ely and visit the magnificent cathedral.",
