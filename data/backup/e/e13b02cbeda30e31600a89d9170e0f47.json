Across the Ghyll westwards are Thorn Crag, Loft Crag and finally Pike of Stickle. Below the steep eastern face of Harrison Stickle lie Stickle Tarn and its Ghyll, thus ensuring that all drainage from the fell is to Great Langdale."

  "description": "This popular circular walk takes you to the top of the Langdale Pikes. One of the best known features of Great Langdale they include the Pike of Stickle, Loft Crag, Harrison Stickle and Pavey Ark. Alfred Wainright said of the Langdale Pikes: 'No mountain profile arrests and excites the attention more than that of the Langdale Pikes and no mountain group better illustrates the dramatic appeal of a sudden rising of the vertical from the horizontal; the full height from valley to summit is revealed at a glance in one simple abrupt upsurge to all travellers on the distant shore of Windermere and, more intimately, on the beautiful approach along Great Langdale. Nor is the appeal visual only: that steep ladder to heaven stirs the imagination, and even the emotions, and this is especially so whenever the towering peaks come into view suddenly and unexpectedly..' The walk starts from the New Dungeon Ghyll National Trust car park and follows the spectactular Dungeon Ghyll Force waterfall on a footpath largely consisting of a series of stone steps. Most of the path is quite easy although there are a couple of rockier sections which require a bit of scrambling. When you reach the summit you are rewarded with magnificent views of the surrounding area, with Lake Windermere and Elterwater clearly visible. The walk then takes you around the peaceful Stickle Tarn before passing Pavey Ark and heading west to Harrision Stickle. You continue to Pike of Stickle before descending to Loft Crag and Mark Gate. If you'd like to try another nearby fell you could head to the nearby Bowfell. The route for this starts from very near to the start point for this one.",
