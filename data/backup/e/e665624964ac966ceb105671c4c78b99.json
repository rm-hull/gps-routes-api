  "description": "This little Devon village lies just to the east of Sidmouth. It's home to a good caravan park and a fine tourist attraction in the shape of a lovely donkey sanctuary. This circular walk from the village visits the coast at Dunscombe Cliff before heading to the Donkey Sanctuary to the east of the village. The walk starts in the village and follows a footpath south past Combe Wood Farm to the coast. Here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow the waymarked footpath east along Higher Dunscombe Cliff to Weston Mouth where there is an attractive beach. Here you turn north, passing the Dunscombe Woodland Coppice before coming to the Donkey Sanctuary. At the free attraction you'll find a series of walkways taking you around the site and providing plenty of opportunities to interact with the resident donkeys. There's also a fine restaurant with wonderful views over the surrounding countryside.",
