  "description": "This walk takes you the full length of the Malvern Hills from End Hill in North Malvern to Chase End Hill at the southern end. The Hills divide the counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire and are covered with numerous footpaths and bridleways. The start point for the walk is the car park at North Malvern in the 19th century spa town of Great Malvern. You then pass End Hill, Table Hill and Sugarloaf Hill on your way to Worcestershire Beacon. At 425 m (1,394 ft) the Beacon is the highest point in the Malverns and offers fabulous views of Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, the Cotswolds, the Welsh Mountains and the Severn Valley. You can climb to the beacon from Great Malvern on our circular walk. The route continues to Jubilee Hill, Black Hill and Herefordshire Beacon where you will find the noteworthy British Camp Iron Age hill fort and reservoir of the same name. Next you come to Hangman's Hill, and Swinyard Hill before arriving at the interesting Midsummer Hill where you will find an Iron Age hill fort which spans Midsummer Hill and Hollybush Hill. There are also splendid views of Eastnor Deer Park and the castle grounds. The final section takes you over Raggedstone Hill to the finish point at the end of the range, known as End Hill. It's a delightful walk on good footpaths with fabulous views throughout. Also look out for the springs and fountains dotted along the hills. If you would like to try a longer walk try our Malvern Hills Circular Walk which takes you along a section of the old Worcestershire Way long distance trail.",
