  "description": "This circular walk takes you to Clougha Pike in the Forest of Bowland. The hill is located a few miles east of Lancaster, reaching a height of 413\u00a0m (1,355\u00a0ft). Clougha Pike commands wonderful views over Morecambe Bay , Snowdonia and the Lake District Fells. It's a great area for wildlife too so keep your eyes peeled for grouse and hares on the way. You can park at the Rigg Lane car park (postcode below) just to the west of the hill. You then head towards Ottergear Bridge near Cragg Wood and the River Conder. The path then takes you towards Wisp Hill and Black Fell before coming to the Clougha Pike summit. Take a while to soak in the wonderful views. On a clear day you should be able to see the coast and beyond to the Isle of Man. The route then descends back to the car park via Windy Clough with views of Trough Brook on the way. An alternative, shorter route is to start from Rigg Farm and follow the Rowton Brook to the summit. The walk can be extended by continuing east along the path to Grit Fell and Ward's Stone , the highest hill in the Forest of Bowland. It can be quite a difficult walk though as it is a boggy area. Cyclists can reach the hill on regional route 90 which runs through Quernmore.",
