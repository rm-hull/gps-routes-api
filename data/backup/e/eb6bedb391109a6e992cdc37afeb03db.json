  "description": "This walk takes you around the attractive Holland Park in Kensington, London. The park is located just south of Holland Park tube station and a nice place for a stroll in Central London. There's over 22 hectares of beautiful gardens, wildlife rich woodland, a stunning Japanese garden with waterfalls and a nice cafe for refreshments. The historic park was formerly the grounds of a Jacobean mansion called Holland House. Today only the east wing and some ruins of the ground floor and south facade remain, along with various outbuildings and formal gardens Just a mile to the east are the famous Kensington Gardens where you can enjoy lakeside walking and cycling. You can also pick up the The Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk in this area.",
