  "description": "This walk visits Brock Bottom near Garstang in the Forest of Bowland AONB. The area is something of a local hidden gem with peaceful waterside and woodland trails to enjoy. You can start the walk from the car park at the picnic site on Brock Mill Lane. From here you can pick up a waterside footpath heading south along the River Brock to Brock Bottom. It's a photogenic spot with nice woodland, babbling brooks and the ruins of the old mill building to admire. In the spring months there are also lots of pretty bluebells to see. You could extend the walk by heading north from the car park to see the rushing weir and the Thirlmere Aqueduct.",
