  "description": "This circular walk visits the Barrow Gurney Reservoirs in Somerset. The Barrow Tanks are a nice place for a stroll with wildlife such as Great Crested Grebes, Tufted Ducks and Cormorants to look out for on the water. The site is located just a few miles to the south west of the city of Bristol. You can start the walk from the village of Barrow Gurney and then follow country lanes south to the reservoirs. Continue east and you will come to Barrow Common where you can pick up a section of the Monarch's Way. Follow it north and it will take you to the neighbouring village of Long Ashton with nice views of the surrounding countryside and woodland. You can then follow country lanes and public footpaths back to Barrow Gurney village. To continue your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Ashton Court Park. The 850 acre country estate includes miles of footpaths taking you to woodland, parkland and gardens.",
