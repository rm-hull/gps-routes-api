  "description": "This circular walk around the Derbyshire town of Wirksworth uses various footpaths to visit some of the highlights of the area. Starting in the town you head north and pick up the High Peak Trail to take you up to the Black Rocks around Cromford. From here there are splendid views of the Derwent Valley from the elevated position of the rocks. You can then descend to the Cromford Canal where you have the option of a stroll along the towpath and visiting the historic Cromford Mill. Around here you can also pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way and enjoy a riverside walk to Matlock Bath. From the river the walk then heads back across Cromford Moor to Wirksworth on bridleways.",

      "content": "Near Matlock you'll find one of the highlights of the area at Cromford Mill. This site is a significant part of the wider Derwent Valley Mills UNESCO World Heritage Site. It includes the world's first successful water powered cotton spinning mill which was built in 1771 by Sir Richard Arkwright. Near here you'll also pass the noteworthy High Peak Junction where the canal joins with the High Peak Trail. The junction now has a visitor centre with information about this historic area. The site includes various buildings from the former Cromford and High Peak Railway which was one of the first long distance railways which was built on canal principles. You can also find details of wildlife in the area which includes little grebes and water voles. Another highlight of the town is the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway. The heritage railway has its headquarters at Wirksworth station. It's a lovely way of viewing the valley on a fine old steam locomotive. The Ecclesbourne Way walking trail follows the route of the railway from Duffield to Wirksworth. The route passes several of the stations on the route and offers fine views of the surrounding countryside as well. It also passes close to Alport Heights just to the south of the town. There's a car park, a circular trail and an excellent viewpoint to be found at this beauty spot. For more walking ideas in the area see the Derbyshire Walks and Peak District Walks pages."
