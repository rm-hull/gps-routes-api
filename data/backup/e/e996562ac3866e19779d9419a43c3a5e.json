  "description": "This circular walk around the Derbyshire town of Wirksworth uses various footpaths to visit some of the highlights of the area. Starting in the town you head north and pick up the High Peak Trail to take you up to the Black Rocks around Cromford. From here there are splendid views of the Derwent Valley from the elevated position of the rocks. You can then descend to the Cromford Canal where you have the option of a stroll along the towpath and visiting the historic Cromford Mill. Around here you can also pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way and enjoy a riverside walk to Matlock Bath. From the river the walk then heads back across Cromford Moor to Wirksworth on bridleways.",
