  "description": "This Derbyshire based village is a popular starting point for Peak District walks with a number of fine local hill climbs to try. There's also an 18th century packhorse bridge over the River Dove and a noteworthy 16th century pub to relax in after your exercise. This walk from the village takes you up to two of the local viewpoints at High Wheeldon and Chrome Hill . You'll also visit the neighbouring village of Earl Sterndale on the way. From the high points there are wonderful views over the Upper Dove Valley area of the Peak District. To continue your walking around the village you could head east to visit Lathkill Dale or south to the famous stepping stones in glorious Dovedale .",
