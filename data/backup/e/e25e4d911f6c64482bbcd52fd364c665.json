      "content": "Head east of the hall to Saxton and you can pick up the popular Towton Battlefield Walk. The historical walk explores the site of the 15th century Battle of Towton, a significant conflict during the English Wars of the Roses. The circular Aberford Walk starts in the nearby village and explores the surrounding countryside before visiting the hall. Parlington Woods on the historic Parlington Hall Estate can be visited near here as well. South west of the estate you will find the town of Garforth. The Garforth Walk starts from the train station and visits the Aire and Calder Navigation Canal and the lovely RSPB St Aidan's nature reserve. There's excellent birdwatching opportunities and fine scenery here. There's another historical house and estate not far from Lotherton in the shape of Temple Newsam. There's 1500 acres of parkland to explore here with a series of woodland trails, pretty ponds, landscaped gardens and the Dunstan Hills. The expansive estate surrounds a fine Tudor-Jacobean house with hundreds of years of history. Just north of the estate you can pick up the Hazlewood Castle Walk and visit the nearby country estate. Here you'll find expansive bluebell woods and a mountain bike trail located to the west of the 18th century mansion which is now run as a hotel. Just to the west you can explore the villages of Barwick-in-Elmet and Thorner. Here you could visit Bramham Park where there are hundreds of acres of parkland, gardens, woodland and countryside to explore. The landscaped park surrounds the historic 18th century Bramham House which is a Grade I listed building."
