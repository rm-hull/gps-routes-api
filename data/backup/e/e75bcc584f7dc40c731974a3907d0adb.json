      "content": "The Waterbeach Walk visits the park from the train station in the nearby village. It's a nice way of coming to the park using public transport and the riverside trail along the Cam. There's also a fine waterside pub to visit in the village at the end of the walk. Just to the north is the delightful Wicken Fen. The nature reserve is a great place for walking and cycling with flowering meadows, reedbeds, waterways and an abundance of wildlife to see. The Lodes Way can also be picked up here. This circular walk or cycle follows National Cycle Route 11 through the Cambridgeshire Lodes, a series of ancient man made waterways created to link a series of Fenland villages to the River Cam. On the way it visits the Jacobean mansion of Anglesey Abbey. The historic site includes some beautiful gardens with ornate statues and herbaceous borders. The circular Soham Walk starts from the nearby town. It visits Wicken Fen before heading north along the river to link up with another waterside path along Soham Lode. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cambridgeshire Walks page."
