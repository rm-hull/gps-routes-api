  "description": "Enjoy a stroll around this area of ancient woodland and dry heath, located near Watford. The walk starts from Bricket Wood railway station which is a short hop from the common. Here you can pick up the trails running across the site which includes ponds, streams and a variety of wildlife. Look out for various woodland birds and different types of butterfly during the warmer months. The Ver-Colne Valley Walk skirts the eastern edge of the common. The riverside trail will takes you along the rivers Ver and Colne which run through the surrounding area. The waymarked footpath is a great way to extend your walk from the common.",
