  "description": "This coastal walk takes you along the South West Coast Path from Looe To Seaton Beach in Cornwall. The route runs for just under 4 miles along the undulating path. From the cliff top sections there are wonderful views over Looe Bay and Whitsand Bay . You'll also pass a noteworthy local attraction at Looe's Monkey Sanctuary where you can view the woolly monkeys in there large enclosures. The path passes the sanctuary just over half way along the route. The walk starts of on the lovely Looe Beach next to the pier. You then head east along the beach to pick up the waymarked coastal path. This will take you east to Plaidy and Millendreath Beach where there is a pleasant sandy beach in a sheltered cove. You continue east past Colmer Rocks and Keveral Beach before finishing at Seaton Beach.",
