  "description": "This waymarked trail takes you along the Brent River in the capital. It runs for about 5 miles along a nice flat trail with plenty of wildlife, a series of weirs and some riverside parks to see on the way. The walk starts on the river just south of Perivale in the Brentham Meadows park where there are some pretty wildflowers in the summer months. You then head west following the river through Pitshanger Park to Perivale Golf Course near Greenford. The river then bends to the south taking you past Dormer's Wells and Hanwell to the point where the river meets with the Grand Union Canal. You have the option of heading west along the canal and then north to create a longer circular walk if you choose. This route continues along the river to finish at another pretty riverside park in the shape of Eltherstone Park near Boston Manor tube and the outskirts of Brentford. It's a nice end to the walk with the Osterley Lock Orchard here as well.",
