  "description": "Taunton is the county town of Somerset and a lovely place to explore on foot. There's an anicent castle, three picturesque public parks, two canals, riverside footpaths, several local woodland areas, nature reserves and lots of great walking options in the nearby Blackdown Hills AONB. This circular waterside walk takes you along the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal to the neighbouring village of Creech St Michael before returning along the River Tone. The easy walk runs for a distance of just under 7 miles, passing Bathpool and some interesting old bridges on the way. You can extend the walk by heading west from the town along the Grand Western Canal. This runs from Taunton to Tiverton in Devon. Also in the town is the waymarked Taunton Heritage Trail which visits several of the town's historic properties. For more detail on the Landmarks, Nature Reserves and History of the town please see the informative wikipedia page.",
