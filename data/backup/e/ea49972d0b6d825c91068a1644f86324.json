  "description": "This 17th-century\u00a0country house in the Severn Valley is surrounded by landscaped gardens, parkland, managed woodlands, lakes and farmland. The extensive park is a great place for walkers and can be easily reached on our Bridgnorth Circular Walk . On the northern side of the hall there's peaceful trails around the adjacent Comer Woods . The woods have their own car park and entrance and are free to access. There's a number of picturesque pools and lots of woodland birds to see in this area. The River Severn runs past the hall so you can enjoy riverside trails along the Severn Way and Geopark Way long distance trails. Look out for the wonderful old steam trains running along the Severn Valley Railway as you go.",
