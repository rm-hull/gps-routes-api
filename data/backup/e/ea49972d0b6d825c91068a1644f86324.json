  "description": "This 17th-century country house in the Severn Valley is surrounded by landscaped gardens, parkland, managed woodlands, lakes and farmland. The extensive park is a great place for walkers and can be easily reached on our Bridgnorth Circular Walk. On the northern side of the hall there's peaceful trails around the adjacent Comer Woods. The woods have their own car park and entrance and are free to access. There's a number of picturesque pools and lots of woodland birds to see in this area. The River Severn runs past the hall so you can enjoy riverside trails along the Severn Way and Geopark Way long distance trails. Look out for the wonderful old steam trains running along the Severn Valley Railway as you go.",

      "content": "The parkland and woodland trails make for an excellent dog walk so you'll probably see plenty of other dogs on your visit. In the park area they need to be on leads but in Comer Woods they can be off lead. Dogs are not allowed in the garden, tea-room and mansion areas though."

      "content": "Just half a mile west of the hall you'll find the lovely Chelmarsh Reservoir. There's a circular waterside trail running alongside the lake here. On the walk you'll enjoy views of the River Severn and visit the little village of Chelmarsh. Head south along the river from the park and you will soon come to the popular Severn Valley Country Park. There's a 126 acre park to explore here with lots of wildlife and an informative visitor centre. The circular Hampton Loade Walk visits both the country park and the reservoir from the nearby village. There's a Severn Valley Railway station and a 17th century pub in this pretty riverside village which lies just to the south, on the opposite side of the river. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Walks page."
