  "description": "This circular walk around the village of Chedworth visits the fascinating Chedworth Roman Villa and Chedworth Woods. The walk starts in Chedworth and follows the Macmillan Way long distance trail to the National Trust owned villa. Here you will find the ruins of a large, 4th century Romano-British villa complete with wonderful mosaics, bathhouses and latrines. You can also see costumed guides bring Roman history to life and join a free tour of the site. The walk then continues through the lovely Chedworth woods, returning to Chedworth on public footpaths. For much of the walk you are also surrounded by some beautiful Cotswolds countryside. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Macmillan Way or the Monarch's Way which both run through the area.",
