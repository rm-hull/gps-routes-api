  "description": "This circular walk in Swaledale takes you through the lovely Gunnerside Gill. It's a beautiful valley with imposing scars, woodland, waterfalls and the pretty Gunnerside Beck running through the centre. The area has a fascinating industrial history having been a significant area for lead mining in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. You will pass several ruined buildings from this period including the remains of Blakethwaite Smelt Mill and the old mine offices. This circular walk starts in the pretty village of Gunnerside where you will find a parking area, a pub and tea rooms for refreshments. You then follow footpaths north along Gunnerside Beck to Gunnerside Gill. The walk then crosses the beck and returns through some lovely Yorkshire Dales countryside.",
