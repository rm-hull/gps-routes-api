  "description": "This pleasant waterside walk takes you around Chichester Marina and Birdham Pool Marina in West Sussex. It's a very pretty area with lots of great boats to admire and some fine sea views over Chichester Harbour. You can start the walk from the marina car park at postcode PO20 7EG for your sat navs. You can then follow the public footpaths around the site before crossing the Chichester Canal to Birdham Pool where there's another nice marina. You can extend the walk by following the coastal path north to the nearby Dell Quay. There's the Crown & Anchor pub here which does very good seafood and has a large waterside terrace with great views. There's also the option of following the previously mentioned Chichester Canal north east from the marina. It will take you all the way into Chichester via Hunston.",
