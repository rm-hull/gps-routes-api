  "description": "Explore the beautiful gardens surrounding this neo-Palladian villa in West London. The 65 acre gardens were restored in the 18th century and are perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll. There are wide lawns, an artificial river, a lake and a beautiful waterfall descending a series of rock steps through three archways. To extend your walking in the area you could try our circular Chiswick Riverside Walk along the Thames Path .The river runs just to the east of the house and can be followed west to the splendid Kew Gardens and Syon Park in Brentford.",
