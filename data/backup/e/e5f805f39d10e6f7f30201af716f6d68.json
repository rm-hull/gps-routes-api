  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside stroll along the Poulaphouca Reservoir on this walk in Blessington, County Wicklow. The reservoir is often referred to as two 'lakes' as it lies in two river valleys - that of the Liffey and, primarily, that of the King River. The site includes a lovely trail running along the western side of the water from the town of Blessington to Russeltown. Known as the Blessington Greenway it runs for about 3.5 miles, passing through lakeside woodland, with great views across the water to the surrounding hills. Look out for various birds on the water including the goosander, recently arrived as a breeding species in Ireland. The route finishes close to Russborough House which is one of the highlights of the area. The 18th century mansion houses the world-famous Albert Beit collection of art and offers fascinating guided tours. There's also a nice cafe where you can enjoy refreshments after your exercise. The lakes are located close to Dublin and can be reached in about 30 minutes by car. To continue your waterside walking in Wicklow, head east and visit the beautiful Lough Dan. The ribbon shaped lake is a popular venue for walkers with nice woodland trails and views of the surrounding Wicklow mountains.",
