    "description": "This small market town lies on the boundary of the Lake District National Park. There's some nice coastal and riverside trails to follow through the surrounding area. This walk takes you along a section of the Cumbria Coastal Way from Broughton in Furness to the Sandscale Haws National Nature Reserve near Dalton-in-Furness. There's lovely views of Duddon Sands and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The walk starts in the town where you can pick up the waymarked Cumbria Coastal Way and follow it south to Foxfield on Duddon Sands. The route then follows quiet country lanes to Kirkby-in-Furness, passing Waltham Common on the way. The trail continues south right along Duddon Sands, passing Askham in Furness before coming to Sandscale Haws National Nature Reserve. Here you can explore the sandy estuary of the River Duddon with the backdrop of Lake District mountains. There's an expansive sand dunes and wildlife including Natterjack Toad, Great Crested Newts, wintering wildfowl, Pintail, Red Knot, Curlews and Common Redshank to look out for. After exploring the reserve the route heads back to Askham in Furness where you can catch the train back to Foxfield and then return to Broughton on the same paths. To continue your walking in the area head west from the town to visit the Duddon Mosses Nature Reserve. There's wildlife such as deer, lizards, adders and barn owls to look out for here. You could then head north and explore Dunnerdale and the River Duddon. The village is also located on the edge of the Lake District with the southern end of Coniston Water located just a few miles to the north east. There's some nice waterside trails to try here.",

From the canal basin it's a short climb up to the impressive Ulverston Lighthouse or Hoad Monument. There's great views from the top of the hill and the 19th century monument. The distinctive structure commemorates the life and work of Sir John Barrow who was born in Ulverston in 1764. The circular Barrow in Furness Walk also visits the reserve and the historic Furness Abbey. The ruined 12th century abbey is one of the highlights of the area and well worth a visit. On the western side of Barrow there's also Walney Island to explore. The scenic island includes two more nature reserves and the only grey seal colony in Cumbria. You can pick up the long distance Cistercian Way here too. A few miles to the north west you'll find the mysterious Swinside Stone Circle. It's a beautiful, remote spot with the Lake District mountains making a fine backdrop to the ancient stones. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lake District Walks and the Cumbria Walks pages."
