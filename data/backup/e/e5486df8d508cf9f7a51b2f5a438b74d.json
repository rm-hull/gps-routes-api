  "description": "Explore the New Forest's Blackwater Arboretum on two super waymarked walking trails. The Blackwater Tall Trees Trail runs along the Rhinefield Ornamental Drive to Brock Hill on good footpaths. The trail is lined with majestic Douglas fir trees which are among the tallest and oldest trees in Britain. There are also two enormous redwoods visible from the path. The shorter Blackwater Sensory Trail encourages you to discover the many different smells, textures and sounds of the trees. If you enjoy this trail you could head to the nearby Knightwood Oak where you will find the largest oak tree in the forest. Also nearby is the delightful Ober Water. The Arboretum is located just a few miles south west of Lyndhurst and not far from Burley where there are some nice trails through the Old and New Inclosures. The major village of Brockenhurst, with its main line train station is also just to the south east.",
