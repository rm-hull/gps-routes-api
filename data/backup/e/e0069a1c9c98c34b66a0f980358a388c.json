  "description": "This walk from the settlement follows a section of the Berwickshire Coastal Path to neighbouring St Abbs Head. It's about a 5 mile hike to the headland, so roughly 10 miles there and back. The walk starts at the picturesque Eyemouth Harbour where you can pick up the Berwickshire Coastal Path and follow it north west to Hairy Ness, Killiedraught Bay, Linkim Kip and Coldingham Bay before coming to the village of St Abbs. The route then continues north past Starney Bay, Halterem's Loup, Wuddy Rocks, Burnmouth Harbour and Horncastle Bay before coming to St Abbs Head. There's a wonderful viewpoint here and lots of wildlife to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for Guillemots, Kittiwakes, Puffins, Razorbills and even dolphins as you make your way along the cliff path.",
