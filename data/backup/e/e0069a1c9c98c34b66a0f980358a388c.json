  "description": "This walk from the settlement follows a section of the Berwickshire Coastal Path to neighbouring St Abbs Head. It's about a 5 mile hike to the headland, so roughly 10 miles there and back. The walk starts at the picturesque Eyemouth Harbour where you can pick up the Berwickshire Coastal Path and follow it north west to Hairy Ness, Killiedraught Bay, Linkim Kip and Coldingham Bay before coming to the village of St Abbs. The route then continues north past Starney Bay, Halterem's Loup, Wuddy Rocks, Burnmouth Harbour and Horncastle Bay before coming to St Abbs Head. There's a wonderful viewpoint here and lots of wildlife to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for Guillemots, Kittiwakes, Puffins, Razorbills and even dolphins as you make your way along the cliff path.",

The house was built in 1753 and includes a museum and a \u2018tea chute\u2019- the only one of its kind, where smuggled tea was hidden from prying eyes. You can find the house on Gunsgreen Quay, TD14 5SD. The Coldingham Bay to St Abbs and Coldingham Loch Walk will take you on to the pretty Coldingham Loch and into the village of the same name. Just west of St Abbs Head you'll find the historic Fast Castle. The photogenic ruins of the 14th century structure are located in a fine spot on a rocky headland overlooking the sea. For some local history you could head west to Edin's Hall Broch where you can explore the remains of a 2nd century broch while enjoying some fine views over the area."
