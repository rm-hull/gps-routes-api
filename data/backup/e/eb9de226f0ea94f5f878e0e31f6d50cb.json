  "description": "Climb to the top of Hope Mountain on this walk through Waun-y-llyn Country Park in Hope, Flintshire. The top of the mountain is really beautiful, with a small lake and wonderful views over the surrounding countryside. This circular walk starts from the car park and takes you up to the high point on the mountain. There's great views to Deeside, Chester and Liverpool from this viewpoint. You could also start the walk from nearby Hope or Caergwrle. Footpaths take you through peaceful woodland to the country park which is only about a mile from both villages. If you enjoy this walk then you could head to the nearby Alyn Waters Country Park where you'll find woodland trails and riverside walks along the River Alyn. The park is located near to Wrexham. Just to the south east you could enjoy some local history at Caergwrle Castle. Here you'll find a ruined 13th century castle with fine views to the surrounding hills and mountains.",
