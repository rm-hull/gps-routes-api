  "description": "A circular walk from the village of Therfield in Hertfordshire. The walk explores the village before visiting Fox Covert Nature Reserve and Therfield Heath. The settlement is very attractive with a picturesque village green, pretty cottages and an historic pub dating back to the early 18th century. The route makes use of the Hertfordshire Chain Walk and the Icknield Way Path to create a circular route, taking you through the countryside surrounding the heath. It's a lovely place for a walk with splendid views from the high points and a wide variety of flora and fauna to enjoy. For an alternative shorter route through the area see the Royston Heath Walk .",

These include summarised accounts from 1900 to 1926 showing the impact of WW1 on the village pub. The pub serves high quality food which you can enjoy in the garden area with views of the village. You can find them at postcode SG8 9PN for your sat navs."
