  "description": "This historic village is located in Upper Wharfedale in the Yorkshire Dales. The River Wharfe flows through the little settlement at the point where Langstrothdale meets Wharfedale. It's a secluded and attractive place with a Norman church and a mid 17th century pub for refreshments. Walkers can enjoy lovely riverside walks along the Dales Way or a more challenging climb to Buckden Pike. The hill is one of the more popular climbs in the area. This circular walk from the village takes you west along the Dales Way to Yockenthwaite in Langstrothdale. You'll then climb to Yockenthwaite Pot for some splendid views over the area. The walk starts in the village and follows the waymarked footpath west to Yockenthwaite where you'll find the Yockenthwaite Cave and an ancient stone circle. You can then enjoy a climb to Yockenthwaite Pot where there's a footpath heading east along Hubberholme Wood and Todd's Wood. There's some fine views over the surrounding Dales scenery from this elevated spot. The walk then descends to the small village of Cray where there's nice views of the Cow Ghyll and the picturesque Cray Waterfalls. There's also the noteworthy White Lion pub, the highest inn in Wharfedale. From here you follow a footpath south west along the Cray Gill to return to Hubberholme.",

      "content": "The George Inn is an historic Grade II listed pub dating back to the 1600s. The white-washed building has mullioned windows, thick stone walls, heavy oak beams and flagged floors. The pub is well known for the lit candle that sits on the bar to indicate the pub is open and serving. The tradition dates from auctions for agricultural land or grazing that are still held in The George. The last bid to be received before the candle extinguished is the winner. The pub is thought to have been a local haunt of author JB Priestley who loved the village and its surroundings. Priestley is probably best known for his play 'An Inspector Calls'. The pub serves good quality food and is particularly known for its delicious homemade pies. It sits just opposite the Norman church which is well worthy of some investigation. In Cray you could stop off at the White Lion. There's original beams, an open log fire and stoneflagged floors at this charming inn. The pub dates from the 1600s when it was an old drovers' inn. You can find them at postcode BD23 5JB."
