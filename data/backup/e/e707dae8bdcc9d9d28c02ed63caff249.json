  "description": "This historic village is located in Upper Wharfedale in the Yorkshire Dales. The River Wharfe flows through the little settlement at the point where Langstrothdale meets Wharfedale. It's a secluded and attractive place with a Norman church and a mid 17th century pub for refreshments. Walkers can enjoy lovely riverside walks along the Dales Way or a more challenging climb to Buckden Pike . The hill is one of the more popular climbs in the area. This circular walk from the village takes you west along the Dales Way to Yockenthwaite in Langstrothdale. You'll then climb to Yockenthwaite Pot for some splendid views over the area. The walk starts in the village and follows the waymarked footpath west to Yockenthwaite where you'll find the Yockenthwaite Cave and an ancient stone circle. You can then enjoy a climb to Yockenthwaite Pot where there's a footpath heading east along Hubberholme Wood and Todd's Wood. There's some fine views over the surrounding Dales scenery from this elevated spot. The walk then descends to the small village of Cray where there's nice views of the Cow Ghyll and the picturesque Cray Waterfalls. There's also the noteworthy White Lion pub, the highest inn in Wharfedale. From here you follow a footpath south west along the Cray Gill to return to Hubberholme.",
