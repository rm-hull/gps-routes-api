    "description": "This circular walk visits the 19th century Blackpool Mill in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park . The historic water mill sits in a scenic location with some nice trails along the River Cleddau to try. You can start the walk by the parking area near to the mill and Blackpool Bridge. The route then picks up a section of the Knights Way and follows the waymarked footpath west along the river to the remains of Sister's House. You then head east along a bridleway to Minwear Farm before turning north for a woodland section through Minwear Wood. There's a picnic area here where you could stop for a rest and refreshment. Part of this route uses the South of the Landsker Trail , a long distance footpath which can be used to extend your walk. The circular Narberth Walk uses part of the trail to visit the mill and the nearby Canaston Woods from the market town.",
