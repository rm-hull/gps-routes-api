  "description": "This circular walk visits a striking limestone cliff in the village of Kilnsey in Wharfedale. Start the walk near Conistone Bridge where there is a parking area. From here you can follow a footpath north west towards Scar Lathe and Kilnsey Crag. The route then takes you south west down Mastiles Lane which is an old Roman Road. It can be followed all the way to Malham Tarn with full details on the Mastiles Lane Route. This route, however, turns east along the How Gill. This will lead you across Kilnsey Park back to Conistone Bridge. The walk circles around the Kilnsey Park which has a number of attractions to visit. These include a trout farm and nature trails with with wildlife such as red squirrels, angora goats, alpacas and butterflies to look out for on the way. There's also the Caf\u00e9 by the Lake where you can relax outside and enjoy fine views over the Yorkshire Dales while enjoying a good home cooked dish from the menu. The park and crag can be reached from nearby Grassington by following the Dales Way long distance walk from the town. See the Grassington to Conistone Walk for more details.",
