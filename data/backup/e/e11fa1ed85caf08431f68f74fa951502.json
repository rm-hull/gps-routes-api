It is very difficult nowadays to get a clear view of the bridge piers in the middle of the River Tyne (but rather easier in winter)."

  "description": "Enjoy a riverside walk or cycle along the River Tyne in this country park in Hexham. There are lovely tree lined avenues to stroll down, a golf course and club house, play area, cafe and watersports centre. Tyne Green is also good for birdwatching - look out for Goosander, Goldeneye and Teal on the river. The park is located right next to Hexham railway station. You can extend your walking in the area by picking up the Weardale Way and following it north to Chester's Roman Fort on Hadrian's Wall. Our Hexham Walk runs past the park and will guide you all the way there.",
