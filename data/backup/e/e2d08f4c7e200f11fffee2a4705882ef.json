  "description": "This Lancashire based town is located between Accrington and Blackburn in the Hyndburn borough of the county. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs just to the north providing good local walking and cycling opportunities along the easy towpath. This walk takes you south to Oswaldtwistle Moor and Haslingden Moor which form part of the wider West Pennine Moors. At the southern end of the walk you'll also enjoy a pleasant waterside trail around Calf Hey Reservoir using a section of the long distance Rossendale Way. On the way there's wonderful views across the beautiful Valley of Haslingden Grane and the photogenic Oswaldtwistle Wind Farm to admire.",
