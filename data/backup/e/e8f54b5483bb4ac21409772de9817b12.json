In 1825 it was reported that, \"in digging about them, urns made of the coarsest clay, containing human dust and bones were found\".\nDuring the mid and later 19th century certain academics had declared the Calderstones to have been part of a\u00a0druidical circle. In the closing years of the century\u00a0Professor W.A. Herdman\u00a0returned to the earlier evidence and concluded that the stones were once part of a ruined\u00a0dolmen\u00a0which had been mistakenly taken for a circle due to the false impression held that all\u00a0druidical\u00a0remains should be so arranged. The stones were relocated by Joseph Need Walker during his ownership, becoming a gateway feature to the eponymous estate.\u00a0The stones are now housed in the Harthill Greenhouses in Calderstones Park, having been moved from their previous location in an enclosure just outside the park gates in 1954 to protect them from further weathering. Nearby\u00a0Robin Hood's Stone\u00a0was originally one of the Calderstones, and has been relocated."

      "caption": "Japanese Garden. After World War II, Percy Conn, the new Superintendent of Liverpool Parks, envisioned recreating the Liverpool Botanic Garden, originally established by William Roscoe and John Shepherd at Mount Pleasant, within the Harthill Estate grounds at Calderstones Park. This project commenced in 1951 and was completed in 1964, culminating in the opening of 16 connected glasshouses. The Calderstones botanical garden boasted nearly 4,000 plant species from around the globe, collected by merchants and travellers.\nDue to post-war financial constraints, low-grade spruce was used instead of teak to construct the glasshouses. By 1979, these structures had deteriorated significantly. The early 1980s were marked by severe economic challenges for Liverpool City, preventing the reconstruction of the glasshouses. Despite this, the park's botanical significance spurred further horticultural enhancements, including a Japanese garden created by park apprentices in 1969 and a 'bog garden' linked to the artificial lake. The glasshouses were closed in 1984, and the plants were moved to the Liverpool City nursery at Garston, remaining there for 23 years. Some of these plants were occasionally displayed at the Southport Flower Shows. In 2007/2008, a third of the plants were relocated to four glasshouses within Croxteth Hall's walled gardens following the closure of Garston Nursery due to the outsourcing of Liverpool's Park & Garden maintenance."
