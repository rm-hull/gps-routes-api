  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful grounds of this 16th century stately home in Long Melford, Suffolk. There is much to explore including the lovely Walled Garden with Herb Garden, Potager and fruit trees. There are also moats with two original bridges, a Wildlife Pond, a Ha-Ha and woodland with Ancient Yews & Cedars. You can also stroll up the three quarter mile long avenue of ancient lime trees with the hall at the far end making a wonderful backdrop. The site includes a rare breed farm with Tamworth pigs, Bagot Goats and Poitou Donkeys. You can also tour the house with its grand rooms and furniture. Melford Hall is very close and is a good option if you would like to continue your walk. You could also pick up the long distance St Edmund Way and follow it east to the delightful village of Lavenham .",
