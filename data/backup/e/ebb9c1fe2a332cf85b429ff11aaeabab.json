It has an interesting history having started its life as the village Rectory. The centre portion of the building was then built in 1584, and around 1728 the east wing was added and the west end was built in 1773. There's two restaurants and the Snooty Fox Bar which provides a warm, casual, cosy atmosphere for guests and non-residents to relax in. The bar faces the lawned garden allowing guests to sit outside and enjoy the country air. You can find the hotel on the High Street with a postcode of BN14 0TA for your sat navs."
