The hall is part of a vast 3,800-acre estate, traversed by the River Nene, featuring architectural elements from the 15th, 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. It is recognised as a Grade I listed building. Located just 2 miles from Fotheringhay Castle, the site of Mary, Queen of Scots' execution in 1587, Elton Hall holds a significant place in English history."
