  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Loch Laggan on the Ardverikie Estate in the Scottish Highlands. At the eastern end of the large loch you will find the little hamlet of Kinloch Lagan and a lovely sandy beach. It is notable as the largest freshwater beach in Britain. The tranquil area is a splendid place for an easy stroll with fine views across the still waters to the surrounding hills and mountains. The walk starts from a lay by on the A86 situated approximately \u00bc mile west of Gatelodge. This is by the main entrance to the Ardverikie Estate on the banks of the River Pattack. The striking building includes a fairy tale turret and spiral staircase. There is high quality accommodation here too. Cross the bridge and you can then access the beach area. If you head west along the loch you could also visit the magnificent Ardverikie House. The 19th-century Scottish baronial  house was made famous as the fictional Glenbogle estate in the BBC series Monarch of the Glen.",
