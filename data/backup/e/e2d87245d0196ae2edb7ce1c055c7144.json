  "description": "This walk explores Badbury Hill and the lovely wooded area of Badbury Clump near Faringdon. There is a car park next to the site just off the B4019 between Faringdon and Coleshill. You can then pick up the trails through the bluebell woodland to the summit of the hill where there is an Iron Age hill fort known as Badbury Camp. There are also nice views over the Vale of White Horse to the south and the Thames Valley. You can continue your walk in the surrounding Coxwell Wood. The route below is designed for walkers but the area is also popular with mountain bikers. There is a downhill course on the side of the hill with jumps, rollers, tabletops, drops and loamy corners. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could visit the nearby Buscot Park. There's 100 acres to explore with woodland, lakes and formal gardens. You could also try our Faringdon Circular Walk and enjoy a climb to the splendid Faringdon Folly where there are more great views to enjoy.",
