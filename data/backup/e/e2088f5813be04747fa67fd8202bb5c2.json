  "description": "A splendid coastal walk along a section of the Cleveland Way from Whitby to the lovely Runswick Bay. There's stunning beaches, dramatic cliff tops and the pretty village of Sandsend to see on the way. Starting in the town head north to Whitby Sands and then turn left to Upgang Beach. The walk continues west towards Sandsend where you could divert off the path to visit Mulgrave Woods . The woods are great for walkers with miles of tracks and the ruins of the Norman Mulgrave Castle. The route continues to Sandsend Ness, an old alum quarrying site dating from the 17th century. There's interesting geological features here in a moonscape style setting. The next stage takes you to Kettleness where there is a beach popular with fossil hunters. Dinosaur and ammonite are regularly found along the foreshore and in the cliff. The final section passes along Runswick Sands before finishing at Runswick Bay. The delightful fishing village is a highlight of the Yorkshire coast with its sandy beach, sheltered bay and pretty little cottages. The white thatched property on the seafront is the only remaining thatched house on the Yorkshire coast. You can enjoy refreshments at one of the many cafes or hotels with lovely views over the bay. After exploring the village you can catch a bus directly back to Whitby. To extend your walking in the area you could head south along the coast path on the Whitby to Robin's Hood Bay Walk . It's another very popular section of the path with views of the River Esk and a visit to the atmospheric ruins of Whitby Abbey. You could also head north on the Saltburn to Whitby Walk . This walk visits Staithes, Skinningrove and Boulby where there are some of the highest cliffs in England, at 203 metres (666 ft) above sea level.",
