  "description": "This Welsh village in the Clwydian mountain range is a popular place for walkers. There's local forest trails, country parks and numerous hill climbs with amazing views. There's also some historical interest with a medieval church and a fine old pub dating to the early 19th century. The settlement is located near to Maeshafn and Mold in the county of Flintshire. This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the area including Ffrith Mountain, Loggerheads Country Park and Moel Famau Country Park. The walk starts in the village and heads south past the Cilcain Reservoir to visit one of the highlights of the area at Moel Famau. Here you'll find a wonderful viewpoint and the 19th century Jubilee Tower constructed in 1810 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of King George III. The route then heads north east to Ffrith Mountain. You can follow grassy and woodland paths along the northern edge of the Clwyd Forest to the mountain. You then head south to visit Loggerheads. The expansive park is a fine location for walkers with peaceful woodland trails, dramatic limestone cliffs, wooded gorges and river views to enjoy. From here you head north and then west to return to the village.",
