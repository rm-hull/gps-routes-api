  "description": "This walk takes you to the stunning natural cavern  of Thor's Cave in the Manifold Valley area of the Peak District. There is a good footpath through the countryside from the nearby village of Wetton which takes you to the cave. Once there you can enter the cave and enjoy the fascinating rock formations and mineral colours. It's a magical place with interesting nooks and crannies to explore. There are also great views of the Manifold Valley through the cave entrance. You can return to Wetton along the same path and then enjoy refreshments at the 18th century Royal Oak Inn. It's also nice to have a stroll around Wetton Village with its little cottages, village green and church which has a 14th century tower. The River Manifold and the Manifold Way run right past the caves so an alternative route would be to start from Waterhouses and follow the lovely riverside path to the cave. If you'd like to cycle to the cave you can hire bikes from the Manifold Valley Cycle Centre and follow the Manifold Way to the cave. If you'd like to extend your walking in the area then you could visit the nearby Dovedale where you will find a lovely walking path along the River Dove to the famous stepping stones.",
