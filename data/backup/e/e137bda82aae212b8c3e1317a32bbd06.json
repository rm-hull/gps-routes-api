  "description": "This short walk climbs to a fine viewpoint above the city of Winchester. From the top of the hill there are great views of the city's main highlights including Winchester Cathedral, the College and Wolvesey Castle. The hill is located just to the east of the city centre and can be reached by following The Broadway and then Bridge Street to the base of the hill. Here you follow a series of steep steps to the hill top where you will find a little park with benches, an information board and the observation area. The hill is located next to the River Itchen where you can enjoy riverside paths on the Winchester River Walk . It's a great option for extending your walk in the city. You could also pick up The South Downs Way National Trail which runs right past the hill. If you follow it east it will take you into the National Park where you can enjoy a longer climb to Cheesefoot Head . Just to the south you can try another short climb to St Catherine's Hill . It's a very pretty area with the chalk downland\u00a0covered in wild flowers with great views over the South Downs.",
