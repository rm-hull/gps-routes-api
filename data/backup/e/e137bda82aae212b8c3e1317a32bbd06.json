  "description": "This short walk climbs to a fine viewpoint above the city of Winchester. From the top of the hill there are great views of the city's main highlights including Winchester Cathedral, the College and Wolvesey Castle. The hill is located just to the east of the city centre and can be reached by following The Broadway and then Bridge Street to the base of the hill. Here you follow a series of steep steps to the hill top where you will find a little park with benches, an information board and the observation area. The hill is located next to the River Itchen where you can enjoy riverside paths on the Winchester River Walk. It's a great option for extending your walk in the city. You could also pick up The South Downs Way National Trail which runs right past the hill. If you follow it east it will take you into the National Park where you can enjoy a longer climb to Cheesefoot Head. Just to the south you can try another short climb to St Catherine's Hill. It's a very pretty area with the chalk downland covered in wild flowers with great views over the South Downs.",

It's dog friendly with a good menu and a nice riverside terrace for fine summer days. The classic English pub is located at number 1 High Street next to the Winchester Mill. The Queen Inn is located also located very close to the hill and a good option for some refreshments after the walk. They offer a tasty home made bar snack menu, along with sandwiches, including items such as scotch eggs and sausage rolls as well as offering home made cake. The pub is also dog friendly and includes a nice beer garden to relax in on warmer days. You can find it a short distance north of the hill car park on 28 Kingsgate Rd with a postcode of SO239PG for your sat navs."
