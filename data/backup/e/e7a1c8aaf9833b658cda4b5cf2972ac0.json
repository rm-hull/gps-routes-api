  "description": "This walk visits the Thomason Foss and the Mallyan Spout waterfalls from the little village of Beck Hole in North Yorkshire. The walk starts in the village and follows a footpath east along the Eller Beck to Thomason Foss Wood and the falls. The secluded spot is situated next to the line of the North York Moors railway about half a mile east of the village. The route then retraces its steps before turning south to Carr Wood, West Beck and the impressive Mallyan Spout near Goathland. The 70ft high falls are an impressive sight, especially after rainfall. The route then retraces its steps to Beck Hole though you could return via Goathland and turn it into a longer circular walk if you have time.",
