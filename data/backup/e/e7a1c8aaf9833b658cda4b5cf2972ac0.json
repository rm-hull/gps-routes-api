    "description": "This walk visits the Thomason Foss and the Mallyan Spout waterfalls from the little village of Beck Hole in North Yorkshire. The walk starts in the village and follows a footpath east along the Eller Beck to Thomason Foss Wood and the falls. The secluded spot is situated next to the line of the North York Moors railway about half a mile east of the village. The route then retraces its steps before turning south to Carr Wood, West Beck and the impressive Mallyan Spout near Goathland . The 70ft high falls are an impressive sight, especially after rainfall. The route then retraces its steps to Beck Hole though you could return via Goathland and turn it into a longer circular walk if you have time.",
