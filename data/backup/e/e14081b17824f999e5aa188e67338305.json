  "description": "This market town in Cheshire has an abundance of local options for walkers. There's canalside trails, an expansive forest, several pretty reservoirs and hill climbs with fabulous views over the Cheshire Plain. This circular walk from the town visits several of the area's walking highlights including the Macclesfield Canal, the neighbouring town of Bollington, the fine viewpoints at White Nancy and Tegg's Nose Country Park and the woodland trails at Macclesfield Forest and Trentabank Reservoir. You start on the canal to the east of the town centre. Head north along the towpath to Bollington where you can climb to White Nancy. The unusual folly is in the shape of a small domed sugar loaf and thought to have been built in 1817 by Colonel Gaskell as a monument to the Battle of Waterloo. There's great views from this elevated spot over the Cheshire Plain to the mountains of North Wales. From here you continue south along the popular Gritstone Trail to Tegg's Nose. There's a country park here with a visitor centre, viewpoint, reservoirs, woodland and some fine cycling trails to try. The route continues into Macclesfield Forest where there's a series of reservoirs and lots of wildlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for red deer and birds such as common sandpiper, green sandpiper and little ringed plover. Around here you can also enjoy a climb to the distinctive Shutlingsloe. The hill is known as the Cheshire Matterhorn due to its shape from certain directions. After exploring the forest the route heads west through Langley and Sutton Lane Ends to return to the canal. Follow the towpath north past Gurnett and it will soon return you to the town.",

      "content": "A few miles to the north there's the circular Pott Shrigley Walk which will take you around the old Shrigley Hall to the surrounding moors. Just south of Macclesfield the canal passes Sutton Reservoir and Danes Moss Nature Reserve. The reservoir is a nice place for a waterside stroll while the reserve has some pleasant boardwalks taking you over lowland raised bog. It's an interesting area with some rare flora and fauna to see. In this same area there's also the worthy village of Gawsworth. The village includes three noteworthy historic buildings including the 15th century Gawsworth Hall. The house and grounds of the historic Tudor house are well worth exploring. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks and the Peak District Walks pages."
