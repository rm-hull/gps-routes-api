It was built by Walkelin de Ferrers, a Norman baron, in about 1180-90. The remains of other parts of this fortified manor house lie beneath the grass of the inner bailey. It was surrounded by earthen banks and stone walls which had at least two towers. To the north were gardens and fishponds. The hall possesses a range of 12th century figure sculpture. Above the capitals of its fine columns there are six musicians, each playing a different instrument."

  "description": "Oakham is the county town of Rutland and located in a lovely spot with miles of country trails and the wonderful Rutland Water nearby. The medieval market town also includes many sites of historical interest including the Norman Oakham Castle and the renowned Oakham School which dates back to 1584. This walk takes you to Rutland Water from the town. You'll pass along the northern edge of the lake before visiting the dam. The walk starts from the train station and heads east along the Hereward Way passing Oakham Castle before leaving the town at Dog Kennel Cottage. Here you turn south east to meet up with the lakeside path. Follow it east and it will take you along the lake, passing Burley Reach and the Lodge Inlet before coming to the Barnsdale Hill Hotel and Barnsdale Wood. After passing through the little lakeside wood you come to the village of Whitwell where there's cycle hire and the departure point for the Rutland Belle Cruise. After passing Whitwell Creek you come to the eastern end of the lake where you'll find a Butterfly Centre and the dam. This route returns to Oakham on the same paths but you could stroll into Empingham and catch the bus back if you prefer.",
