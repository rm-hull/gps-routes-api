  "description": "This is a fairly easy climb to Silver How fell in the Lake District. It's a short circular walk starting in Grasmere and a nice one to try if you're looking for an introduction to fell walking. The walk passes the National Trust owned Allan Bank, the former home of William Wordsworth. It's a lovely place to stop for a drink or go for a stroll in the pretty garden. From the Silver How summit there are super views of Grasmere village and lake. Many of the famous fells are also visible such as Helm Crag, Steel Fell, Heron Pike and Fairfield. The walk descends from the summit with a woodland section taking you back to Grasmere. If you enjoy this walk then there are some similar ones to try starting in Grasmere. For example you could climb the nearby Helm Crag or visit the pretty Easedale Tarn . Both walks are similar in length and are also fairly easy climbs.",
