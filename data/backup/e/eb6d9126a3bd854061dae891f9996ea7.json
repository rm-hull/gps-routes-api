  "description": "This Bedfordshire based village sits on a major long distance trail and is surrounded by some lovely Chilterns countryside. There's also a picturesque village green, a fine market square, a 13th century church and several good pubs for rest and refreshment after your exercise. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Icknield Way Path, the John Bunyan Trail, the Chiltern Way and other public footpaths to visit two of the local walking highlights at Sundon Hills Country Park and Sharpenhoe Clappers. The route starts on the eastern side of the village where you can pick up the Icknield Way Path and follow the waymarked trail east to the Sundon Hills, crossing the train line and the M1 motorway as you go. The route then heads north east where you climb to the National Trust's Sharpenhoe Clappers. Here you'll find a classic chalk escarpment with woodland trails and fine views over the surrounding Chilterns countryside. The route then heads south, passing through the Smithcombe Valley before coming to the village of Streatley. You then head west back through the country park before turning south to visit Upper Sundon. The final section then follows bridle track west to Horse Hill Farm where you pick up the Icknield Way again and follow it north west to return to Toddington. The walk can easily be extended at the eastern end to visit Barton Hills National Nature Reserve where there's lots more interesting flora and fauna to see.",
