    "description": "Enjoy miles of nice woodland walking trails in this popular wood in Maulden, Bedfordshire.  The site consist of semi-natural broadleaf woodland, acidic grassland and some conifer plantations. You can access the woods by following the Greensand Ridge Walk from the village. The path takes you through some nice countryside to the woods where you can pick from several trails. The southern section takes you into Pennyfather's Woods with a path through more open countryside and grassland to enjoy. Look out for wildlife including deer, badgers and foxes. In the spring and summer months there are lots of wildflowers and bluebells. These attract a wide variety of butterflies including white admiral and purple hairstreak. This walk starts from the village of Maudlen but there is also a car park in the north eastern corner of the site, just off the A6. There's also a picnic area in the southern section. To extend your walk you could visit the nearby Ampthill Park where you can enjoy fabulous views from the Greensand Ridge. If you follow the Greensand Ridge Walk east it will take you through Clophill to Chicksands Wood and Rowney Warren Wood near Shefford . This large coniferous woodland has lots of footpaths, a BMX trail and a mountain bike trail.",
