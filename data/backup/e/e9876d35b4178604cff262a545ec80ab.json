  "description": "This circular walk explores the Ashworth Valley area of Rochdale. On the route you'll enjoy riverside paths, woodland trails, attractive countryside and hill climbs with fine views over Manchester. The walk starts in Norden on the western fringes of Rochdale. Here you can pick up the Rochdale Way and follow it south along the Naden Brook through Ashworth Wood. You continue through Carr Wood where you will pass a pretty waterfall and lots of bluebells in the spring. The route continues south through Gelder Wood and Bamford Wood before coming to Simpson Clough. Here you turn north west to follow the pretty Cheesden Brook to Heywood's Farm and Greengate Hill. This section climbs high above the valley to expose you to some fine, far reaching views over the surrounding area. At Greengate Hill the route then turns east along the Rochdale Way to return you to Norden where the walk finishes. It's easy to extend the walk if you have time. You could head a short distance north of Norden to visit Greenbooth Reservoir or follow the Rochdale Way north west to Ashworth Moor Reservoir. Here you'll find the 18th century Owd Betts pub which is a great place for refreshments after your walk.",
