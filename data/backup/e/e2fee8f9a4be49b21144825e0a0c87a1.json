  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this delightful reservoir near Holmfirth in the Yorkshire Dales. There are lovely views of the surrounding moorland, woodland and countryside to enjoy as you make your way around the water. The walk starts at the good sized car park at the North Eastern end of the reservoir off Gibriding Lane. You then pick up a good footpath running along the northern end of the reservoir on the Kirklees Way. You pass Bilberry reservoir and head through Digley Wood on the southern side of the water, before returning to the car park using Fieldhead Lane. The reservoir is located about 2 miles from Holmfirth so you could start the walk from the town and follow the Holme Valley Circular Walk to the reservoir as an alternative to parking at the car park. This takes you through an area associated with the sitcom Last of the Summer Wine which was filmed in Holmfirth and the surrounding area. You could also enjoy a stroll along the Digley Brook and River Holme at the eastern end of the reservoir or follow the Kirklees Way to the nearby Brownhill Reservoir and Ramsden Reservoir .",

In the town you can also visit Meltham Mills Reservoir, Honley Woods and the lovely Folly Dolly Falls which are something of a local hidden gem. Just to the north there's Blackmoorfoot Reservoir which is a good place for spotting wildfowl. Just a few miles to the east you'll find Holme Styes Reservoir where there are some peaceful woodland and waterside trails. To the south west there's the Holme Moss transmitter and Wilmer Hill where there are some excellent views to enjoy. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
