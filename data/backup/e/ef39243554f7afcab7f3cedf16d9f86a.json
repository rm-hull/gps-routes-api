  "description": "This pretty village on the fringe of the Howardian Hills includes the National Trust owned Nunnington Hall and nice footpaths along the River Rye which runs through the village. This easy circular walk starts at the old hall and takes you along the Rye to the village of Ness, passing a pretty weir and Ness Bridge on the way. You then head into the countryside, climbing Caulkleys Lane and Caulkleys Bank which reaches a height of over 300ft. From here you can enjoy splendid views over the surrounding area which includes the Howardian Hills. The route then passes Caulkleys Wood before turning north and returning to the village. You can also explore Nunnington Hall although this does require an entrance fee. The splendid 17th century manor house includes period rooms with exquisite funiture and artwork. The grounds are also delightful with an organic walled garden and spring-flowering meadows with resident peacocks. To extend your walking in the area you could head west and pick up the Ebor Way long distance trail. This will take you towards Helmsley where you can try the Helmsley to Rievaulx Abbey Walk and explore the fascinating ruins of the former Cistercian abbey and the wonderful gardens at Rievaulx Terrace. The area also includes the splendid Duncombe Park with its landscape garden and National Centre for Birds of Prey.",
