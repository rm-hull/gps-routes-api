  "description": "This pretty village on the fringe of the Howardian Hills includes the National Trust owned Nunnington Hall and nice footpaths along the River Rye which runs through the village. This easy circular walk starts at the old hall and takes you along the Rye to the village of Ness, passing a pretty weir and Ness Bridge on the way. You then head into the countryside, climbing Caulkleys Lane and Caulkleys Bank which reaches a height of over 300ft. From here you can enjoy splendid views over the surrounding area which includes the Howardian Hills. The route then passes Caulkleys Wood before turning north and returning to the village. You can also explore Nunnington Hall although this does require an entrance fee. The splendid 17th century manor house includes period rooms with exquisite funiture and artwork. The grounds are also delightful with an organic walled garden and spring-flowering meadows with resident peacocks. To extend your walking in the area you could head west and pick up the Ebor Way long distance trail. This will take you towards Helmsley where you can try the Helmsley to Rievaulx Abbey Walk and explore the fascinating ruins of the former Cistercian abbey and the wonderful gardens at Rievaulx Terrace. The area also includes the splendid Duncombe Park with its landscape garden and National Centre for Birds of Prey.",

      "content": "Just a few miles south west of the village there are miles of good walking and cycling trails in the expansive Yearsley Woods. Just a few miles to the south there's the delightful villages of Slingsby and Hovingham to visit. It's an idyllic and appealing place with a historic Saxon Church, a picturesque cricket pitch by the 18th century Hovingham Hall, a pretty beck and two fine hotels to relax in after your exercise. From here you can follow two local waymarked trails to one of the major highlights of the area at Castle Howard near Welburn. For more walking ideas in the area see the Howardian Hills Walks page."
