  "description": "This walk visits Selworthy Beacon and Bury castle in the splendid Holnicote Estate in Somerset. You start off in the village of Selworthy next to the church, and head to the nearby Bury Castle where you will find an Iron Age enclosure dating back to 400 B.C. You then climb to the 308 metres (1,010 ft) high Selworthy Beacon where there are marvellous views across Exmoor and the Somerset coast. It is one of the highest points in the Exmoor National Park along with Dunkery Beacon . From the high point you descend on Folly Combe, returning to the church soon after. If you would like to continue your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Dunkery Beacon . It is the highest point in Exmoor and consists of a beautiful nature reserve with woodland walks. You could also pick up the South West Coast Path and head west along this lovely stretch of coastline towards Bossington Hill and Porlock or east toward Minehead .",
