  "description": "This National Trust owned park in the Cotswolds is the perfect place for a peaceful afternoon stroll. There are miles of easy footpaths taking you through the tranquil wooded valley to the five pretty lakes within the park. The walk also visits the Boat House, built in the early 19th century and the fine Victorian mansion. There's plenty of wildlife in the park too - look out for kingfishers and herons on the ponds and voles and bats in the woodland. The Cotswold Way runs past the park so you could pick up this excellent trail to continue your walk. Also nearby is the town of Nailsworth and the lovely Rodborough Common. The common has miles of good walking trails. It is in an elevated position above Stroud so on a clear day there are far reaching views towards the Forest of Dean and the Welsh hills. Just to the west of the park is the splendid Coaley Peak viewpoint and the adjacent Coaley Woods. Just north of Stroud is Haresfield Beacon with miles of cycling and walking trails.",
