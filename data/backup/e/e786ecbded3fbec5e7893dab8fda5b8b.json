    "description": "This pretty Nottinghamshire village is close to a major historical site and the woodland of Sherwood Forest. The village is also a conservation area with an ancient church, 18th century cottages and the Grade I listed Papplewick Hall. In medieval times the village was the southern gateway to Sherwood Forest. This circular walk from the village uses a section of the Robin Hood Way to visit Newstead Abbey , Normanshill Wood, Harlow Wood, Blidworth and Ravenshead. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Robin Hood Way and follow the waymarked footpath north to Newstead Abbey passing Papplewick Hall on the way. The former Augustinian priory is notable as the former home to Lord Byron. The house is surrounded by acres of parkland, woodland, formal gardens and lakes. The route continues north to Normanshill Wood and Thieves Wood before turning east to pass through Harlow Wood. Here you pass along Rainworth Water and a series of ponds leading to Friar Tuck's Well. You continue south east to Blidworth where you could take a detour from the route to visit Blidworth Woods . This route turns south west towards Ravenshead and Trumper Park. Shortly after you return to Papplewick village.",
