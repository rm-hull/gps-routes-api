  "description": "Follow the waterside path around this reservoir on this easy circular walk in Somerset. There is a good footpath running around the perimeter with parking available at the south eastern end. It's a lovely spot with sailboats on the water and beautiful countryside and woodland surrounding the water. It's about two miles around the reservoir so it makes for a nice afternoon stroll. It's easy to extend your walking in the area with the spectacular Cheddar Gorge and the delightful Strawberry Line route nearby. Just to the west of the reservoir you can climb across Wavering Down on the West Mendip Way and visit the beautiful Crook Peak. From here you can enjoy wonderful views towards the coast and into Wales.",
