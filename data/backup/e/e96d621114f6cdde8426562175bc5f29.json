The lake is a good spot for birdwatching with several species of wildfowl regular visitors to the area. The Etherow Goyt Valley Way and the Goyt Way walking routes run through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk on these trails. Head west along the river trail and you could visit the lovely Chadkirk Country Estate. Here you'll find a wonderful 16th century chapel, a 60 acre farm and a walled garden. You can also pick up the Peak Forest Canal in this area. The address for Etherow park is: George Street, Compstall, Romiley, Stockport SK6 5JD.

The park includes a splendid hill top viewpoint with excellent views over the canal, Greater Manchester and the Pennine Hills. There's also a fine parkside pub for refreshments. Just to the west you could pick up the Peak Forest Canal and enjoy an easy walk along the towpath. Just to the south there's the climb to the Mellor Cross to try. The religous cross marks the site where Methodist John Wesley preached during the 18th century. There are fine views from the elevated position of the site. Just to the east is the pretty little hamlet of Rowarth. Here you will find the Little Mill Inn, a delightful Grade II listed inn set in a former candlewick mill, with a waterwheel in the adjacent stream. The historic mill is well known locally and includes an outdoor area with ducks and geese on the river, chickens roaming free and rabbits in a large outdoor pen. Our walk from the village climbs to the geologically fascinating Cown Edge Rocks and Robin Hood's Picking Rods. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
