The most striking feature is the view over Ladybower Reservoir, with its iconic Y-shaped structure surrounded by woodland and rolling hills. On a clear day, you can also see the Ashopton Viaduct, which spans the reservoir, and the lush green landscape of the Hope Valley stretching into the distance. Looking further afield, the high peaks of the Kinder Scout Plateau and Mam Tor are visible, showcasing the rugged beauty of the Dark Peak area. The village of Bamford lies below, nestled amidst fields and trees, creating a picturesque foreground to the sweeping landscapes beyond."

  "description": "Climb to Bamford Edge on this exhilarating walk in the Peak District. The walk is geologically significant with lots of interesting gritstone rock formations to look out for. From the elevated position of Bamford Edge there are simply wonderful views over the surrounding area. The walk starts from the Derbyshire village of Bamford and climbs on country lanes towards Bole Hill and Bamford Clough. You then head north and pick up the Bamford Edge footpath on Bamford Moor. There are splendid views across the Peak District Hope Valley and down to the lovely Ladybower Reservoir below. The route can be turned into a longer circular walk by continuing to Stanage Edge just east of Bamford Edge. Here you will find a stunning gritstone escarpment of Stanage Edge and the peak of High Neb. From here you can enjoy wonderful views over the Hallam Moors and the Hope Valley. You could also descend to Ladybower Reservoir and enjoy the woodland trails along the water. The Derwent Valley Heritage Way runs past Bamford so this is another option. You could follow the riverside path into Hathersage for example. The walk could also be started from Hathersage following the River Derwent to Bamford and then ascending from there. Just to the west you can enjoy a climb to Win Hill which has some of the best views in the area.",

They are still allowed on public rights of way, but not on the access land to the sides or on footpaths that are not designated as rights of way. Given that there are no rights of way that run under the crag, please do not take dogs climbing with you as this could damage the currently good relationship climbers enjoy with the landowner. The Rest cafe mentioned above is dog friendly with water bowls provided outside for dogs."
