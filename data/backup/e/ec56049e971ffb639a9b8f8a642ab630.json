    "description": "This circular walk visits Leighton and Roundhill Reservoirs before climbing into the surrounding moors for great views back down to the water. You can start the walk from the roadside parking near the bridge and then follow paths along the woodland to Roundhill Reservoir. The route then climbs onto Arnagill Moor, where you will reach a height of over 1200ft. From these high points there are splendid views over the beautiful countryside of Nidderdale. The route then descends through Head Moor before returning to the reservoirs. You could start the walk from nearby Masham if you prefer. Then follow the Ripon Rowel west along the River Burn to the reservoir. The reservoir is located very near to the fascinating Druids Temple . This replica of stonehenge sits on a hill just to the east of the start point for this walk. It's well worth a visit if you have time. The long distance Six Dales Trail also passes the reservoirs. You can pick this up and follow it south across Fountains Earth Moor and visit Gouthwaite Reservoir to extend your exercise. Around here you can also pick up the Nidderdale Way and further explore this lovely area.",
