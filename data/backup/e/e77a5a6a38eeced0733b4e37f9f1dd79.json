  "description": "This walk climbs to the wonderful Ivinghoe Beacon from the splendid Greyhound Inn in the Chilterns village of Aldbury. You'll enjoy some of the finest views in the Chilterns with a great reward of a fine meal at the inn at the end of your walk. You start off at the Greyhound Inn in Aldbury. It's a very pretty village with its nice cottages and duck pond. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north through Aldbury Common which sits on the western side of the popular Ashridge Estate. The walk follows a section of the Ashridge Boundary Trail through the common where there are nice peaceful woodland trails and lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for. At Incombe Hole the route picks up the Icknield Way Path to take you up to Ivinghoe Beacon. The iconic hill stands at 233 m (757 ft) and commands fine views over the Chiltern Hills and the Vale of Aylesbury. The route then heads east to visit Gallows Hill before descending back to the Ashridge Estate. It's easy to extend your walking in this lovely area. You could head east and visit the adjacent Berkhamsted Common. The area is made up of attractive Silver birch woodland and gorsey heath with miles of ancient tracks to follow. The common is part of the wider Ashridge Estate which includes 5,000 acres of woodlands, commons and chalk downland. You can further explore the area on the long distance Ashridge Boundary Trail .",
