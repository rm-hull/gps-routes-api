The broad here is viewed across barleyfield, from Court Road. The village of Rollesby - mentioned in the\u00a0Domesday Book\u00a0as Rotholfuesby and believed to have been a Viking settlement - is situated eight miles northwest of the seaside town of Great Yarmouth. Being isolated from the other Norfolk Broads, Rollesby Broad (linked to Filby and Ormesby Broad) is an ideal place for fishing and sailing as the use of motorised pleasure crafts is not permitted. In 2001 the parish, which for purposes of local government belongs to the district of Great Yarmouth, had a population of 995 in 408 households. St George's church is one of 120-odd round tower churches in Great Britain, most of which can be found in Norfolk."

St George's church has a round tower with an octagonal upper section and dates mainly from the 14th century but there was an extensive restoration during the 19th century and there are not many older survivals. The font is C19, the east window is by Powell & Sons (d. 1922). A C17 monument - to Rose Claxton, who died in 1601 - is located beside the high altar but only the tomb chest and effigy remain. The C17 monument to Leonard Mapes of Beeston (next Norwich), depicting the deceased with his wife and children, was executed in alabaster. A curious cubicle is located in the southeastern corner of the sanctuary; it has two entries and might have served as a sacristy. The church is kept locked but a key is available."

  "description": "This short walk takes you along Ormesby Broad to the village of Ormesby St Michael where you can visit Ormesby Little Broad. At the end of the walk there's also a splendid waterside pub for refreshment. From the start point there's also the option of heading into the nearby village of Rollesby. The walk starts on Rollesby Bridge where there's a public car park. There's also the Waterside Cafe on the western side of the bridge, which offers an alternative start/finish point. You can follow the pavement east along the bridge where there are views to Rollesby Broad to the south and Ormesby Broad to the north. The road will eventually lead you to Ormesby St Michael where you can turn south along a country lane to take you down to Ormesby Little Broad. Here you can enjoy views across the water from the lovely garden area of The Boathouse restaurant. The route returns to the car park on the same paths but you could extend the walk by heading into the village of Rollesby on the western side of the bridge. There's an interesting 14th century church to see here. The broad and village are next to Fleggburgh and Filby Broad where there are more nice trails to try.",
