  "description": "This wonder of engineering was constructed in the early 19th century by Thomas Telford. It is noteworthy as the longest staircase lock flight in Scotland. You can start your walk from the Neptune's Staircase car park next to the Banavie Swing Bridge. You can then pick up a lovely surfaced footpath running along the Caledonian Canal and the locks. After about 10 minutes there's a footbridge where you can cross over and walk along the other side of the canal. It's a very photogenic area with the nearby Ben Nevis making a fine backdrop. You can extend the walk by heading north east along the canal and the Great Glen Way to visit Loch Lochy .",
