It is an aqueduct built under the direction of Sir Hugh Myddleton between 1607 and 1612 to bring fresh drinking water from Chadwell and Amwell Springs near Ware about 40 miles down the Lee Valley to London. In the middle distance is a footbridge carrying a public footpath over the aqueduct, while Bury Green is visible on the horizon."

  "description": "This Hertfordshire based town is a great place to start a walk with miles of varied trails to try. There's riverside and canalside trails, several local lakes, and miles of woodland to explore in the nearby Epping Forest. This circular walk explores the Lee Navigation canal and the River Lee Country Park on the eastern side of the town. The walk starts from the train station where you can directly pick up a shared cycling and walking trail to take you north along the River Lee and a series of pretty lakes. You'll pass the Turnbrook Brook and Turnbrook Marsh before coming to Nazeing Marsh. Here you pick up the Lea Valley Walk and follow the canal path south towards Holyfield. The route then heads through the River Lee Country Park, passing along the Horsemill Stream and Waltham Marsh towards Holdbrook. You then turn north following the waymarked footpath past Cheshunt Marsh, Bowyer's Water and Cheshunt Lake before returning to the train station.",
