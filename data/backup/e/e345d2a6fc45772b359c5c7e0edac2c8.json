The pub next door on the right is the Golden Pheasant."

The original 16th century oak-framed roof was however preserved in the building in its new location. The building is now the home of the Peking Diner and Acorn Estate Agents."

The Crown's history as a coaching inn on the old A1 road through Biggleswade is evidenced by the large and high gate at the far end where the old sign advertising livery and bait for sale has been retained. However the Crown's main claim to fame is that it was the place where the Great Fire of Biggleswade began on 16 June 1785. It was apparently started due to the carelessness of a servant who dumped ashes from the kitchen fire in the hotel yard near some dry straw. The ensuing inferno destroyed nearly a third of Biggleswade. The loss was estimated at \u00a322,500, a fortune at the time. The Crown was however rebuilt and opened again in 1793."

Originally the river flowed through Holme Mills but when the River Ivel Navigation was extended from Biggleswade upstream to Shefford in 1823 a series of locks were built to bypass the various mills. The Navigation was abandoned in 1876 when the competition from the railways made transport by boat uneconomic."
