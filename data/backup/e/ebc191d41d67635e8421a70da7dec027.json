  "description": "This walk takes you from Tiverton to Bickleigh using a section of the Exe Valley Way. This waymarked trail will take you south along the River Exe to the pretty village where you'll find the 18th century Bickleigh Mill and a fine riverside pub. It's about a 4 mile walk from the town centre, along a fairly flat footpath with river views and pockets of peaceful woodland to enjoy. At the site you'll find the 18th century mill with a number of nice shops and eateries. Also nearby are the popular maize mazes and Bickleigh Castle. This fortified manor house stands on the banks of the River Exe. It's Grade I listed with several centuries old buildings to admire. The main building was destroyed during the English Civil War, however other buildings, mostly arranged around a central courtyard survived. The castle is sometimes open to the public, but is mainly booked for weddings. You could extend the walk by continuing south along the trail to the pretty village of Brampford Speke where there's a noteworthy 18th century inn to visit.",
