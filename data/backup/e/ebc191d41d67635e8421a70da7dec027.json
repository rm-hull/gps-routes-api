  "description": "This walk takes you from Tiverton to Bickleigh using a section of the Exe Valley Way. This waymarked trail will take you south along the River Exe to the pretty village where you'll find the 18th century Bickleigh Mill and a fine riverside pub. It's about a 4 mile walk from the town centre, along a fairly flat footpath with river views and pockets of peaceful woodland to enjoy. At the site you'll find the 18th century mill with a number of nice shops and eateries. Also nearby are the popular maize mazes and Bickleigh Castle. This fortified manor house stands on the banks of the River Exe. It's Grade I listed with several centuries old buildings to admire. The main building was destroyed during the English Civil War, however other buildings, mostly arranged around a central courtyard survived. The castle is sometimes open to the public, but is mainly booked for weddings. You could extend the walk by continuing south along the trail to the pretty village of Brampford Speke where there's a noteworthy 18th century inn to visit.",

It's a special place with a fabulous thatched roof, chimneys, and tall windows. There's a smashing beer garden right next to the water where you can relax on warmer days. The idyllic inn does very good food and is also dog friendly if you have your four legged friend with you. You can find it in the village at postcode EX16 8RW for you sat navs."

There's also the Exeter Canal Walk, the Exeter Green Circle and the Exeter Circular Walk to try in nearby Exeter. Just a few miles north east of the city there's the wonderful Killerton Park Estate to explore. The National Trust owned park covers thousands of acres with miles of great cycling and walking trails surrounding the 18th century mansion. The historic village of Broadclyst and the peaceful woodland trails around Ashclyst Forest can also be found in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
