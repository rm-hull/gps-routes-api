  "description": "Explore these stunning, colourful gardens located in Windsor Great Park. There are 250 acres of landscaped gardens and woodlands to explore using a series of well defined walking trails. One of the main highlights on the walk is the amazing Punch Bowl. This area of the gardens contains numerous multi-coloured azaleas, exploding into a riot of colour in the springtime. Other plants/trees include Magnolia, Mahonia, Pernettya, Rhododendron Species, Glenn Dale azaleas, hardy ferns, Ilex and Dwarf conifers. This walk starts at the eastern end of the gardens next to the car park. You then pass the 100 foot high totem pole and the Wick Pond as you head to High Flyer's Hill. You return passing the Polo grounds where you may be able to watch a match. You then pass the pretty Obelisk pond before returning to the start point. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Virginia Water Lake where you'll find a delightful lakeside trail.",
