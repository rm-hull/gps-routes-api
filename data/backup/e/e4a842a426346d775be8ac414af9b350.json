  "description": "This Hertfordshire based village lies just to the south west of Hertford. The attractive village is known for the Grade II listed Stratton's Tower, an excellently preserved five-storey observatory dating to 1789. There's also Little Berkhamsted House an 18th century house notable for its stately Greek Dorich porch. This circular walk from the village uses part of the Hertfordshire Chain Walk to explore the villages, countryside and woodland surrounding Little Berkhamsted. The route starts in the village and heads east to the neighbouring village of Bayford. You then head south passing Gidner's Wood and Blackfan Wood. Just before Newgate Street you turn west to head past Ponsbourne Park Hotel towards Epping Green. From here you continue north to return to Little Berkhamsted.",
