The remains of the former monastic buildings are more extensive."

  "description": "Visit the fascinating remains of this former Cistercian abbey and enjoy a waterside stroll along the Calder River on this lovely circular walk in the Lancashie village of Whalley. As well as the atmospheric ruins there are delightful grounds and gardens to enjoy. There is also a fine 14th century gatehouse in excellent condition. Just to the west there's also the impressive Whalley Viaduct. Also known as \"Whalley Arches\" the 19th century structure is noteworthy as the longest and largest railway viaduct in Lancashire. The abbey is located by the River Calder so you can extend your walk by heading along the water to the nearby Spring Wood which used to be owned by the abbey monks. Here you will find a splendid nature trail, ancient woodland, ponds, bluebells and wildflowers. Just to the west you will find the interesting village of Ribchester. There's the remains of an old Roman Fort and nice waterside trails along the River Ribble to be found here. The town of Clitheroe is just to the north. The splendid castle and grounds are well worth a visit. If you are coming by train then the abbey is just a short walk from Whalley Railway Station.",
