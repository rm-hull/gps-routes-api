  "description": "This village in Leicestershire has some nice river and canal walks to try. There's also a nearby lake and a fine waterside inn for rest and refreshment after your exercise. This circular walk from the village visits the River Soar, the Grand Union Canal and the neighbouring village of Quorn. The route runs for just under 3 miles with some pleasant waterside footpaths. You can pick up the canal just to the west of the train station. You can extend the walk by following a footpath south from Quorn to visit Swithland Reservoir, Cropston Reservoir and Swithland Woods. These sites are located close to Barrow and are a great place to extend your walking in the area. Near here you'll also find the expansive deer park at the popular Bradgate Country Park .",
