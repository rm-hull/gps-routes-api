  "description": "This 700 acre natural park in Fakenham has miles of nice walking trails to try. There's lots to see with a number of pretty lakes and ponds with waterside trails to enjoy. There's also large areas of woodland, beautiful gardens, water features, wildflower meadows, views of the River Wensum and lots of wildlife to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for Grey-Crowned Cranes, Red Squirrels, Cormorant and Lapwing. To continue your wildlife watching in North Norfolk you could head to the wonderful Holkham National Nature Reserve. Here you'll find 9,600 acres of grazing marsh, woodland, salt marsh, sand dunes and foreshore in England's largest Nature Reserve. To extend your walking in the Fakenham area you could head to Fakenham Common and pick up the riverside path along the River Wensum into the town. There's also countryside trails south of the river which run into the village of Great Ryburgh.",
