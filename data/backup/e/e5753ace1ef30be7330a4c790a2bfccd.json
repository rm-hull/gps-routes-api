  "description": "This walk visits a series of stone cairns on the estate of Balmoral Castle in Deeside. The cairns commemorate members of the British royal family and events in their lives. The circular walk runs for about 5 miles with nice woodland trails and fine views over the Deeside hills from the high points. You can start from the castle itself or from nearby Crathie. The majority of the cairns were erected by Queen Victoria in the 19th century. They commemorate the marriages of Victoria's children, of the Princess Royal (to Frederick, Crown Prince of Prussia in 1858), Prince Albert Edward, Princess Alice, Princess Helena, Princess Louise, Prince Arthur, Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice. The most striking cairn is the large pyramid erected by Victoria in memory of her husband Prince Albert after his death in 1861. In 2012 an additional cairn was erected and unveiled by the Queen to mark her Diamond Jubilee. To continue you walking in the area head south and try the climb to Lochnagar. From the summit of the hill there's fabulous views back down to the Balmoral Estate and over the Cairngorms mountains. The walk starts from the Balmoral Estate Visitor centre where you can also pick up trails around the lovely Loch Muick. Near here there's also mile of fine walking trails in the Corrie Fee Nature Reserve. The reserve is rich with wildlife and also includes beautiful alpine flowers with rare mountain willows clinging to the steep crags of the bowl shaped valley. Before you go please check the Balmoral Estate website for the best times to visit as it's not advised to do the walk when the the royal family is in residence.",

      "content": "\"A unique piece of history in a scenic setting!\" Visited July 2023 5 stars By Alice M. \"The Balmoral Cairns walk is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before. Each cairn is dedicated to different members of the royal family, and the Prince Albert\u2019s Pyramid is absolutely massive! The trails are well-kept and offer beautiful views of the surrounding Deeside hills. It\u2019s a lovely mix of history, nature, and peaceful scenery \u2013 definitely worth the hike!\" \"A tranquil walk with royal connections\" Visited September 2023 4.5 stars By Tom L. \"This walk offers a fascinating glimpse into royal history while being completely immersed in nature. The cairns themselves are impressive, but the real highlight is the view from the Prince Albert\u2019s Pyramid at the top. The whole walk took us around two hours with stops for photos and some lovely forest paths. It\u2019s a hidden gem in Royal Deeside!\" \"A peaceful and picturesque hike\" Visited May 2023 5 stars By Sarah J. \"I didn\u2019t know what to expect from the Balmoral Cairns, but it was such a peaceful and unique hike! Each cairn has its own character, and the paths through the forest are enchanting. The pyramid for Prince Albert is especially striking and has amazing views from the top. It\u2019s quiet, scenic, and great for anyone interested in history or the outdoors.\" \"Beautiful landscapes with a touch of history\" Visited October 2022 4 stars By Michael W. \"We decided to explore the Balmoral Cairns during a trip to Deeside, and it was a wonderful experience. The cairns are interesting monuments, and the walk through woodlands and open fields is beautiful, particularly in autumn when the leaves are changing. Prince Albert\u2019s Pyramid is the highlight \u2013 make sure you save energy for the final climb up to it!\" \"A great walk with views over Royal Deeside\" Visited June 2023 5 stars By Lucy P. \"This is a lovely, quiet walk that leads you up to various royal cairns before reaching the impressive Prince Albert\u2019s Pyramid. The views over Deeside are stunning, especially on a clear day. There\u2019s a peaceful feeling to the whole area, and it\u2019s a nice change from busier tourist spots. Highly recommend bringing a picnic to enjoy along the way!\" \"Hidden history and stunning scenery\" Visited April 2023 4.5 stars By Andrew S. \"I didn\u2019t realise how many cairns there were on this walk! Each one represents a piece of royal history, and the pyramid cairn is truly impressive. The trails are manageable, though some parts are steep. The view from the top of Prince Albert\u2019s Pyramid made the climb worth it \u2013 you can see right across the valley. A fantastic hike with an interesting backstory!\""
