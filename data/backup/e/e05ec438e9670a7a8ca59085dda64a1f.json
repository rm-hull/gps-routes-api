  "description": "Explore 92 acres of landscaped early eighteenth-century garden in this lovely walk in Silsoe. Stroll along the wide gravel central walk, past the long canal and then on to the Baroque style pavilion. The gardens were landscaped by Lancelot 'Capability' Brown in the 18th century. He added canals around the park boundaries, woodland and the central canal. The grounds also include a Bath House with a thatched roof and cobbled floor, ornate marble fountains, a Chinese Temple with bridge and over 40 statues. The Grade I listed house has a fantastic interactive exhibition which tells the story of Wrest Park. The beautiful conservatory then leads you out to the Italian Garden, Rose Garden and French Parterre Garden. Wrest Park is located about 7 miles west of Letchworth, near Flitwick and Ampthill .",
