  "description": "This walk takes you to the picturesque Rutter Force waterfall from the village of Appleby in Westmorland. It's about a 3 mile walk, following the pretty Hoff Beck from the settlement to the falls. The walk starts on the southern side of the village where you can pick up the Dales High Way heading south towards the Hoff Beck. You can then follow the beck south towards Hoff before coming to the waterfall of Rutter Force. It's a lovely scenic spot with the rushing falls positioned next to the photogenic old Rutter Mill and the ford. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the popular Appleby Riverside Walk. Here you can visit the 12th century Appleby Castle and enjoy more splendid views over the River Eden Valley.",

To the south there's the village of Great Asby where you can try the climb to Great Asby Scar. The area has been designated as a national nature reserve and includes a wonderful stretch of limestone pavement with extensive views towards the Lake District fells."
