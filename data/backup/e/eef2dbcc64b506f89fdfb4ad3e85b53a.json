    "description": "This attractive Hampshire village is located in the Hart District of the county. The historic settlement includes a number of listed buildings including a noteworthy Norman church and a 500 year old pub. It's also located close to the North Downs and the Basingstoke Canal, both of which provide good walking opportunities. This walk from the village follows country lanes west to visit Odiham Castle near the neighbouring village of Odiham. After exploring the picturesque ruins of the 13th century castle you can also up a section of the Basingstoke Canal and enjoy a waterside stroll to Dogmersfield Park. Here there's nice trails along Dogmersfield Lake and lots of woodland paths to explore.",
