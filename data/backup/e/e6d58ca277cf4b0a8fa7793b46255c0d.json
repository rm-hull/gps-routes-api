  "description": "This town in the Scottish Borders is a fine place for walkers with an historic abbey, riverside trails and nearby hill climbs to enjoy. This circular walk from the town uses sections of the Borders Abbeys Way and the St Cuthbert's Way to visit the Eildon Hills and Dryburgh Abbey. There's some fascinating historical sites, great views from the high points and easy riverside trails to enjoy on the varied walk. The walk starts in the town at the historic Melrose Abbey. The abbey was founded in 1136 as the first Cistercian monastery in Scotland. You can explore the atmospheric ruins and find out more about the history in the associated museum. At the abbey you can pick up St Cuthbert's Way and follow the waymarked footpath south into the Eildon Hills. You'll pass the 422 metre high Eildon Mid Hill before passing through Broad Wood and arriving at Bowden. Here the path turns east to take you through Newton St Boswells where you cross the River Tweed. A riverside path heading south will then take you to Dryburgh Abbey. It's a very picturesque spot with the remarkably complete medieval ruin located by the River Tweed. Retrace your steps to Newton St Boswells and you can pick up the Borders Abbeys Way and follow it north through Eildon to the Eildontree Stone. Shortly after you arrive back in Melrose.",

      "content": "Head south from the town to visit nearby Jedburgh and explore the 12th century abbey ruins and enjoy a stroll alond the Jed Water river. On the way you will pass Harestanes where you can climb to the Waterloo Monument on Peniel Heugh hill and enjoy some fine views of the area. The Georgian Monteviot House and Gardens is also located in this area. Just to the south west of Harestanes there's Fatlips Castle where you can enjoy a climb to a splendid 16th century peel tower and enjoy more wonderful views over Teviotdale. For cyclists the 4 Abbeys Cycle Route passes through the area. The circular trail uses a series of quiet country lanes to visit the same 4 abbeys as the Borders Abbey Way. Most of the route is also suitable for walkers. Just to the east of the town there's the climb to Scott's View to try. The viewpoint is named after Sir Walter Scott, author of novels such as Ivanhoe and Rob Roy. From here you can enjoy some wonderful views over the town and the surrounding hills and countryside."
