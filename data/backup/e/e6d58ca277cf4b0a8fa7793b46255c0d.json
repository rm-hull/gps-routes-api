  "description": "This town in the Scottish Borders is a fine place for walkers with an historic abbey, riverside trails and nearby hill climbs to enjoy. This circular walk from the town uses sections of the Borders Abbeys Way and the St Cuthbert's Way to visit the Eildon Hills and Dryburgh Abbey . There's some fascinating historical sites, great views from the high points and easy riverside trails to enjoy on the varied walk. The walk starts in the town at the historic Melrose Abbey . The abbey was founded in 1136 as the first Cistercian monastery in Scotland. You can explore the atmospheric ruins and find out more about the history in the associated museum. At the abbey you can pick up St Cuthbert's Way and follow the waymarked footpath south into the Eildon Hills. You'll pass the 422 metre high Eildon Mid Hill before passing through Broad Wood and arriving at Bowden. Here the path turns east to take you through Newton St Boswells where you cross the River Tweed. A riverside path heading south will then take you to Dryburgh Abbey. It's a very picturesque spot with the remarkably complete medieval ruin located by the River Tweed. Retrace your steps to Newton St Boswells and you can pick up the Borders Abbeys Way and follow it north through Eildon to the Eildontree Stone. Shortly after you arrive back in Melrose.",
