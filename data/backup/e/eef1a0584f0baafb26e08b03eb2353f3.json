This is the south-east corner of the MoD-owned land of Havengore Island viewed looking across Havengore Creek from the public footpath near Haven Point. The creek is part of the complex of watercourses on the south side of the River Roach that separate Foulness Island and Havengore Island from the mainland. The creek, but not the island, forms part of the Foulness SSSI."

The reserve consisting of more than 200 hectares of fresh and salt-water lagoons, salt marsh and scrub was acquired by the RSPB in 2001. The pools are the result of clay extraction. There are a number of rights of way across the reserve so there is easy access for the public. The picture was taken from a viewpoint constructed for birdwatchers with powerful binoculars!"

The red and white beacon on the left is a mudflat warning beacon in the River Thames. The now-disused artillery fort was built in the 1860s to guard the entrance to the Thames from seaborne attack. The surviving fragments of the fort and the area around it are part of a nature reserve and can be visited by the public."
