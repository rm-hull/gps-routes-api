  "description": "This walk explores the Gorhambury Estate in St Albans in Hertfordshire. You can walk through the estate along the Gorhambury Drive which is normally open between 8am and 6pm. The permissive paths lead from Bluehouse Hill, Beech Tree Lane and Redbourn Road. This walk starts from Verulamium Park where you can see the ancient Roman Theatre before following the drive around the estate. This opening section uses part of the Hertfordshire Way and the Ver-Colne Valley Walk to take you past the roman site and then into Gorhambury. There's lovely views across the estate's fields with sheep and horses to see also. The drive then bends round taking you past Gorhambury House before coming to Old Gorhambury House which is now a ruin. It was once an immense mansion constructed in 1563-8 by the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Nicholas Bacon. It was visited a number of times by Queen Elizabeth I and  is a Grade I listed building. The more modern house is a Palladian-style mansion built between 1777 and 1784 to replace Old Gorhambury House. The building is currently the home of the 7th Earl of Verulam.",
