There are however plans to reinstate the canal using probably part of the Rother, making it possible once again to get from the Trent via Worksop to Chesterfield town centre. This picture shows the route of the canal as it crossed Bridge Street in Killamarsh, the canal running roughly east - west."

  "description": "This Derbyshire town has some nice trails to follow along the River Rother and around the historic Renishaw Hall. This walk from the town visits one of the highlights of the area at Rother Valley Country Park. The walk starts in the town and heads east to Chapelwheel Dam and the disused section of the Chesterfield Canal. Here you can pick up the Trans Pennine Trail and follow it north along a dismantled railway line which can be used by both walkers and cyclists. This will take you to Rother Valley Park where you can enjoy a circular walk around the lovely large lake. The route then heads south passing Nethermoor Lake, Sheepcote Hill, Killamarsh, and Netherthorpe before picking up the Trans Pennine Trail again and following back towards Eckington.",
