  "description": "This is a circular cycle ride on the quiet roads and country lanes surrounding this large reservoir near Colchester , Essex. Abberton is the\u00a0fourth largest\u00a0reservoir in England with an area of nearly 5 square kilometres (1,200 acres). The route starts at the visitor centre and takes you to Great Wigborough, Peldon and Malting Green. This route is designed for cyclists but walkers can enjoy walks from the visitor centre at the start of this route. The reservoir is excellent for bird watching with thousands of wildlfowl to look out for on the water. These include Wigeon, Teal, Mallard, Pochard, Tufted Duck, Coot and Black-headed Gull which can be spotted from the three bird hides. The visitor centre also has a wealth of information on the wildlife you can expect to see in this lovely wetlands area. If you'd like to extend your walking in the area then you could head south and visit the lovely Mersea Island . The round the island circular walk visits  a number of nice beaches and the pretty Cudmore Grove Country Park .",
