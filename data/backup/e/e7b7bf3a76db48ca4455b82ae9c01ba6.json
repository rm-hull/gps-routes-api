  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle along the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal from the city centre of Birmingham to the town of Fazeley in Staffordshire. Along the way there's lots of pretty locks, old bridges, nature reserves and wildlife to look out for. You start off at Old Turn Junction\u00a0near the\u00a0National Indoor Arena in Birmingham and head through Aston and Tyburn where you pass close to Pype Hayes Park . The large park has 100 acres to explore with a lake, ornamental gardens and woodland. It's just north of the canal at Tyburn and worth a short detour. Just next to the park there is the pretty Plantsbrook Nature Reserve which consists of open water, wetland, woodland and meadow. You leave the city and head through Minworth and Cudworth before coming to the splendid Kingsbury Water Park . The 600 acre country park is a major highlight on the route. It consists of 15 lakes with miles of good cycling and walking trails to try. The final section takes you from Kingsbury Water Park to the town of Fazeley near Tamworth . On the way you'll pass Middleton Lakes RSPB reserve\u00a0with 400 acres to explore. It's a great place for wildlife watching with common pochard,\u00a0tufted duck\u00a0and\u00a0smew to look out for. At Fazeley you have the option of continuing along the canal towards Whittington and Lichfield . This section passes Hopwas Woods which is good for mountain biking. National Cycle Network route 535 runs through Aston so this is the best section for those on a bike.",
