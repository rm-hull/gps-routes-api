  "description": "Visit this National Trust owned manor house and enjoy walks around the grounds and the surrounding countryside. The house is located close to Somerton, Kingsdon and Charlton Adam. The gardens are very pretty with well surfaced paths taking you to attractive topiary and ponds with ornate statues. They are open from March to October. A few miles south of the estate you can pick up the Monarch's Way and the Leland Trail near Ilchester. Here you can enjoy a waterside walk along the River Yeo to Yeovilton.",

      "content": "At the site there's a fine tea room for some post walk refreshments. There's a good range of meals and snacks and a courtyard area to sit out in. If you fancy a pub lunch then head west of the house to the little village of Kingsdon where you can visit the delightful Kingsdon Inn. The picturesque thatched pub has a 300 year old history and a fine menu. There's a charming interior with a cosy fire for colder days. Outside there's a lovely garden area to relax in during the summer months. You can find them at a postcode of TA11 7LG for your sat navs."

      "content": "If you head west along the Macmillan Way west you can pick up the Langport Walk. This will take you around the market town before following a riverside path to the historic ruins of Muchelney Abbey. The abbey is run by English Heritage and has a fascinating history having once been a wealthy Benedictine house and the second oldest religious foundation in Somerset. It's another worthy local piece of history to investigate in the area. The Somerton Walk starts from the nearby town and visits the site using country trails. It also visits the nearby villages of Kingsdon and Charlton Adam. The town itself is also well worth exploring with its picturesque 17th century market square and some fine local architecture. To the north west in Street there's another National Trust owned area at Walton Hill to explore. Here you can also pick up the Polden Way and explore the Polden Hills. Just to the north of Somerton you'll find the neighbouring village of Compton Dundon where you can try the Compton Dundon and Combe Hill Wood Walk. The circular walk includes a climb to Iron Age Hillfort on Dundon Beacon and a visit to the Hood Monument, which is something of a historic local landmark. For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks page."
