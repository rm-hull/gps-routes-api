  "description": "Visit this National Trust owned manor house and enjoy walks around the grounds and the surrounding countryside. The house is located close to Somerton , Kingsdon and Charlton Adam. The gardens are very pretty with well surfaced paths taking you to attractive topiary and ponds with ornate statues. They are open from March to October. A few miles south of the estate you can pick up the Monarch's Way and the Leland Trail near Ilchester. Here you can enjoy a waterside walk along the River Yeo to Yeovilton.",
