There's a large lake, deer park and nice trails along the River Avon here. You can reach the park from the nearby village of Wellesbourne on the Wellesbourne Walk. It's about a 2 mile walk from the village, running along the River Dene. You can also visit the village's historic watermill beforehand. Just to the east is Gaydon where you can visit the British Motor Museum. The noteworthy museum houses one of the largest collections of historic British cars in the world. Just to the south west there's Ettington Park to explore. Here you'll find a Grade I listed Victorian mansion surrounded by 40 acres of lovely parkland with well laid out gardens, an Orangery, an ancient Norman Chapel and views of the River Stour. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
