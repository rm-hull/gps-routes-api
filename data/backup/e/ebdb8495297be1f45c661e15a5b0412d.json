There are also boatyards at Crosshaven and two other marinas. There is another marina on Great Island opposite East Ferry, while Monkstown and Blackrock are used for boating, canoeing, windsurfing and jet-skiing. A number of rowing clubs have facilities on the part of the River Lee between Cork city and Blackrock."

  "description": "This circular walk explores some of the quieter and more scenic areas of the city of Cork. You'll pass along waterside paths on the River Lee and visit the Marina Park on Cork's historic Marina. There's also more interesting local history to enjoy at the 16th century Blackrock Castle where you'll find a visitor centre and a cafe for refreshments. After exploring the castle, follow the riverside paths towards Jacob\u2019s Island and Joe McHugh Park, where you'll soon spot the Passage Railway Greenway across the Tramore River. The Greenway then takes you through Mahon and back to the Marina. This greenway is a shared-use path that links Cork City with Passage West, tracing the route of an old railway that ceased operation in 1932. Some of the route is also open to cyclists including the surfaced greenway. To continue your walking around Cork head north west to visit Blarney Castle. The ancient castle is surrounded by some beautiful grounds and gardens with miles of footpaths to enjoy.",

This marina offers a convenient pontoon berth, specially designed to welcome leisure vessels into the historic and nationally significant heart of Cork. Upon docking at the marina, visitors are immediately plunged into the rich maritime heritage of Cork, which includes being the location of the world\u2019s oldest yacht club, established in 1720. Cork\u2019s narrative is deeply rooted in its status as one of the premier natural harbours globally, with a history that spans worldwide. The Port\u2019s Coat of Arms, \u201cStatio Bene Fida Carinis\u201d (Safe Harbour for Ships), encapsulates this legacy. A visit to Cork Harbour provides access to numerous notable heritage sites linked to the city\u2019s maritime past, all accessible to those arriving by boat."
