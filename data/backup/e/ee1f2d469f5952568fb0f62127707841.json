  "description": "A walk through the River Teme valley from Worcester to Knightwick. The walk starts on Worcester Bridge in the centre of Worcester and heads south along the Severn Way to Lower Wick where the River Teme meets the River Severn. You then head west along the river to Upper Wick, Bransford, Leigh and Broadwas before finishing at the village of Knightwick in the Malvern Hills. The route is fairly flat with a few moderate climbs along the way. There's lovely views of the surrounding Worcestershire countryside and the river. At Knightwick you can enjoy a climb to Ankerdine Hill and Hay Wood. You can also pick up the Worcestershire Way and head further into the Malvern Hills.",
