  "description": "This small Yorkshire village sits a few miles south of York on the River Ouse. This circular walk from the village takes you along the river to visit neighbouring Bishopthorpe. You can follow a pleasant riverside footpath north before linking up with the York to Selby Railway Path to take you into Bishopthorpe. The shared cycling and walking trail is a nice way of further exploring the area on a good surfaced path. Atfer exploring the village of Bishopthorpe you can then return south along a public footpath with some nice views of the surrounding countryside. To extend the walk head to the opposite side of the river where you can visit the pretty village of Naburn and the picturesque Naburn Locks. There's riverside paths, a nature trail and a sensory garden to explore in this scenic area.",
