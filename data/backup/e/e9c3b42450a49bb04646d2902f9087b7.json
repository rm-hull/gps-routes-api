  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this popular park in Liverpool. There's 235 acres to explore with a series of lakes, a splendid palm house, attractive gardens and a number of sculptures of well known historical figures. Other highlights in the park include the fairy glen with caves, pretty waterfalls and an Aviary viewing point. There's also the Grade I listed Shaftesbury Memorial and Eros Fountain and a nice lakeside cafe. The Palm House is partiuclarly impressive, housing the Liverpool Botanical Collection with a variety of palm trees, orchids and a glasshouse. The Trans Pennine Trail runs right through the park. Cyclists are permitted on this section. You can pick up the trail and follow it west to visit the nearby Princes Park. Continuing west take you into Liverpool where you can try our long circular walk which visits Albert Dock and the Liverpool Festival Gardens. If you follow the Trans Pennine Trail east it will take you to Calderstones Park. It's only about a mile away and includes nearly 100 acres of parkland with woodland, lake and beautiful Japanese and old English gardens. Using the google street view below you can virtually explore the park!",
