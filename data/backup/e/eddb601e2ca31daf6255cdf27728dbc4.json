  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around Hawley Lake on this easy walk in Hart, Hampshire. You can start the walk from the Sail Training Centre on the northern side of the water. Trails then take you all the way round the lake, passing through the woodland of Hawley Woods. It's a lovely peaceful spot with nice views over the lake through the trees and lots of water loving wildlife to look out for on the water. The walk is just over 2 miles, taking place on generally good footpaths so it's ideal for an afternoon stroll. Please note the surrounding area of Hawley Common is a MOD Training Area so please abide by the safety notices. You can easily extend your walk by heading north to Yately Common Country Park. Here you'll find 500 acres of heathlands, woodlands and ponds to explore. Just to the east you can pick up the long distance Blackwater Valley Footpath and visit the lakes and wildlife at Frimley Hatches Nature Reserve near Farnborough. In nearby Fleet there is another lakeside walk to try at Fleet Pond. Here you will find Hampshire's largest lake which is also a peaceful nature reserve and a great place for wildlife spotting.",
