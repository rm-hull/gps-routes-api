  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Chesterfield Canal from Worksop to Kiveton Park. The walk runs for just under 6 miles along the flat towpath, with the option of catching the train back at the end of the route. The walk starts on the bridge over the canal just to the south of Worksop train station. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it west past Sandhill Lake to Shireoaks where there's a prety marina. Here you can take a short detour from the canal to visit the 17th century Shireoaks Hall which is just to the south of the marina. Near here you could also stop for refreshments at the Hewett Arms pub in the village. The pub is situated on the outskirts of the village close to a fishing lake\u00a0and includes a nice beer garden. After passing Shireoaks the route continues west past a series of woods before coming to Kiveton Park. Here you can catch the train back to Worksop. You could extend the walk by continuing along the canal to Rother Valley Country Park where there's some nice trails around the pretty lakes. Harthill Reservoir and Pebley Reservoir are also located just east of here. Just to the south of Worksop there's the wonderful Clumber Park . There's 3,800 acres of woodland, open heath and rolling farmland to explore here.",
