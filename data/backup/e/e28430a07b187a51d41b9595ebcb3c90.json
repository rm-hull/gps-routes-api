  "description": "Explore acres of historic parkland in this country park in Doncaster. The estate surrounds the Grade I listed Cusworth Hall and includes lakes, plantations and pleasure ground with dramatic views across the town. In the park there is an Italianate Chapel with beautiful ceiling paintings and an excellent museum with a collection of 36000 objects including accessories, toys and games and kitchen equipment. Look out for watervoles, kingfishers and green flowered heleborine orchids at the delightful lake. The Trans Pennine Trail runs just past the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along the River Don to Conisbrough.",
