He also added the turreted outer gateway which was inhabited until 1920."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the Norfolk village of Baconsthorpe, visiting the historic Baconsthorpe Castle. The walk starts at the castle which lies just to the north of the village. You can then follow footpaths around the photogenic castle ruins which includes a pretty lake. After exploring the site you can then head south through the countryside to visit the village. Part of the route uses a section of the Holt-Mannington Walk a long distance circular trail running through the area. You could extend your outing by picking up the waymarked trail and following it south to visit Mannington Hall. The hall is another local historic highlight and includes some beautiful gardens. Heading north will take you to the peaceful woodland trails at Holt Country Park .",
