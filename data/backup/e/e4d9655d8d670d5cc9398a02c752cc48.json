  "description": "The village of Longnor is based in a lovely part of the Staffordshire Peak District. This circular walk visits some of the highlights of the area including the River Manifold, the River Dove and the prominent hill of High Wheeldon . There's some gorgeous rolling countryside and fine, far reaching views from the high points to enjoy. The walk starts in the village centre and follows Green Lane north east towards High Wheeldon, crossing the River Dove on the way. The distinctive dome-shaped hill sits close to the Staffordshire border in Derbyshire, in the valley of Upper Dovedale, overlooking the villages of Earl Sterndale, Longnor and Crowdecote . From the 422 metre (1387 ft) summit there are wonderful views of the Dove and Manifold valleys. The route then descends south to the village of Crowdecote. Here you cross a pretty section of the River Dove before continuing south toward Under Whitle. The route then turns west towards Over Boothlow before picking up a footpath along the River Manifold to take you back to Longnor. To continue your walking in the area you could head a short distance to the north west and climb Chrome Hill . It's a popular walk which also visits Parkhouse Hill and starts from the nearby village of Earl Sterndale. Three long distance trails also pass close to the village. Just to the east you can pick up the Midshires Way , the Pennine Bridleway and the High Peak Trail to further explore the area.",
