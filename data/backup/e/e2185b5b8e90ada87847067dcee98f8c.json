  "description": "These two lovely coastal towns are connected by this popular walk devised by Teignmouth and Dawlish Ramblers. The walk begins at Teignmouth pier and heads inland through some beautiful countryside and pretty villages before heading back to the coast at Dawlish. The last section returns you to Teignmouth via Holcombe. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Dawlish Sea Wall and head north east to Dawlish Warren. Here you will find a lovely nature reserve on the Exe Estuary with a huge variety of waders to look out for. You can also pick up the Exe Valley Way at Dawlish Warren. Follow it north and it will take you into Exteter along the River Exe and the Exeter Canal .",
