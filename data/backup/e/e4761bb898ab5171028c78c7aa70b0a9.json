  "description": "This walk takes you along a lovely stretch of coast on the Roseland Peninsula in Cornwall. It's about a 2.5 mile walk from the town of St Mawes to the village of St Just, with splendid views over Carrick Roads. The walk starts from St Mawes Castle. The artillery fort was constructed by Henry VIII between 1540 and 1542. It's an impressive sight with grounds stretching down to the waters of the Fal Estuary and great views across to Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. After exploring the castle you follow the coast path north to St Just in Roseland. The little village is well know for its 13th-century church and beautiful riverside gardens. To extend your walking in the area you can visit St Anthony Head Lighthouse and enjoy lovely views back towards St Mawes. Also nearby is the popular town of Falmouth where you can enjoy another great coastal walk to  Pendennis Castle and the lovely Swanpool Nature Reserve. You can catch a regular ferry from St Mawes to Falmouth in the summer months. The long distance South West Coast Path also runs through the area.",
