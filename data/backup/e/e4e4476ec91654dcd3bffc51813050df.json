  "description": "This walk takes you along the Dingwall Canal in the town of Dingwall in the Highlands. It's a fine place for an easy stroll with some splendid coastal views at the end of the walk. The walk starts from Pefferside Park where there is a car parking area and views of the River Peffery which runs along the eastern side of the park. From here you can pick up trails heading east through the park to link up with the canal. Follow the canal east and it leads you to the Ferry Point park on the Cromarty Firth. In the park there's a picnic area and some wonderful views over the Firth to enjoy.",
