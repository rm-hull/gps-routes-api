  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll around these delightful National Trust owned gardens near Penzance. Well laid out footpaths take you to a series of beautiful walled gardens, tranquil ponds and lawns. Other features include a wonderful collection of magnolias and rhododendrons, woodland trails, pretty streams and a kitchen garden. There are also splendid views of the surrounding farmland and towards the coast with Mount's Bay and The Lizard visible on a clear day. A must see is the wonderful lantern walk when the garden takes on a magical atmosphere with the lower drive and walled gardens lined with flaming bamboo torches. You can extend your walking in the area by heading to Penzance and picking up the South West Coast Path. Our Penzance to Mousehole Walk will take you to the delightful fishing village of Mousehole with its beautiful harbour and sandy beach. You can virtually explore the gardens using the google street view link below!",
