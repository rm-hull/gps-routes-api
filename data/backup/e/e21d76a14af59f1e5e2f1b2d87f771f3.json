  "description": "This circular walk takes you to the Chaddesley Wood nature reserve from the village of Chaddesley Corbett in the Wyre Forest District of Worcestershire. The attractive coniferous woodland is covered in pretty bluebells in the spring. There's also streams, ponds and a variety of wildflowers in the summer. Look out for wildlife including woodcock, chiffchaff, crossbill and blackcap. You can park in the village of Chaddesley Corbett to start your walk. Then follow footpaths east through the countryside to the woods. It's about a one mile walk from the village. You can continue your walk in the adjacent Nutnells Wood at Woodcote Green along the waymarked Royal Hunters Forest Walks. The Monarch's Way long distance footpath runs right through Chaddesley Corbett so you could pick this up to continue your walk. If you follow it west you will pass the moated medieval and Elizabethan manor house of Harvington Hall. If you head a few miles north you can visit a number of excellent country parks with good walking trails. These include Lickey Hills Country Park, Clent Hills Country Park and Waseley Hills Country Park. They all have climbs to viewpoints with great views over the surrounding countryside and hills.",
