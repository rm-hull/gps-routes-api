  "description": "This walk explores the lakes, canal and river surrounding the West Berkshire village of Theale. The village is located just to the west of Reading and includes pleasant footpaths along the River Kennet and the Kennet and Avon Canal. This walk from Theale Railway station takes you east along the canal towards Burghfield. You'll pass pretty locks, lakes formed from former gravel pits and a weir on the River Kennet. There's also an optional detour to visit Hosehill Lake Local Nature Reserve where there is a one mile circular walk around the lake. The reserve is a great place for wildlife watching with wildfowl on the water and a butterfly meadow to enjoy. To continue your walking in the area you could head south to visit Burghfield and Wokefield Common where there's a network of good footpaths to try.",
