  "description": "Visit this fascinating replica of Stonehenge, on this lovely circular walk from Masham. The unusual folly is one of the local highlights and with a series of pleasant footpaths around the site it is a popular destination for walkers. The walk starts in the market town of Masham in the Harrogate district of North Yorkshire. The attractive town has some fine Georgian architecture and has some nice riverside footpaths along the River Ure and River Burn. From the town you head west along the Ripon Rowel long distance trail. It will take you towards Micklebury Hill and across Fearby Moor, with nice views of the River Burn. The route then climbs on to the wooded area where you will find the Druids Temple structure. It was built in about 1820 by William Danby of nearby Swinton Park. The site includes a large stone table, a sheltered cave, and an altar stone. It became a folly of national reputation and is still an impressive sight.  Situated at over 800ft there are great views over Wensleydale from the Druid's Plantation surrounding the folly. After exploring the folly and the woodland, the walk then descends to High Knowle and the pretty Sole Beck before picking up the Ripon Rowel to take you back to Masham. To extend the walk you could continue west and visit Leighton Reservoir and Roundhill Reservoir. There's some nice trails along the water and up into the surrounding moorland. Around here you can also pick up the Six Dales Trail .",
