  "description": "Explore the parkland and woodland surrounding this Neo-Grecian house in Dinton, Salisbury. There are good footpaths running past a pretty lake with some woodland paths as well. There are also great views across the Wiltshire countryside toward Salisbury Cathedral. To extend your walking in the area you could head a few miles west and enjoy a circular walk around the lovely Fonthill Estate. The estate has nice footpaths with pockets of woodland and a large lake. Old Wardour Castle is also nearby, located just to the south of Tisbury. There's some nice footpaths to follow around the woods and countryside surrounding the 14th century castle. Tisbury village is also a nice place for a stroll with quaint old cottages, a 12th century parish church, an ancient yew tree and a Grade I listed Tithe Barn to see.",
