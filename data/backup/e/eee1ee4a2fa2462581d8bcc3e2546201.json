  "description": "Enjoy woodland, wildlife meadows and two pretty lakes in this 300 acre country park near Worksop. The walk starts at the car park and takes you along Langold Lake and through Dyscarr Woods before returning to the start point. There's also plenty of wildlife to see with the park designated as a Local Nature Reserve. The park is great for children with a play area and water park for them to splash about in. The park is located a few miles north of Worksop where you can continue your walking along the Chesterfield Canal .",
