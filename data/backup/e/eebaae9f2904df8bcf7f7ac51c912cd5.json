  "description": "This circular walk explores a beautiful part of Achill Island in County Mayo. The waymarked trail follows the Valley Loop around the north eastern part of the island for a distance of about 8.5km. It's a fairly flat hike with wonderful views over the Atlantic Ocean and the nearby Slievemore mountain. There's also a nice sandy beach and a series of pretty lakes. You can continue your walking on the island by heading west to the Dooagh Loop Walk. There's more great views over the horseshoe-shaped Keem Bay, the Dingle peninsula and the surrounding Achill mountains on this trail.",
