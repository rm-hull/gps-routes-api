  "description": "These woods near Coventry have a network of good footpaths to follow around the 178 acre site. Since 1981 the site has been maintained and improved by voluntary workers from the Friends of Brandon Wood and is now reverting to natural broad-leaved woodland. The site is great for flora and fauna with over 330 plant species and more than 50 species of tree. Look out for pretty wildflowers including lesser celandine, wood anemone, primrose, bluebell, ragged robin, bee and spotted orchids, germander speedwell and birdsfoot trefoil. Also keep your eyes peeled for wildlife including Muntjac deer, buzzard, sparrowhawk, kestrel and great spotted woodpeckers. The woods are located in the subarban village of Binley Woods. You can access them from Craven Avenue or you could park at the nearby Brandon Marsh Nature Reserve. The reserve is located just to the south of the woods and a great place to extend your walk. About a mile to the north you will find Coombe Country Park where there's 500 acres of beautiful gardens, woodland and lakes, with splendid views of Coombe Abbey. The Coventry Way, Shakespeare's Avon Way and the Warwickshire Centenary Way long distance trails all pass to the south of the woods. They are a great way of exploring the Warickshire countryside on foot.",

      "content": "To the west of Coventry there's the villages of Berkswell, Hampton in Arden and Balsall Common to visit. The former is particularly noteworthy with its Norman church, Grade II listed 16th century inn and the Berkswell Windmill which dates back to 1826. The epic Heart of England Way can also be picked up in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
