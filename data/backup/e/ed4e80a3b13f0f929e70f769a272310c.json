    "description": "This large area of heathland and woodland has public footpaths to follow from the hamlet of Conford in the north eastern part of the site. It is a significant area with a diversity of habitats supporting twelve known native species of reptiles and amphibians.  Scenery includes oak-birch woodland, conifer plantations, open sandy heaths, and rough grazed pastures. There's lots of interesting plants and flowers to look out for. Also keep your eyes peeled for birds such as Dartford warbler and European nightjar. N.B The Forest is a Range Danger Area and it is illegal and dangerous to enter when the red flags are flying.  Access is NOT permitted most weekdays between 8am and 4pm and some weekends. The woods are located very close to the large village of Liphook . You could follow footpaths from the village to the site, visiting the viewpoint at Weavers Down and the pretty lakes on the adjacent Foley Estate. The National Trust managed Ludshott Common and Bramshott Common are located just to the east. These are good options if you would like to extend your walking in the area. The Shipwrights Way cycling and walking trail skirts the western edge of the forest. You can pick up the trail and follow it north to Alice Holt Forest or south to Hayling Island and Portsmouth on the coast.",
