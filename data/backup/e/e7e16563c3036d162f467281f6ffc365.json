  "description": "This challenging walk takes you up the 742 m (2,434 ft) high Pap of Glencoe in the Highlands of Scotland. The walk begins at the car park at Lochan to the east of the village of Glencoe. It starts by passing through woodland before beginning the climb along the mountain tracks. It is a steep climb with some muddy sections and some scrambling for the last 100 metres to the summit. However, you will be rewarded with breathtaking views over Glencoe, the Mamores and Loch Leven. If you are looking for a more gentle walk in the area then you could try the Glencoe Lochan Trail which starts from the same car park.",

      "content": "The wonderful Buachaille Etive Mor is located a few miles to the south east and well worth a visit. Further to the east is the remote Corrour Station. The station is notable as the highest mainline railway station in the United Kingdom. From here there is a nice trail to follow to the nearby Loch Ossian. Loch Treig can also be visited in this area. Head north and you could visit the second highest waterfall in Scotland on the Steall Falls Walk. It's a spectacular sight and another scenic highlight of the area. A few miles to the east you'll find the Three Sisters Glencoe Waterfall Walk. There's a car park and viewpoint here with excellent views of the three striking mountains. You can then pick up trails along the River Coe with a series of pretty waterfalls to see on the way. Head south west and there's the popular coastal town of Oban to visit. There's a lovely bay and a fine climb to the viewpoint on McCaig's Tower to enjoy here. To the north of the town there's the expansive Loch Creran where you can visit the wildlife rich Shian Woodland Nature Reserve. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
