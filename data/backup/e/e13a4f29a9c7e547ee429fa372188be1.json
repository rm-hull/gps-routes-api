  "description": "Explore nearly 1000 acres of parkland in the valley of the River Clyde in this large country park located between Hamilton and Motherwell.  The main feature of the park is Strathclyde Loch which has a super waterside cycling and walking track.  Surrounding the loch are woodlands, wetlands, wildlife refuges and attractive open parkland. There are miles of miles of surfaced footpaths and nature trails to follow through the woodlands and wetlands areas. The river Clyde also runs through the park so there is a particularly lovely section with the loch on one side and the river on the other. The park has an excellent watersports centre where you can hire rowboats, canoes and windsurfs. Bike hire is also available in the park. The Clyde Walkway walking route  passes through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk/cycle along the river. You could also follow the River Avon south along the Avon Walkway to the nearby Chatelherault Country Park. To the south east there's the RSPB's Barons Haugh where you can look out for a variety of wildlife around the lakes and the river.",
