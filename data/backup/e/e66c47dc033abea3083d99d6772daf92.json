  "description": "This circular walk visits the Minera Lead Mines and the Minera Quarry North Wales Wildlife Trust Nature Reserve near Wrexham. The reserve includes colourful grassland, woodland and several interesting plant species. There's centuries of mining history and evidence of mineral layers laid down over millions of years. It's also great for wildlife with butterflies fluttering around the wildflowers and birds such as spotted flycatcher, redstart, tawny owls and blackcap to look out for in the woodland areas. The walk starts at the car park at the Minera Lead Mines Country Park. The park gives a fascinating glimpse into the industrial past of the beautiful Clywedog Valley. There's an interesting musuem with a restored beam engine house, winding engine and boiler houses. You can then follow a track north west along the dismantled railway to the quarry. After exploring the quarry you head south to climb to Eclusham Mountain and visit more of the Minera Lead Mines. To continue your walking in the area you can head south west to visit World's End where there's more fascinating geology and wonderful scenery to enjoy.",
