  "description": "This circular walk explores Ranmore Common in the North Downs, near Dorking. It is an excellent area for walking with miles of good footpaths taking you through woodland and open downland, with great views of the Surrey Hills. The walk starts from the Denbies Hillside car park and follows the North Downs Way across grassy chalk downland where you will see various types of orchids growing in the summer months. You then pick up bridleways through the common where you will find sheltered woodland trails and some climbs with great viewpoints. The bridleways are also great for cyclists. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head east along the North Downs Way to the nearby Box Hill Country Park. Here you will find more great walking trails with panoramic views of the western Weald and a riverside path along the River Mole. Following the waymarked trail west will take you to Abinger Roughs with its lovely rhododendrons. On the eastern edge of the common you will find the National Trust owned Denbies Hillside where there are waymarked trails with great views over the North Downs from the high points. Just to the north you will find Polesden Lacey where there are miles of trails through the estate of this fine Edwardian house. At Westhumble you can visit Norbury Park. There's woodland, chalk grassland and farmland to explore here.",
