  "description": "This delightful area near Plymouth has recently been restored by the National Trust. It's a lovely stretch of coast and countryside with a good footpath and wonderful views of the Yealm Estuary, the Mewstone, Plymouth Breakwater and onto Rame Head in Cornwall. The surrounding countryside is very pretty too with ox-eye daisies and bluebells in the spring. The walk starts at the Wembury Bay National Trust car park and follows Marine Drive, the old access road to HMS Cambridge, past Blackstone Rocks to Wembury Point. You continue to Heybrook Bay before an inland stretch through the countryside. The final section runs along the coast, returning you to the car park. It's a splendid area with spectacular coastal cliffs and a variety of wildlife. Look out for Dartmoor Ponies, basking sharks, porpoises, dolphins and many different types of birds. Wembury beach is also beautiful with some of the best rock pools in the country. If you wanted to extend your walk then you could pick up the Erme Plym Trail and follow it towards Plymouth. Also just to the east is the lovely Gara Point and Yealm Estuary near Newton Ferrers and Noss Mayo .",

      "content": "The coastal path makes for a fine dog walk and the Eddystone Inn mentioned above is also dog friendly. Please note dogs are not permitted on the main Wembury beach between 1st May and 30th September. Dogs are allowed all year on the nearby Langdon Beach though."

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "Near the car park at the start of the walk you will find the Marine Centre where you can learn all about the marine wildlife in the significant rock pools that can be found around the beach. There's also information on all the different sea birds to look out for in the area here. The Yealmpton Walk visits the area from the nearby village which lies on the River Yealm. In the pretty settlement you could visit the 400 year old Mother Hubbard's cottage. The quaint old dwelling provided the inspiration for the famous nursery rhyme. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
