  "description": "Enjoy the pretty lakes and peaceful woodland trails in this country park near Ockendon and Dagenham. There's also wildflower meadows, open space grassland, bluebells in the spring and lots of wildlife to see. The park is perfect for a nice waterside cycle or walk while there are also good facilities with a visitor centre selling refreshments and gifts. Just to the west you'll find Hornchurch Country Park where there's nice trails along the River Ingrebourne and the largest freshwater reed bed in London. The Ingrebourne Valley can also be picked up in the park.",
