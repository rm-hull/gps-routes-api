  "description": "This seaside resort is located on Cardigan Bay in Gwynedd. The town is located on the Wales coast path which can be followed north to Llwyngwril or south to Aberdovey. There's a lovely long beach to walk along and you are also close to the Snowdonia National Park where there are numerous walking opportunites. The town also has a train station on the Cambrian Line and one on the Talyllyn Railway. The heritage steam railway dates back to 1865 and will take you into Snowdonia on the wonderful old trains. One nice idea is to catch the train to the nearby Dolgoch Falls which are a splendid sight after wet weather. This circular walk from the town takes you along the beach to the mouth of the River Dysynni. The river mouth is a very pretty area located just north west of the town. The walk then visits the Broad Water, a large lake to the north. The lake has some pleasant waterside paths with lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. There's also some great views over the lake to the Snowdonia hills which make a fine backdrop to any photo.",
