The farmhouse is dated 1736, but to the north of it is an open area, or green, between ranges of earlier houses. On the north side of the green is an 18th or 19th century byre that is built onto the east end of a bastle, which in turn is built on the east gable of an earlier bastle. All that remains of the earliest bastle is the lower part of the east end, the wall being 1.21m thick. An impressive byre doorway stands in the centre of the wall and has a monolithic lintel. The second bastle is also a ruin and has walls 0.85m thick built of massive stones. Other building foundations to the south may also contain remains of bastles.'"

  "description": "The village of Allendale is located in a lovely spot by the River East Allen in the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It's also located near to Allen Banks and Hadrian's Wall where there are some fine walking opportunities. The stone built village is very pretty and was twice crowned Village of the Year for All England. This circular riverside walk from the town takes you along the Allen and then through the countryside to the neighbouring village of Catton. The walk starts in the town where you can pick up the Isaac's Tea Trail long distance footpath. The trail follows the river north west to Thornley Gate, Bishopfield Haugh and Kittygreen. Near here you cross the river to follow Colliery Lane north east before heading east on countryside paths to Catton. After exploring the village you head south to rejoin the river which you follow back into Allendale.",
