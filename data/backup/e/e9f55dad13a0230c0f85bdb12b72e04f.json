  "description": "Follow the Beinn Eighe Mountain Trail through a beautiful nature reserve on this circular walk near Kinlochewe, in the Torridon area of Wester Ross in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. On the walk you will pass attractive pinewood woodland, mountainous lochs, white quartzite crags and pretty waterfalls. The views over Loch Maree and the Torridon Mountains are simply stunning. The route starts from the car park at the southern end of Loch Maree. From here you gain access to the waymarked mountain trail. The trail climbs through woodland and past burns and waterfalls to the high point where you will find a small loch and a cairn. It's a challenging walk with steep and rocky sections.",

      "content": "To the north the Loch Maree Walk visits the splendid Victoria Falls. The rushing falls are named after Queen Victoria who visited the site in 1877. Near here there's also Loch Gairloch where you can pick up the Gairloch Waterfall Walk in the lovely Flowerdale Glen. To the east there's the wonderful Corrieshalloch Gorge to visit. Here the River Droma runs through a flora rich gorge, dropping dramitcally through a series of waterfalls, including the 46 metre Falls of Measach. At nearby Loch Broom there's another hidden gem at the delightful Ardessie Falls in the Ardessie Burn gorge. Also nearby is the town of Ullapool where you can climb to the viewpoint at Ullapool Hill and catch the ferry over to Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides. To the north east there's the beautiful Shieldaig Peninsula to explore. There's fine views to Shieldaig Island, Shieldaig Loch and Loch Torridon in this lovely area. Head north and you could visit the village of Poolewe and enjoy a stroll around the beautiful Inverewe Garden. The lochside gardens are a lovely place for a stroll with some nice footpaths taking you to subtropical plants, fine lawns and beautiful flowers. You can also enjoy fine views over Loch Ewe in this scenic area. To the south there's fine waterside trails along the still waters of Loch Clair and Loch Coulin. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
