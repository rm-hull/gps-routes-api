  "description": "A popular walk along a section of the South West Coast Path from Ilfracombe to Hele Bay. It's about a 1.5 mile walk along a cliff top path with some moderate climbing. The route starts at the viewpoint and cave at Capstone Point in Ilfracombe. You then head east past the pier to Hillsborough Fort and Beacon Point. Shortly after you arrive at Hele Bay, passing the small village of Hele which lies just to the south of the path. This includes a Grade II listed corn mill dating back to 1525. At the bay itself you'll find a nice shingle beach, pretty rock pools and mysterious smugglers caves. You can extend the walk by continuing east along the path to Combe Martin on the Ilfracombe to Combe Martin Walk .",
