In 2008 a new automatic screening mechanism was installed (the green and grey shovel-like structure) that will prevent salmon smolts from entering the canal and becoming trapped, instead allowing them to swim down the Tavy to the sea."

  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll along the River Tavy on this short walk in the town of Tavistock. It's a lovely, surfaced path running along a rushing weir with old bridges to see on the way. The walk runs for about 1 mile along both sides of the river, from Abbey Bridge in the north to West Bridge in the south. To continue your walking in the town head to the Tavistock Viaduct where you can enjoy a walk along the old train line with views over the rooftops from the elevated position of the viaduct. The Tavistock Canal also runs parallel to the river so you can easily continue your waterside walking along the towpath.",

It starts in Tavistock and visits the Tavistock Canal and Grenofen Bridge before linking up with the popular Plym Valley Trail. The shared cycling and walking route is named after the explorer Sir Francis Drake who was born in Tavistock and has a statue at the other end of the route in Plymouth."
