  "description": "Follow the Taff Ely Ridgeway Walk/Ffordd y Bryniau through the Ely Valley and Taff Vale on this walk in South Wales. The trail starts near Glynogwr and heads through Llantrisant forest, Llantrisant and Garth Hill before finishing on Caerphilly Common. From Garth Hill there are fine views of Cardiff and the Taff valley. It is thought to be the inspiration for 'Ffynnon Garw', the fictional mountain (or hill) featured in the book, and film, The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain. The walk also passes near to Taff's Well - the only thermal spring in Wales located in Taff's Well park. The walk finishes on Caerphilly Mountain. You can see the tremendous views in the latter part of the video below. The walk is waymarked with a yellow and white disc.",
