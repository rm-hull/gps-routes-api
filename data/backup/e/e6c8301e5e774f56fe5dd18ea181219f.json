  "description": "This Kent based village is located just north of the coast, near Folkestone. It's a nice place for a walk with waterside trails, local woods and some lovely North Downs scenery to enjoy. There's also a fine local pub and a noteworthy church which dates back to the mid 10th century. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Elham Valley Way and the North Downs Way to visit the neighbouring villages of Elham and Etchinghill. You'll also explore the expansive West Woods which is located just north west of the village. Along the way there's views of the Nailbourne stream and the surrounding North Downs countryside. To extend the walk head south east to visit Peene Quarry Country Park. There's some wonderful views to the coast from the elevated position of the old quarry.",
