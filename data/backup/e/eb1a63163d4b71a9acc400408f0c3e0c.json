It additionally includes Hailey Wood and Golding's Wood. To the west there is also the Balls Wood Nature Reserve.",

      "content": "Just to the north of the heath you can pick up the Lea Valley Walk and enjoy a stroll along the River Lea on the Hertford to Ware River and Canal Walk. In Ware you can pick up the circular Ware Walk at the end of the route. This visits the nearby Amwell Nature Reserve where there are good bird watching oppportunities on the two pretty lakes. It then goes on to explore the River Stort around Roydon on the Stort Valley Way before a countryside section on the Harcamlow Way. To the west you can pick up the waymarked Hertfordshire Chain Walk which can be used to explore the Hertfordshire countryside. If you follow it south west for a few miles it will take you to the pretty village of Little Berkhamsted where you can visit the Grade II listed Stratton's Tower, an excellently preserved five-storey observatory dating to 1789. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hertfordshire Walks page."
