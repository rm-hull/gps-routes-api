  "description": "This pleasant town in the Vale of Glamorgan has some lovely coastal walks along the Bristol Channel. You can stroll down to Colhugh Beach which has the remnants of an Iron Age fort and some of the finest examples of Jurassic Period fossils in Wales. It's also a popular spot for surfers when the conditions are right. In the town there's medieval cobbled streets and some fine 15th and 16th century buildings to see. Of particular interest to historians is the 13th-century St Illtyd's Church, which was built near the ancient monastery. The church is a Grade I listed building and one of the oldest parish churches in Wales. It highlights the significance of the town as the most important early Christian settlement in Wales, founded by St Illtud. This walk takes you from the town to the coastal viewpoint at Nash Point . It's about a 4 mile walk from the town to the lighthouse along a reasonably flat path which forms part of the Glamorgan Heritage Coast . Start the walk from the town centre near to the visitor centre. From here you can pick up footpaths and head south to meet up with the Afon Col-Huw. You then follow the river down to Llantwit Major beach. The route then heads west to Tresilian Bay where there's an old Second World War pill box and some fine views. The route continues to St Donat's, passing the college and medieval castle before coming to Nash Point. Here you'll find a Grade II listed lighthouse, which dates from 1831-32. There's some wonderful cliff top views over the Bristol Channel from here. After taking in the views you return to the town on the same paths.",
