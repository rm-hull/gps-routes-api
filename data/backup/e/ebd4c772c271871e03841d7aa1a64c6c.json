  "description": "Godstone is a very pretty village in Surrey with the typical English village green and cricket pitch. It's also surrounded by the lovely countryside of the North Downs and the Greensand Ridge that crosses Kent and Surrey. This circular walk from the village takes you to a series of pretty local ponds before climbing onto the Greensand Way at Tilburstow Hill. On the way there's some nice waterside stretches, woodland sections and good views from the high points. The walk starts in the village centre and follows footpaths east to Bay Pond and Glebe Water. You then head south across Leigh Place Pond where you pick up the Greensand Way. Follow the waymarked footpath south west past Tilburstow Hill where there's some nice woodland trails. After passing the common and hill the route turns north through Garston Park to return you to the village.",
