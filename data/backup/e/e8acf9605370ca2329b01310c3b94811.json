  "description": "This Suffolk based market town has some nice trails to try through the valley of the River Fromus.  The wonderful Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB is also not far away and provides some of the best walking trails in the area. In the town there's also some fine old buildings including a series of Elizabethan cottages and a church dating back to the 11th century. This walk from the village follows the East Suffolk Line Walks south to visit Snape Maltings. The walk starts in the village and heads south to Benhall Green and Snape Watering. You continue along Hulver Lane and Gromford Lane before arriving at Snape. Here you'll find the Maltings nature reserve which includes reedbeds, wet woodland and marshland with lots of wildlife to see. The area also includes an expansive arts complex on the banks of the River Alde. It's best known for its concert hall, which is one of the main sites of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. The complex also includes shops, galleries and restaurants where you can enjoy refreshments before the return leg. The walk can be extended by continuing south to Blaxhall Common and Tunstall Forest where there are miles of good cycling and walking trails. The Suffolk Coast Path can also be picked up in this area. If you follow it east it will take you to the coast at Aldeburgh and Thorpeness .",
