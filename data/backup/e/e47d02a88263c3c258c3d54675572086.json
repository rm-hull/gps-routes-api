  "description": "This walk follows a popular path through Stickle Ghyll to Stickle Tarn in the Great Langdale area of the Lake District. The path runs alongside the spectactular Dungeon Ghyll Force waterfall and involves a climb of about 1500 ft on a series of stone steps. Most of the path consists of fairly easy stone steps although there are a couple of rockier sections which require a bit of scrambling. The walk is very popular with young families. When you reach the summit you are rewarded with magnificent views of the surrounding area, with Lake Windermere and Elterwater clearly visible. The walk then takes you around the peaceful Stickle Tarn before descending to the start point at the car park. At the end of the walk you'll find the National Trust run Sticklebarn where you can buy a well earned drink! One other option is to head to the nearby Easedale Tarn by heading east from Stickle Tarn rather than descending the waterfall. The Cumbria Way runs past Dungeon Ghyll too. If you follow it east you can visit the lovely Elterwater Lake and enjoy a stroll along the River Brathay to Skelwith Force Waterfall. The climb through Hell Gill Gorge also starts from the Old Dungeon Ghyll Hotel car park and includes a series of lovely waterfalls and more great views.",
