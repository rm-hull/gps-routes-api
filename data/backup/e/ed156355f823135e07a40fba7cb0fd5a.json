  "description": "This waterside walk takes you around Lough Macrory in the village of Loughmacrory, County Tyrone. There's a lovely 2km circular trail running along the shoreline with lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. The pleasant surfaced trail should take about 30-45 minutes. Near the lake there is also an ancient wedge Tomb that dates back to around 4000 years. To continue your walking in the area head west to Gortin Glen where there's a red graded mountain bike trail and a series of waymarked footpaths to try. There's also streams, waterfalls, lots of wildlife and some fine views towards the nearby Sperrin Mountains.",
