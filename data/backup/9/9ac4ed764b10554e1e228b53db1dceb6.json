It was formed about 500 million years ago from molten igneous materials deep in the earth\u0092s crust. In 1995 planning permission was given to the quarry to take 45 million tonnes of material away. At the current extraction rate this will take over 20 years. When this is done the quarry will be doubled in depth, eventually being 160m below sea level at its deepest point."

      "caption": "3 stages of geological development at the quarry. The rock being quarried is granite, so the lowest levels are relatively early igneous formations. The slightly redder patch just to the right of the strong near-vertical shadow just right of centre shows tightly curved strata (not clearly visible at this scale) indicative of a rising stream of magma. The second stage is the clear evidence of glacial erosion of the granite shown by the smoothly curved boundary between the granite and the overlying sedimentary formations. A noticeable feature of the latter is the way they have been deposited preferentially into the hollows of the underlying granite so that the successive layers show less and less curvature, ending with an essentially horizontal top layer. The sedimentary deposits are mainly red mudstone with some thin intermediate layers of lighter coloured deposits."

  "description": "This walk visits the Croft Hill viewpoint and the old Croft Quarry near Leicester. It's a photogoenic spot with fascinating geology and fine views over the area from the hill top. There's no public access to the quarry itself but there are public footpaths heading around the site with fine views down to the quarry workings. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north to the River Soar at Croft Bridge before heading along the western side of the quarry. This will take you up to Croft Hill which stands at a height of 128 metres at the northern end of the quarry. From here there are excellent views over the quarry to the surrounding countryside. You can then pass along a path heading north east towards the neighbouring village of Huncote.",
