  "description": "Enjoy a lovely circular walk around the village of Fonthill Bishop on this circular walk near Salisbury in Wiltshire. There's much to enjoy with woodland trails, countryside views and a waterside section along the pretty Fonthill Lake. The walk starts in the village and then climbs south east towards Ridge Hill, passing through woodland along the way. It's a moderate climb to a height of over 500ft with great views of the Wiltshire countryside from the high points. At Ridge Hill you turn south west, descending to Fonthill Lake. The large lake is 1.6 km (1 mi) long and about 100 m (328 ft) wide. It's a beautiful, peaceful spot with Mandarin ducks and Swans to look out for on the water. The lake was used as the location for the filming of all the river scenes in the film Chocolat with Johnny Depp. At the southern end of the lake you can pick up a footpath along the River Nadder and visit Tisbury village if you have time. This route then follows the lake north past Fonthill Park to the village. It's a lovely section with nice views across the lake to the surrounding woodland and farmland.",
