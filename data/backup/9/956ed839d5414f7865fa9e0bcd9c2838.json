  "description": "This route in Queen Elizabeth Forest Park follows National Cycle Route 7 through the Achray Forest to two beautiful lochs in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The route starts in the village of Aberfoyle and follows good woodland paths to Lochan Reoidhte and then on to Loch Drunkie. You continue on more forest tracks before a long lochside stretch along Loch Venachar. There's great views across the water to the surrounding woodland, hills and mountains. If you'd like to explore the area further then you can head to the nearby Loch Katrine for more wonderful waterside cycling and walking trails. Loch Ard also has some great woodland cycle and walking trails while the fascinating Inchmahome Priory is only a few miles east of Aberfoyle. Just to the north of Loch Venachar you can pick up a nice waymarked trail through Glen Finglas. Here you will find rivers, streams, waterfalls and the lovely Glen Finglas Reservoir. The walk to Ben Venue also starts from near to Loch Achray, just to the west of Loch Venachar. It's a popular climb with great views back down to the loch.",
