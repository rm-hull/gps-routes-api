Until the 20th century, Bo'ness was the site of various industrial activities, including coal mining, saltmaking and pottery production. With its location beside the Forth, the town and its harbour grew in importance in the industrial revolution and later continued to grow into the Victorian era."

  "description": "This walk runs from the town of Borrowstounness (Bo'ness) to Blackness Castle on the south bank of the Firth of Forth in the Central Lowlands of Scotland. The route follows shared cycling and walking trail along the Firth for just over 4 miles. It's a flat, surfaced multi user path with excellent views across the water to Charlestown and Limekilns on the other side. The walk finishes at the wonderfully positioned ruins of the 15th century Blackness Castle. You can extend the walk to South Queensferry on the Blackness to South Queensferry Walk. This passes Hopetoun House where there is an expansive estate surrounding the 18th century mansion. At the start of the walk in Bo'ness you can visit the Museum of Scottish Railways and the regional motor museum. There's also a number of interesting listed buildings in the pleasant conservation area.",
