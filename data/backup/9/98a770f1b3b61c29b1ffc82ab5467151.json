Until the 20th century, Bo'ness was the site of various industrial activities, including\u00a0coal mining,\u00a0saltmaking\u00a0and\u00a0pottery\u00a0production. With its location beside the Forth, the town and its harbour grew in importance in the\u00a0industrial revolution\u00a0and later continued to grow into the\u00a0Victorian era."

The route follows shared cycling and walking trail along the Firth for just over 4 miles. It's a flat, surfaced multi user path with excellent views across the water to Charlestown and Limekilns on the other side. The walk finishes at the wonderfully positioned ruins of the 15th century Blackness Castle. You can extend the walk to South Queensferry on the Blackness to South Queensferry Walk .
