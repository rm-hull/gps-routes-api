  "description": "This walk visits Devoke Water, the largest tarn in the Lake District. It's a very peaceful area being a bit of a hidden Lake District gem. To start the walk you can park by the side of the road at Austhwaite Brow and pick up the bridleway to the tarn. It's about a half mile walk from the road to the tarn with the footpath heading along the southern side of the water. You have the option of continuing around the tarn to climb Water Crag and Rough Crag where there are great views towards Eskdale and the Scafell range. The video below shows and extended circular walk visiting these fells. To extend your walk you can continue west along the bridleway to Birkby Fell and then onto Muncaster Castle near the coast at Ravenglass . The castle estate has 77 acres of gardens and over 6 miles of walking paths to try. If you head north from the tarn you can visit the lovely Stanley Ghyll Force Waterfall . The falls are located in Eskdale and drop 60 feet into a narrow river gorge with attractive woodland and views of the River Esk. They are located just over a mile north of the start point for this route.",
