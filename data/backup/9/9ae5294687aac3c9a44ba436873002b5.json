  "description": "Explore the 100 acres of beautiful landscaped gardens surrounding this 18th century country house in Leeds. A series of well laid out footpaths take you to the Terrace, the Lakeside Garden, the Himalayan Garden and the Walled Garden. The wider estate is also a deer park with 155 Red, 45 Fallow and 45 Roe deer to look out for. From the Terrace there are wonderful views of the surrounding Yorkshire countryside. It also includes a stunning Parterre with 20000 plants and bulbs and ornate fountains. The 32 acre lake is another major feature in the grounds. You can stroll alongside the lake then head into the surrounding woodland on either side of the water. Here you will find peaceful wooded glades and a large collection of colourful rhododendrons. From here you can easily access the stunning Himalayan Garden. Footpaths will take you through a gorge and over a bridge across a beck to a garden with primulas, orchids, cobra lilies and blue poppies. You'll also find the Harewood Stupa, a Buddhist monument built  by monks from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. Another major attraction in the grounds is the marvellous bird garden. Here you'll see a number of exotic birds including Humboldt penguins, Snowy Owl, Red Kites, Chilean flamingos, Duyvenbode's lories, macaws, rainbow lorikeets and snow geese. Also look out for Kingfishers near the waterfall by the lake. You can also walk around the fascinating 18th century house and view a number of fine portraits, beautiful furniture, Renaissance masterpieces and a collection of Sevres china. This walk makes use of the Leeds Country Way long distance walk. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area you could follow this path west to Eccup Reservoir and on to Golden Acre Park which are only a few miles away. Hetchell Woods Nature Reserve is also very nearby and worth a visit. The site includes the fascinating historic site of Pompocali where there are extensive earthworks on the course of an old Roman Road.",
