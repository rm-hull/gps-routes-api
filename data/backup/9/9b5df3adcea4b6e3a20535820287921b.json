The locomotives of the time couldn\u0092t cope with the steep gradients on the line, so two steam powered winding engines were built which pulled the trains up the hills with a cable. One was at Tyler Hill and the other was here at Clowes Wood. This pond provided it with water."

  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this area of woodland near Whitstable. The site is also a nature reserve and includes attractive mixed woodland, heathland and wet meadow. Look out for wildlife which includes woodpeckers, Woodcock and if you're lucky an owl. Part of National Cycle Route 1, known as the Crab and Winkle Way, passes through the woods. You could follow this lovely traffic free path from nearby Whitstable to reach the woods. The walk can be extended by heading east through Thornden Wood and West Blean Wood to the splendid Wildwood Forest Park. Here you will find a wonderful collection of animals including badgers, foxes, otters, pine marten and red squirrels. Also in Thornden Wood you can climb Knockhimdown Hill for nice views over the area. To extend your walking in the area you can head to Whitstable harbour and try the Whitstable to Herne Bay Walk along the coast.",
