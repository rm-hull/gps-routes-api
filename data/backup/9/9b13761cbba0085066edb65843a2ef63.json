  "description": "This walk takes you from the popular town of Wells-next-the-Sea to Blakeney where you can visit the lovely Blakeney Point Nature Reserve. The walk uses a section of the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path to take you between the two locations. There's lovely views across Stiffkey Marshes, pretty beaches and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The route finishes at Blakeney Chapel but you can head west along the beach to further explore the reserve. There is a mixed colony of around 500 seals which can be seen on the beach or from boat trips departing from Morston Quay to Blakeney Point. You can also continue east along the coast path to Cley Marshes Nature Reserve. This 430 acre reserve contains reed beds, freshwater marsh, pools and wet meadows. To continue your walking in the area you could try the Wells to Holkham Walk and visit the wonderful 3000 acre estate at Holkham Park .",
