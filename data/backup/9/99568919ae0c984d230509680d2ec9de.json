This vista, looking north, has been irrevocably changed due to extensive sand quarrying, which has lowered the ground level just in front of the lodge by around 60 feet. The explanatory plaque shows the changed ground profile. His avenue of trees has been replanted, but needs a few years of growth yet.The Duke's mausoleum (red sandstone, domed roof) can be seen in the distance above the plaque."
