The explanatory plaque shows the changed ground profile. His avenue of trees has been replanted, but needs a few years of growth yet.The Duke's mausoleum (red sandstone, domed roof) can be seen in the distance above the plaque."

This trail runs along the River Clyde passing the photogenic ruins of the 13th century Bothwell Castle. Just east of the park there's the Barons Haugh Nature Reserve where there are more riverside trails and lots of wildlife spotting opportunites. A few miles west in East Kilbride there's the delightful Calderglen Country Park. There's more river paths here along the Calder River with pretty waterfalls to see on the way."
