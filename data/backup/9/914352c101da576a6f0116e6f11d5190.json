  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of the South West Coast Path from Westward Ho to Clovelly on the North Devon Coast. The route runs for just over 10 miles along a cliff top path with some moderate climbs. Along the way there are wonderful views over Barnstaple and Bideford Bay. You start off on the front in Westward Ho and head south west along the waymarked footpath to Cornborough Cliff, Abbotsham Cliff, Green Cliff, Cockington Cliff, Westacott Cliff and Higher Rowden. You continue past Peppercombe Castle before coming to the pretty village of Buck's Mills. The final section takes you past the woods and nature reserves in Buck's Mills before running along the lovely Clovelly Bay and finishing in Clovelly village.",
