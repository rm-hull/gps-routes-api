The structure was completely rebuilt after a fire in 1928 and only a broken font and a few other fixtures survive from the earlier building. The churchyard was probably once sub-circular. Totally rebuilt in 1928. Old stone re-used, but upper wall faces of nave have new masonry."

  "description": "This pretty village in Powys is in a fine location for exploring the surrounding hills and countryside of the Black Mountains , the Brecon Beacons and the Usk Valley . There's also nice local trails along the canal and river which flow through this picturesque area. This circular walk from the village follows paths along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and the River Usk. The walk starts from the public car park in the village and follows a footpath north east past Pencommin to the canal. Follow the towpath west and it will link up with the river after about a mile. You can then follow a riverside path east passing the old Llangynidr Bridge and a waterfall. At Cyffredyn you turn west to return to the village.",
