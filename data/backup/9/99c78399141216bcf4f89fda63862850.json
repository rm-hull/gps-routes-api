  "description": "This delightful Cheshire based village is a fine place for an easy stroll. The historic settlement is very pretty with listed timber framed buildings and a picturesque churchyard to explore. As such it is one of the most desirable places to live in the north with many celebrities and footballers purchasing properties in the area. Also of interest is the fine 17th century pub where you can enjoy post walk refreshments. You can find the village close to Wilmslow and Alderley Edge on elevated ground above the River Bollin. This short circular walk in the village takes you along the High Street and the River Bollin visiting the old church and the photogenic Norman Chapel on the way. Just north of the village you can extend the walk at the Grade II listed Mottram Hall . The estate includes 270 acres of beautiful landscaped gardens surrounding a fine 18th century hall which now operates as a hotel. For more detailed information on the history, village conservation area, churches, transport and local notable people see the informative wikipedia page.",
