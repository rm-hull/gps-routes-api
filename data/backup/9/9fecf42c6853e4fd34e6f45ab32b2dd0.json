Formerly the Trinity paper mill it was owned by Mondi when this picture was taken in 2007.\nMondi are the country's third largest corrugated packaging company making corrugated sheet from recycled cardboard at this plant in Ramsbottom. In September 2008 the Austrian paper mill operator Mondi announced that it had entered into a staff consultation over the closure of its Holcombe Mill in Ramsbottom. Holcombe Mill produced 105,000 tonnes of recycled containerboard a year for the UK market. Mondi also blamed rising energy costs, declining demand and a slowing economy for the closure.\nThe mill closed down in December 2008 and remains empty to this day. In January 2007 the park was badly flooded after the nearby river Irwell burst its banks."

  "description": "This village near Ramsbottom is a lovely place for a stroll. There's good riverside trails, a heritage railway, old mills and pretty cottages to see in this attractive conservation area. The walk starts from the train station on the East Lancashire Railway and follows the Irwell Sculpture Trail north to visit the river and mills in the village. You'll pass Brooksbottom where there's an interesting old mill and an impressive six arched viaduct over the river. The route continues up to Nuttall Park where there are some nice riverside trails and views of the passing old trains to enjoy.",
