  "description": "This walk climbs to Great Mis Tor in the Dartmoor National Park. You can start the walk from the Merrivale Prehistoric Site car park which lies just to the south of the tor. From here you can pick up a trail heading north to Little Mis Tor and Great Mis Tor. There's some fine rock formations and wonderful views over Dartmoor from here. If you have time head south from the car park to explore Merrivale's standing stones and ancient stone circle. Just to the north west you'll find the climb to Great Staple Tor and Roos Tor. The Merrivale Quarry can also be found in this interesting and attractive area.",
