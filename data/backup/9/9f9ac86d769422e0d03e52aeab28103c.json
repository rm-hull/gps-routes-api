  "description": "Follow the Padley Gorge Trail through the stunning Hope Valley in the Peak District. The hugely popular walking trail runs along the lovely Burbage Brook with its pretty waterfalls, rocky boulders and wooden bridges. You start off at Grindleford Station which you can reach direct from Manchester or Sheffield. The trail is signposted so you can pick it up quite easily. It runs for about 1.5 miles through Yarncliff Wood and then into more open countryside. You can return the same way or head into the beautiful Longshaw Estate to extend your walk. It's a great area for wildlife spotting. Look out for dippers, pied flycatchers, wood warblers and redstarts. The woods at Yarncliff are also a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and described as 'the best example of the remnant oak-birch woodland that once covered much of the edges of the gritstone uplands of the Peak District'. There's plenty of nice spots for a picnic next to the babbling brook and its pretty rockpools. You can also find refreshment at the excellent Grindleford Station Cafe, near the start of the route. The gorge is close to the village of Hathersage so you could start your walk from there if you prefer. You're also close to Stanage Edge where you can enjoy fabulous views and interesting rock formations. For a longer walk you could try our Padley Gorge Circular Walk which passes the Fox House Inn and the Longshaw visitor centre.",

The rustic country pub/restaurant includes a comfort food menu and exposed beams. In Grindleford there's The Sir William Hotel, housed in a fine 18th century stone building. They have a decent bar menu and a beautiful terraced garden over-looking the Derwent river valley. If the weather is fine it's a great place to enjoy a drink and a bite to eat. You can find it in the village on Sir William Hill Road with a postcode of S32 2HS for your sat navs."
