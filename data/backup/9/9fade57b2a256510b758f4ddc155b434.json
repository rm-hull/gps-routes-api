  "description": "Explore the beautiful and extensive grounds of Queen Victoria's royal seaside palace on this lovely walk near Cowes on the Isle of Wight. You can stroll through the numerous delightful gardens before heading to the coast and Queen Victoria's private beach where there are fabulous views across the Solent. Just south of the house you can pick up the Isle of Wight Coast Path and follow it east to visit Quarr Abbey. The Grade I listed abbey monastery dates back to the 12th century and includes a scenic estate with lovely gardens, wildflower meadows and woodland with red squirrels to look out for. The abbey makes a fine extension to your walk.",

The site includes lots of wildlife and views of the picturesque Wootton Bridge Old Mill Pond on its western side. Near here there's also the Isle of Wight Heritage Steam Railway train centre at Havenstreet Station, where the old trains make their way to join the electrified Ryde-Shanklin line at Smallbrook. The quaint station has been carefully restored to reflect a 1940s British Railways (Southern) style station. There is also a nice cafe and exhibits here. The station is located just a mile south of the woods at postcode PO33 4DS."
