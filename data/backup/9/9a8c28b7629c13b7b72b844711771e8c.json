  "description": "This walk visits two of the major highlights on the Forth and Clyde Canal in central Scotland. The route runs for just over 4 miles along the flat canal towpath. The walk starts at the car park at the Falkirk Wheel in Falkirk. The striking boat lift connects the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal. After circling the wheel cross the canal on the footbridge and you can pick up the towpath on the north side of the water. Follow the trail east and it will take you past Summerford, Lock Sixteen, Grahamston and Mungalend before coming to the Kelpies. The impressive sculptures are 30 metres high depicting shape-shifting water spirits that resemble horses. They are located at the point where the canal meets with the River Carron near Grangemouth.",
