  "description": "Explore the area surrounding the Oxfordshire town of Banbury on this long circular walk. The attractive market town is surrounded by some lovely countryside with miles of good footpaths to follow. It's a very rural area so the town makes for a great base for walkers. This walk makes use of waymarked long distance trails to visit some of the highlights of the area. This includes the Oxford Canal , Spiceball Country Park , the River Cherwell and a series of pretty villages. The walk starts in the centre of town and follows the Oxford Canal towpath south, before turning north east along the Jurassic Way . You cross the River Cherwell before heading through the countryside to Middleton Cheney, Chacombe and Upper Wardington.  The route then passes the Grade I listed Edgcote House before coming to Chipping Warden where you pick up the Macmillan Way . This takes you west to meet up with the canal at Claydon Locks. Following the canal south through Cropredy then takes you back to Banbury, with nice views of the Cherwell as you go. Just before finishing the walk you will pass Grimsbury Reservoir and the pretty Spiceball Country Park with wild flower meadows, community woodland and several areas of native trees and shrubs. You can virtually follow a section of the Oxford Canal through Banbury using the google street view link below!",
