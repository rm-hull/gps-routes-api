  "description": "Visit this historically significant hill on this interesting walk in Devizes. The hill is the site of a famous Civil War battle where a Royalist cavalry force under Lord Wilmot won a crushing victory over the Parliamentarians in 1643. You'll also visit the iron age hillfort of Oliver's Castle and enjoy views of the Devizes White Horse and the surrounding Wiltshire countryside. The walk starts from the Roundway Hill car park next to Oliver's Castle. You could also easily walk to the site from Devizes by following the Wessex Ridgeway north for about two miles. You can then follow a circular route around the site for about 4 miles. There's also the option of exploring the woodland of the Roundway Hill Covert with its 68 acres of broadleaf woodland. This route is designed for walkers but the area is also good for mountain biking with trails running across Roundway Hill and the adjacent Beacon Hill. To extend your walk you can continue along the Wessex Ridgeway towards Morgan's Hill where you can pick up the Wansdyke Path. It's located about two miles north east of the car park at the start of this walk. You could also visit the nearby Cherhill White Horse which is also located near Morgan's Hill.",
