  "description": "Explore the Dimmingsdale Valley and Furnace Forest on this lovely wooded walk. Waymarked footpaths will take you along a series of pools and streams with interesting sandstone outcrops and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Start the walk from the car park next to the Ramblers Retreat. The award winning country tearoom is a great place for refreshments before or after your walk. From the car park pick up the footpaths heading west through Threap Wood in the beautiful valley. You'll pass a number of photogenic pools where you can look out for birds such as black swan, heron, kingfisher, moorhen and Canada Goose. Buzzards and Muntjac deer have also been spotted in the area. Heather and wildflowers attract a number of different types of butterfly in the summer months too. After passing the pools there's some moderate climbing up to Oldfurnace and Stoney Dale where you can pick up the Staffordshire Way long distance trail. This will take you back to the car park. The woods are located in the Churnet Valley where there are more great walking opportunites along the Caldon Canal. You can follow the Staffordshire Way north from the forest to Froghall where you can pick up the canal towpath. Near Froghall you can also visit Consall Nature Park. There's more nice woodland trails here with large ponds, streams and a more challenging climb to Kingsley Banks where there are wonderful views over the Churnet Valley. The woods are located close to the pretty village of Oakamoor. Our Oakamoor Walk visits Dimmingsdale from the village and also explores the National Trust's Hawksmoor Wood.",

      "content": "The Cheadle Walk visits the site from the nearby town. It also passes through the National Trust's Hawksmoor Nature Reserve so it's a nice way of visiting the two sites from the town. About three miles south of the woods you will find the remains of the 12th century Croxden Abbey. There are nice trails to follow around the substantial abbey ruins with information boards detailing the history of the site. It's an interesting area and run by English Heritage with no charge for your visit. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
