  "description": "The North Yorkshire village of Osmotherley is situated on the western edge of the\u00a0North York Moors National Park in the Hambleton Hills . It's a lovely area for walking with trails through the nearby woodland and around the nearby Cod Beck Reservoir. This circular walk around Osmotherley visits the medieval Mount Grace Priory and Cod Beck Reservoir . It's a lovely area with waymarked paths, woodland trails, hill climbs and waterside paths to enjoy. The walk starts in Osmotherley village and picks up the Cleveland Way long distance trail to take you north west to Mount Grace Wood and the priory. The fascinating Carthusian\u00a0house dates from the 14th century when it was founded by\u00a0Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey\u00a0the son of King\u00a0Richard II's half-brother\u00a0Thomas, Earl of Kent. The site is now run by the English Heritage and the National Trust so visitors today can explore the ruins of the whole\u00a0monastery, \ntogether with the typically small Carthusian chapel and the later house. It also includes a museum and pretty gardens where there are a variety of beautiful plants including snowdrops in the winter. After exploring the priory the route then returns to the Cleveland Way to take you through Arncliffe Wood where you can see lots of pretty bluebells in the spring. The trail bends round to Scarth Wood Moor where you turn south along a country lane to take you to Cod Beck Reservoir, passing the popular tourist spot of Sheepwash and the Cod Beck. You can follow nice footpaths along the reservoir which is surrounded by attractive woodland and moorland scenery. From the reservoir it's a short stroll back to the village centre where the route finishes. To continue your walking in the area you could continue along the Cleveland Way and visit the fascinating ancient sites at the Lord Stones and the Wainstones . The climb to Carlton Bank near Carlton in Cleveland is also located in this area. The Lyke Wake Walk also passes through the village. The route is a complete crossing of the North Yorkshire Moors from west to east and a great way to explore the area.",
