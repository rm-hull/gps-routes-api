It was originally cut into the sheer sides of the gorge to accommodate a tramway to bring 'silica rock' - a particularly pure sandstone suitable for the manufacture of refractory bricks - down from the various mines further up the valley. However the rock outcrop here is an example of another thick bed of sandstone known as the 'Farewell Rock' which marks the very base of the South Wales Coal Measures. Mining below it was fruitless, as no further ironstone or coal seams would be encountered - 'farewell' to useful mining - hence the colourful name."

  "description": "This walk in Pontneddfechan visits Sgwd Gwladus in Wales' beautiful waterfall country. The route runs for about 5 miles, following Nedd Fechan past a series of lovely waterfalls in a peaceful wooded valley. The walk starts  in the village of Pontneddfechan where you can pick up the footpath along the Nedd Fechan and follow it north to Sgwd Gwladus. Also known as The Lady Fall these elegant falls drop from a height of about 20 feet. The falls are named after Gwladus, one of the daughters of the 5th century prince Brychan. It's a lovely spot with the rushing falls and a series of stepping stones over the River Pyrddin. The route then continues to visit Scwd Einion Gam and Scwd Ddwli before turning round at the bridge to the north of the latter falls. You then return to the village on the same paths. There's lots of good options for continuing your walking in Waterfall Country. The Four Waterfalls Walk, the Neath Waterfalls Walk and Melincourt Falls all offer good paths of varying lengths.",
