  "description": "This walk climbs to Great Asby Scar from the village of Great Asby in Cumbria. The area is located just to the south west of the village and has been designated as a\u00a0national nature reserve. It includes some splendid\u00a0limestone\u00a0geology and interesting flora growing in its\u00a0extensive limestone pavement\u00a0areas. The area is a remote and peaceful hidden gem and perfect for a quiet walk in unusual surroundings. From the elevated spot there are also stunning views to the surrounding Lake District fells. You can reach the site by following Style Lane from the village to Asby Winderwath Common before turning south to climb to Knott which stands at a height of 412 metres. The route continues across the pavement to High Pike before descending back to the village. To extend the walk continue west to Orton Scar where you can climb Beacon Hill and visit the Jubilee Tower. To continue your walking in the area head north to visit Rutter Force waterfall just south of Appleby .",
