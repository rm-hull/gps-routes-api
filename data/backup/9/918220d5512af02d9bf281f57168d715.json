      "content": "Derryounce Bog, originally developed by Bord na M\u00f3na as part of the larger Clonsast bog group in the mid-20th century, has undergone significant transformation over the decades. Initially, the bog was extensively harvested for sod peat, which supplied the Portarlington power station. Industrial peat extraction continued for several decades until the 1980s when the production ceased. Following the cessation of peat harvesting, the remaining cutaway bog was taken over by Coillte, who planted a conifer plantation on the site. A notable feature of the transformed landscape is Lough Lurgan, a lake that formed naturally after the peat production stopped and the pumps were turned off, leading to the flooding of a central basin created by the lowered ground levels. Nugent\u2019s Hill, located to the west of Derryounce Lake, is another significant area within the bog, featuring dry grassland and woodlands. Historical maps indicate that this area once had human habitation, with a well and spring that were important to the local community. Derryounce Lake, an artificial creation, was formed by digging down to the sand layer beneath the peat, with the displaced sand forming an unofficial inland beach that is popular during the summer months. The surrounding wetlands, lakes, and forestry areas now make up the Derryounce Lakes and Walkways, an amenity area leased by the Portarlington Community Development Association (PCDA) from Bord na M\u00f3na. This area is now valued as a peaceful recreational space for various activities, including walking, angling, photography, and enjoying the natural environment, providing a serene escape for local residents and visitors alike. To further continue your walking in the area head south to visit a local historical highlight at the Rock Of Dunamase. Here you can explore the atmospheric ruins of a fascinating ancient Celtic fortification. Near here you can also pick up the epic Slieve Bloom Way."
