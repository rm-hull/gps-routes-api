  "description": "This circular loop walk explores the Derryounce Lakes near the town of Portarlington on the border of County Laois and County Offaly. You'll pass along raised walkways as you make your way around the bog, peaceful woodland and pretty lakes. It's a great place for nature with lots of interesting plants and wildlife to see. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit Emo Court . The splendid neo-classical mansion is surrounded by lovely woodland, parkland, gardens and a lake.",
