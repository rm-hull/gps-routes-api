  "description": "Goulceby is a Lincolnshire Wolds village located in the East Lindsey district of the county. This circular walk from the village takes you to the lovely Red Hill Nature Reserve which lies just to the north of the settlement. The reserve includes a waymarked trail taking you around steep chalk escarpment grassland and a disused quarry with an exposure of Red Chalk, rich in fossils. There's plenty of lovely rare flora which attracts a variety of butterflies and moths. The meadow pipit also nests in the reserve. From the high points of the elevated escarpment there are some splendid views over the surrounding Lincolnshire Wolds countryside to enjoy. You can reach the reserve by following public footpaths and country lanes north from the village. It's just over a mile walk from Goulceby to the site. The Lincolnshire Wolds Way and the Viking Way long distance footpaths pass through the village. You could follow the Viking Way north to visit neighbouring Donington on Bain where you could enjoy some riverside trails along the River Bain and visit the historic 12th century church.",
