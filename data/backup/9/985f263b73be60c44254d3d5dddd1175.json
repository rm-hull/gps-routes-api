  "description": "This lovely park in Solihull has nice footpaths and a cycle trail to follow. The 130 acre site includes a large lake, woodland, ornamental gardens and a local nature reserve which includes the delightful Brueton Tree Trail. Follow the trail and look out for several different tree species including English Oak, Giant Redwood, Maidenhair and Indian Bean Tree.  There's also an excellent visitor centre with a wealth of information about the area. There is a car park off Warwick Road where you can start your exercise. Solihull train station is less than a mile away so you could come by public transport too.The park also hosts a popular parkrun every Saturday morning at 9:00 am. To contiinue your walk you could pick up the Solihull Way which passes the park's western side. If you head north you will soon come to the Grand Union Canal where you can enjoy a waterside stroll along the towpath. Head south along the trail and you will come to the Stratford Upon Avon Canal . Also nearby is Tudor Grange Park which includes a lake, the Alder Brook stream, a cycle track and a pitch and putt course.",
