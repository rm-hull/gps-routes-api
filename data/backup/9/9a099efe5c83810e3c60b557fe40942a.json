  "description": "This short circular walk visits Birchanger Wood from the village of Birchanger near Bishop's Stortford. The woods are located just west of the village and have some peaceful trails to explore. There's lots of flora and fauna to see with pretty bluebells in the spring months. The site is well maintained and includes benches for picnics too. Northolt Avenue Park can also be visited in this area. To continue your woodland walking in the area, head a couple of miles east to visit the more expansive Hatfield Forest .",
