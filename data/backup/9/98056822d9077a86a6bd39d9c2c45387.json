  "description": "This town in Powys is located close to the Welsh-English border on the Montgomery Canal .\nThis walk takes you along a section of the canal from Welshpool to Berriew for a distance of about 5 miles using a flat path. As such the walk is suitable for most abilities. In Berriew you can enjoy some refreshments at the local pub before returning. On the way you'll pass Powis Castle , located just to the west of the canal. At Belan locks you could take a small detour, following a public footpath north west to the site. Here you'll find stunning gardens regarded as one of the greatest surviving examples of Baroque garden design in Britain. There's also some pockets of woodland to explore on the Belan side of the canal. At Berriew you'll pass the Berriew aqueduct which carries the Montgomery Canal over the River Rhiw. You can cross the river on the Berriew Bridge and explore the village before returning along the towpath.",
