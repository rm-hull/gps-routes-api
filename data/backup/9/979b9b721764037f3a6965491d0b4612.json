  "description": "This attractive market town is located in North Devon in the valley of the River Little Dart. It's a worthy place to visit with a number of old thatched buildings and a church dating to the 15th century. There's also a fine 17th century pub to relax in after your exercise. This walk from the town takes you along a section of the Ridge and Valley Walk to visit the nearby Eggesford Forest and Eggesford Garden Centre. You can pick up the waymarked Ridge and Valley Walk in the town and follow it south, crossing the River Dart before coming to Upcott Wood and Eggesford Forest. The woods are a fine place for a walk with Douglas Fir trees, pretty streams, an ancient motte and bailey castle and lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. The walk then heads west to visit the Eggesford Garden & Country Centre. Here you can enjoy a pleasant stroll and admire the quality plants and flowers on display. There's also a fine Restaurant selling delicous home made cakes. In this area you can also pick up the popular Tarka Trail long distance walk.",

      "content": "After your walk you could enjoy refreshments at the Old Court House Inn. The historic building dates from around 1633 and was at that time a local Court. The original Charles 1 \u2018Coat of Arms\u2019 plaque remains. The inn was visited by the King in 1634 whilst on his first tour of the West Country in a wheeled carriage. The Rear section of the building is much older, with parts dating from around 900 AD. Some original walls from that time are still to be seen. The pub serves traditional home cooked food and a good selection of ales. They are dog friendly."
