  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the delightful Water Meadows in the Suffolk town of Sudbury. There's some delightful scenery with riverside trails and wild flowers, birds and mammals to look out for on the way. The area has strong connections with the painter Thomas Gainsborough who was born in the town. It forms part of the Gainsborough trail which takes you on a tour of the town, visiting sights connected with the artist. The walk starts from Sudbury Train station and picks up the Valley Trail to take you west to the River Stour and Ballingdon Bridge. The path loops round to the north, crossing the water meadows to Brundon Mill. Here you'll find a row of pretty mill cottages, a weir and numerous swans. After enjoying the picturesque mill the trail turns south to Brundon Lane and King's Marsh, before returning to the train station. There's also waymarked trails to take you through the ancient market town. You can visit the market square where you can see the Thomas Gainsborough statue. His birthplace is now open to the public and has been converted to a museum and art gallery. There's also three medieval churches, Victorian terrace houses, Georgian manor houses and some fine medieval timber framed Halls to see too. Two fine long distance trails pass the town. You could pick up the Stour Valley Path or the St Edmund Way to extend your walking in the area. If you follow the trails north they'll take you up to Melford Hall and Kentwell Hall which are well worth a visit.",

      "content": "The Sudbury Railway Walk starts from the train station and runs along a disused railway line to the river and lakes at Melford Country Park. The flat, easy trail is also suitable for cyclists. A few miles to the south you can visit the worthy village of Bures. The village occupies an interesting spot, straddling the border between Suffolk and Essex. There's also a historic medieval church and a 12th century Motte and Bailey Castle to see here. Just a few miles to the south west there's the noteworthy village of Castle Hedingham. Here you'll find the splendid Hedingham Castle with its significant 12th century Norman Keep, pretty lake and beautiful landscaped gardens. Near here there's also Gosfield Hall and Gosfield Lake where there's some nice waterside trails and a good lakeside cafe. The 16th century hall is designated as a Grade I listed building and is now used for weddings. For more walking ideas in the area see the Suffolk Walks page."
