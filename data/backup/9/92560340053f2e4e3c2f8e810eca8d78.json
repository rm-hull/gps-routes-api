  "description": "This small Chilterns village is located just south of Thame in the county of Oxfordshire. The pretty settlement is known for its historic 14th century church of St Margaret's, it's photogenic old flint cottages and a rather fine 17th century pub. It has been used as a filming location for the popular TV series Midsomer Murders. Local options for walkers include the Aston Rowant Nature Reserve and The Ridgeway National Trail which can be picked up just to the south of the settlement. This circular walk explores the reserve which includes peaceful woodland paths and a hill climb to Beacon Hill. On the way you can look out for a variety of wildlife and enjoy some glorious views of the surrounding Chilterns Hills.",
