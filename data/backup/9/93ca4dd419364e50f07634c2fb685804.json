A few small fields around the hamlet are owned by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty; the Trust rents out several of the stone cottages as self-catering holiday accommodation.Various locations around Port Quin were used in the 1970s by the BBC for filming an adaptation of Winston Graham's Poldark novels."

  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of the South West Coast Path from Polzeath to Port Isaac on the Cornish coast. The walk runs for just under 9 miles along an undulating cliff top path with wonderful views throughout. It's a great area for marine wildlife with dolphins and grey seals to look out for as you make your way along the path. The walk starts from the beach front car park at Polzeath, overlooking Hayle Bay. Follow the waymarked trail north and it will take you around the headland to Pentire Point and Sandinway Beach. You continue east along Port Quin Bay to Carnweather Point and Port Quin. The final section takes you past Kellan Head and Varley Head before finishing in Port Isaac.",
