  "description": "This walk from Bolton Abbey climbs through the Valley of Desolation to Simon's Seat. It's a beautiful, varied walk with waterfalls, rushing becks, heather moorland, woodland trails and spectacular views from the high points. The route is a fairly challenging 3 mile hike to the summit, using a good waymarked path which rises steadily before reaching a peak of 485m (1590ft). The walk starts from the estate car park next to the River Wharfe. Cross the bridge over the river and then turn left to pick up the trail along the Posforth Gill to the Valley of Desolation. You'll pass some pretty waterfalls before heading into the woodland and moorland of the Valley of Desolation. The marked trails then take you along the Great Agill Beck to the interesting rock formations of Truckle Crags. Shortly after you arrive at the 485m peak of Simon's Seat where you can enjoy wonderful views over the countryside of the Yorkshire Dales. To continue your walking in the area you can explore the splendid Bolton Abbey estate. The 12th-century Augustinian\u00a0monastery is surrounded by lovely woodland and parkland. There's also miles of riverside trails with a series of popular stepping stones to try as well. You could also pick up the The Dales Way long distance trail which runs through the abbey estate. Heading north along the path will take you along the river just to the west of the hill.",
