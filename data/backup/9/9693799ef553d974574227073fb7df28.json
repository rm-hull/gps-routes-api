  "description": "This splendid cathedral city is a fine place to explore for walkers. There's some lovely riverside trails, attractive parks and easy access to the local countryside from the city centre. The city is also very close to the Malvern Hills and the Wye Valley AONB where there are numerous walking options through beautiful scenery. This circular riverside walk from the city visits the cathedral and the castle site before following a riverside path into the surrounding countryside. The walk starts at Hereford Cathedral. The historic site dates from the late 11th century and houses a particularly noteworthy chain library. The site also includes a nice cafe and some lovely cathedral gardens. From the cathedral it is a short walk east to visit the site of Hereford Castle. The fortification was one of the earliest castles in England. It was probably destroyed when the Welsh sacked Hereford in 1055, but seems to have been replaced by the following decade. You then cross the river on the Victoria Footbridge and pick up the Wye Valley Walk. Follow the waymarked footpath west along the River Wye and it will take you to a playing field where you cross again. The trail continues west to Lower Breinton, a riverside area run by the National Trust. It's a picturesque area with an old church, pretty orchards and woodlands with bluebells during the spring months. From here you pick up a country lane and follow it east to the old Warham Court where there's an orchard and fields. You continue east past the Broomy Hills Waterworks Museum before returning to the city centre.",

The inn dates from the 18th century and is formed partly from the old city wall. It includes a large, partially covered, walled and flag-stoned brewery yard, providing year-round 'alfresco' drinking. You can find them at 69 Owen's St with a postcode of HR1 2JQ for your sat navs."
