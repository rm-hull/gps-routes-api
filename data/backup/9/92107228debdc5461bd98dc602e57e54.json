  "description": "This splendid Cotswolds village includes a number of picturesque thatched buildings, a photogenic old church and a noteworthy pub dating back to the early 18th century. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring village of Chipping Campden before exploring a lovely section of the Monarch's Way to the south west of the settlement. The walk starts in the village and follows the Monarch's Way north to visit the more well known village of Chipping Campden, crossing the pretty River Cam as you go. Head through the village and you can pick up the Heart of England Way and follow it south towards Briar Hill Farm. The route then head south west through some attractive countryside to Campden Hill Farm before returning to the village.",
