  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll in the woodland, gardens and parkland surrounding this medieval moated manor house near Sevenoaks in Kent. There are three way-marked walks taking you around the gardens and into the wider estate.\nThe 14 acre gardens are a delight with an 18th-century cascade, orchard and an enclosed garden with a fountain. There's also pleasure grounds with a meandering stream, ornamental lake and specimen trees. This walk takes you around the gardens and then into the wider estate using the Greensand Way . You'll head to the nearby Wilmot Hill and then return via Broadhoath wood where there are peaceful woodland trails, a tranquil pond and a pretty stream. Look out for blackcap and buzzards as you make your way through this section. If you'd like to continue your walk you could continue west along the Greensand Way towards the beautiful Knole Park where you will find a deer park, ancient woodland, dry heathland, acid grassland and wood pasture. You can also follow bridleways north and visit the National Trust owned Oldbury Hill where you will find an Iron Age Hillfort, woodland walking paths and mountain bike trails.",
