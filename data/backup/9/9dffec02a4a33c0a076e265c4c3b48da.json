      "caption": "The estuary banks in Fareham stand out as the sole remaining undeveloped areas within the entirety of Portsmouth Harbour. Preserved in their natural state, they boast wooded banks and grasslands, earning designation as a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to their significance for wildlife. Along the trail, visitors can observe a diverse array of bird species, particularly waders. Keep an ear out for the distinctive calls of Oystercatchers and Redshanks, which add a haunting atmosphere to the surroundings. The tidal creek serves as a sanctuary where seabirds coexist with a multitude of modern boats and naval warships."

Recently restored, the Georgian mansion, along with its ancillary buildings and contemporary additions, has been repurposed into the present-day business park. The trail follows the public footpath bordering the golf club, which now occupies much of the former estate's grounds. As you progress along the path, you'll emerge from the surrounding trees and bushes, offering picturesque vistas of the estuary. A modern restaurant, designed to emulate the original water mill, is slated for construction near the bustling Delme roundabout at the estuary's terminus."
