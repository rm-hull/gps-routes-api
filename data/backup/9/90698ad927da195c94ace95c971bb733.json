  "description": "Explore the special scenery of the Hoo Peninsula on this waterside walk in Kent. The path runs along the River Thames estuary with a huge number of wading birds to look out for on the way. It runs for about 18 miles from Gravesend in the west, to the village of Allhallows at the eastern end of the path. On the way you'll pass a series of pretty bays, Cliffe Pools Nature Reserve, Blyth Sands, Halstow Marshes and St Mary's Marshes. The scenery is varied with grazing marsh, intertidal mudflats, saltmarsh and lagoons. To explore the area by bike you can follow the Heron Trail cycle route across the peninsula. Walkers can follow the Saxon Shore Way long distance path. This walk passes the splendid Cliffe Pools nature reserve which is well worth exploring further. It's an RSPB site with a number of lagoons and birds such as lapwings, redshanks, warblers, corn and reed buntings, linnets, stonechats and skylarks to look out for.",

      "content": "The Three Daws in Gravesend is well worthy of some investigation. The historic riverside inn dates back to the 1400s, making it one of the oldest in the country. As such it's steeped with tales of smugglers, Press Gangs, hauntings and the like. It would have been a popular haunt for seamen as at one time large sailing merchant ships used to anchor off the Three Daws. Today you can enjoy lovely British food in the garden area overlooking the River Thames. It's a splendid spot to relax in on warmer days. You can find them at the start of the walk at the Town Pier with a postcode of DA11 0BJ for your sat navs."
