  "description": "This short walk takes you from the village of Killin to the beautiful Falls of Dochart. You start in the village centre and follow a footpath through the town and along the River Dochart to the falls. It's a lovely setting with the white water crashing against rocks and flowing around the pretty Islands of Inchbuie.  The river is surrounded by attractive woodland, with the lovely backdrop of the Highland Mountains. You can also visit the old watermill and cross the pretty little bridge over the river for even better views in both directions. The Falls are located at the western end of Loch Tay so it's easy to extend your walk and visit the loch from Killin. The long distance Rob Roy Way walk also runs past the falls so you could pick this up to extend your outing.",
