  "description": "Explore the 700 acre estate of this Grade I listed building in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire. In the park you will pass lakes, a walled garden and a woodland area. Also look out for the many resident deer and peacocks. The park is located on the edge of the Cotswold escarpment so there are fantastic views of the Cotswold AONB. It is extensive and there are many well signed footpaths to enjoy. The house dates from the 16th century and includes unique stained glass windows and a beautiful dining room with William Morris wallpaper. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the circular walk around Wotton-under-Edge which uses part of the Cotswold Way .",

The Grade I listed manor house dates back to the 16th century and is surrounded by some pretty gardens. In the area there's also a historic 400 year old pub and the Somerset Monument to visit. Also south of Wotton-Under-Edge there's Kingswood where you could visit the 15th century Abbey Gatehouse. The historic site is owned by English Heritage and is all that survives of the former Cistercian abbey."
