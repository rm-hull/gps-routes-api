  "description": "Explore the 700 acre estate of this Grade I listed building in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire. In the park you will pass lakes, a walled garden and a woodland area. Also look out for the many resident deer and peacocks. The park is located on the edge of the Cotswold escarpment so there are fantastic views of the Cotswold AONB. It is extensive and there are many well signed footpaths to enjoy. The house dates from the 16th century and includes unique stained glass windows and a beautiful dining room with William Morris wallpaper. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the circular walk around Wotton-under-Edge which uses part of the Cotswold Way .",
