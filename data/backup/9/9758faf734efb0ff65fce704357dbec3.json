  "description": "This circular walk follows the waterside footpath around Turton and Entwistle Reservoir near Bolton in Lancashire. The walk starts from the car park at the eastern end of the reservoir but you could also start from the nearby Entwistsle railway station. Trains run to Entwistle from Manchester, Blackburn and Clitheroe. There is a good, well surfaced footpath around the reservoir, running for about 2.5 miles. It's a popular place for walkers with the beautiful still waters surrounded by attractive conifer trees. After your walk you can treat yourself to refreshments at the excellent Strawberry Duck pub located to the east of the reservoir, near the train station. It's easy to extend your walk by picking up the Witton Weavers Way and following it south to the lovely Jumbles Country Park via Wayoh Reservoir .",

There's an appealing interior with old beams, an open fire, numerous pictures on the wall, comfy chairs & a cosy, welcoming atmosphere. Outside there's a nice beer garden for warmer days. You can find it close to the train station on Overshores Rd with a postcode of BL7 0LU for your sat navs.  Pictured above are the Strawbury Duck Pub and the adjacent Wayoh Reservoir. A visit to both is a nice idea after your exercise."
