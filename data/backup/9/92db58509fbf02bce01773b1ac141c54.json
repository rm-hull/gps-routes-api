  "description": "This pretty Yorkshire village is located just to the north of Leeds city centre. It's an attractive village with some of the most expensive houses in the area. This circular walk from the settlement visits two of the local highlights at Eccup Reservoir and the Golden Acre Park. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths east along the Ebor Way to Arthington Quarry and Bank Top Lane. At Bank Side you head south along the Dales Way to Bowshaws Ash Hill and Eccup Reservoir. There's a nice circular trail to follow around the lake and woodland here. The walk then heads west along the Leeds Country Way to visit Golden Acre Park. There's well laid out footpaths taking you around lakes, woodland and gardens in this popular park on the outskirts of Leeds. From the park you continue west to Crag Hill before turning north east past Bramhope Moor to return to the village. To extend the walk head west along the Ebor Way to visit the popular Otley Chevin Country Park where you can enjoy fine views from the hill top at The Chevin.",
