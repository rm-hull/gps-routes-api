  "description": "This walk takes you through the beautiful Marlborough Downs in Wiltshire. You will pass Pewsey Downs, Milk Hill, Tan Hill and Morgan's Hill with fabulous views of the surrounding countryside for the duration of the walk. The start point of the walk is the car park at Clench Common with the finish at Morgan's Hill which is also a nature reserve of the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust. The route passes close to the Milk Hill summit which is the highest point of Wiltshire. You can take a small detour from the path to reach the summit. Here you can enjoy extensive views to the Mendip Hills, the Cotswolds and in clear weather as far as the Black Mountains in Wales. In this area you will also pass the noteworthy Alton Barnes White Horse hill figure. The walk also passes along a section of the Wansdyke Path which offers an alternative route for exploring the area.",

This historic pub is located right next to the canal and includes an outdoor seating area wih glorious views across the canal to the Marlborough Downs and the Alton Barnes White Horse. It's the ideal place to relax in and watch the world go by on warm summer days. The pub also has an interesting history having originally been built in 1810 to service the newly built Kennet and Avon canal, it was the equivalent of a modern day motorway service station. It then burnt down in the 1850s only to be rebuilt in record time so it now stands as it did then. The pub can be found just to the west of Pewsey in Honeystreet, near Alton Barnes. Postcode for you sat navs is SN9 5PS."
