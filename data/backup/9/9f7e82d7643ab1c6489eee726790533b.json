  "description": "This walk takes you along the Jurassic Coast from Lyme Regis to West Bay. It runs for just over 8 miles and uses public footpaths and the waymarked South West Coast Path. Along the way there's lovely beaches, pretty coastal villages and wonderful views from the cliff top paths. The walk starts in Lyme Regis and heads east along the beach towards Charmouth. It's advisable to check the tide times for this section as if it is high tide you will need to take the South West Coast path trail above the beach. From Charmouth you continue east to Cain's Folly, Broom Cliff and the Golden Cap Estate. This area is one of the highlights of the south coast with breathtaking views from the elevated position of the Cap. After descending the hill you continue east past Chideock, Seatown, Thorncombe Beacon, East Ebb Cove and Lower Eype before finishing at West Bay. It's a very picturesque spot sited at the mouth of the River Brit just south of the town of Bridport. You may recognise the scenery in the area as some of the ITV drama \"Broadchurch\" was filmed here.",

      "content": "On the walk you could stop off at the Beach Cafe at Charmouth. There's a good range of meals, snacks and locally made cakes. Next to the cafe there's also the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre where you can see a wonderful fossil collection including an ichthyosaur that starred in the BBC documentary \u2018Attenborough and the Sea Dragon\u2019. There's also guided fossil hunting walks to try here.At West Bay at the end of the route you can reward yourself with some refreshments at The George. The pub is in a great location on the harbour and includes a riverside terrace for warmer days. It's also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you. You can find it at 18 George Street with a postcode of DT6 4HA for your sat navs."

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the Circular Walk from West Bay and visit the nearby village of Burton Bradstock. You can also pick up the Chesil Beach Walk near here. Head a few miles inland and you could try the National Trust's Lamberts Castle to Coneys Castle Walk. The walk visits historic old hill forts where you can enjoy some stunning views over the countryside of the Marshwood Vale. Near Bridport there's the climb to the lovely viewpoint at Colmers Hill from the picturesque village of Symondsbury. The historic village includes an ancient church and a noteworthy 15th century, thatched pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dorset Walks page."
