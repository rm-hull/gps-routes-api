  "description": "This walk takes you along the Jurassic Coast from Lyme Regis to West Bay. It runs for just over 8 miles and uses public footpaths and the waymarked South West Coast Path. Along the way there's lovely beaches, pretty coastal villages and wonderful views from the cliff top paths. The walk starts in Lyme Regis and heads east along the beach towards Charmouth. It's advisable to check the tide times for this section as if it is high tide you will need to take the South West Coast path trail above the beach. From Charmouth you continue east to Cain's Folly, Broom Cliff and the Golden Cap Estate. This area is one of the highlights of the south coast with breathtaking views from the elevated position of the Cap. After descending the hill you continue east past Chideock, Seatown, Thorncombe Beacon, East Ebb Cove and Lower Eype before finishing at West Bay. It's a very picturesque spot sited at the mouth of the River Brit just south of the town of Bridport. You may recognise the scenery in the area as some of the ITV drama \"Broadchurch\" was filmed here.",
