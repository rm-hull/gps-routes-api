  "description": "This double looped trail travels through the area associated with the Pendle Witch Trials of 1612. During the trial twelve people from the area were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft. Ten were subsequently found guilty and executed by hanging. The walk visits several local landmarks connected to the accused, while also exposing you to some lovely Lancashire scenery along the way. There's waterside sections along rivers and reservoirs with fine views of the surrounding Forest of Bowland hills to enjoy too. The walk starts from the car park and visitor centre in the village of Barley. Follow footpaths south to Newchurch where the Demdike family of Pendle Witches lived in the 17th century. The route continues past Faugh's Quarry where Demdike claimed to have met the devil who promised her that she could have anything she desired in return for her soul. Follow Well Head Road west before turning north on a footpath to the Ogden Reservoirs. Here the trail turns east along the lower reservoir back to Barley where you can begin the eastern loop of the trail. This starts by following White Hough Water east to Slacks Wood and Offa Hill. The route then turns south to the pretty village of Roughlee where another of the accused lived. You then pick up country lanes to take you past a waterfall to Thorney Holme. Here you pick up Hays Lane which takes you past Boothman Wood before returning you to Barley. In the village you can enjoy refreshments at the Pendle Inn which has a great menu and is very popular with weary walkers. To continue your walking in the area you could climb to Pendle Hill for fabulous views over the Pennines to the east, the Bowland Fells to the northwest, and the West Pennine Moors to the south. Other options include the long distance Pendle Way and the pretty Black Moss Reservoir which lies just to the north of Barley.",
