  "description": "This walk explores Clifton Down and Durdham Down next to the Avon Gorge in Bristol. The Bristol Downs are a popular place for walkers and runners with nice footpaths, woodland trails and panoramic views of the Avon Gorge and the Clifton Suspension Bridge. It's a great area for birdwatching with 65 species to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for jays, great tits, song thrush and bullfinch. In the summer months the meadows and grassland are covered in pretty wildflowers which attract butterflies including small skipper, comma, orange-tip and gatekeeper. There's also a nice tree trail with hornbeam, lime, monkey puzzle and sycamore trees. The trees are numbered with discs so you can easily identify them. The downs are on the opposite side of the river to Leigh Woods where you will find miles of cycling and walking trails through the attractive woodland. The Bristol Triangular City Walk passes over the downs, so you could pick this up to extend your walk. The River Avon Trail also passes the downs. Pick up this long distance trail to explore the course of the river.",
