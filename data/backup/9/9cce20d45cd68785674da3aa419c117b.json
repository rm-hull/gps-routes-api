  "description": "This walk takes you around the beautiful Regent's Park in North London. There's 395 acres to explore with highlights including the stunning Queen Mary's Gardens which features 400 varieties of roses and a lovely waterfall. Stroll down long wide footpaths lined with pretty flowers and dotted with beautiful statues and fountains. There's also a large boating lake and the famous zoo to visit. You can extend the walk by crossing the Regent's Canal and climbing Primrose Hill for great views over the city. The waymarked 60km Jubilee Greenway also passes through the park so you could pick this up to explore the capital further. Cyclists can pass through the northern end of the park along the canal. You can virtually explore the park using the google street view link below!",
