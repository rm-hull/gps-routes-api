    "description": "This large country park in Bolton covers 750 acres and includes a number of splendid cycling and walking trails. The River Croal and River Irwell run through the park and there are 3 pretty lakes, so there is some lovely waterside walking and cycling to enjoy.

The park is located just a few miles south of Bolton next to Moses Gate train station. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head a couple of miles south and visit Blackleach Country Park.
