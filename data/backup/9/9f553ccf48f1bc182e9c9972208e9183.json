  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Loch Ashie in the Scottish Highlands. There's a quiet road on the western side of the loch where you can enjoy fine views across the water to the surrounding hills. In this area you can also see pretty heather in late summer. There is a small roadside parking area at the southern side of the loch where you can start your walk. Wildlife Information : Loch Ashie is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its status as the foremost location in Britain for the congregation of Slavonian grebes both before and after their breeding season. The highest numbers of these grebes are observed during the autumn months, coinciding with their moulting period when they temporarily lose the ability to fly. Remarkably, the flocks gathered at Loch Ashie account for approximately 10% of the UK's total population of Slavonian grebes. The loch is located very close to Loch Ness and Loch Duntelchaig so you can continue your walking here.",
