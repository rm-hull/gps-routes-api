The medieval ruins of the castle stand on a rocky summit 500ft above the Cheshire plain, offering views from the Pennines in the east to the mountains of Wales in the west. It dates from 1225 when it was built by Ranulf, the sixth Earl of Chester, and contains one of the deepest castle wells in the country. It was seized by King Henry III in 1237 and used by him and later his son, King Edward I, as a base for their campaigns against the Welsh. The castle was finally destroyed at the end of the Civil War."

  "description": "Travel through Cheshire and Staffordshire on this wonderful long distance walking trail. The 92 mile pilgrimage route runs from Chester to Lichfield, passing through Nantwich, Stoke-on-Trent and Stafford. It is named after the saints St Werburgh and St Chad, Saxon saints who brought Christianity from Northumbria to the ancient kingdom of Mercia in the seventh century. It runs between St Werburgh's shrine at Chester to St Chad's shrine at Lichfield. The route is typically completed in the following four sections: Chester to Nantwich The route starts at Chester Cathedral and heads through the town, passing the Roman amphitheatre and the pilgrim church of St John's. You then pick up the Shropshire Union Canal passing along the towpath on the Baker Way. You'll pass Waverton, Beeston Castle, Bunbury, the River Gowy, Barbridge and Hurleston Reservoir before arriving at St Mary's Church in the market town of Nantwich. Nantwich to Stoke-on-Trent You leave Nantwich, heading south along the River Weaver, before turning east towards the village of Wynbunbury and the Wynbunbury Moss Nature Reserve. You continue through Weston, Barthomley and Newcastle-under-Lyme where you skirt the edge of the pretty Apedale Country Park . The last section takes you through Stoke-on-Trent, passing Westport Lake before coming to the halfway point of the trail at Stoke Minster, with its Saxon preaching cross. Stoke-on-Trent to Stafford You leave Stoke, heading south towards the beautiful Trentham Gardens with a section along the Trent and Mersey Canal. You continue through the lovely Trent Valley passing Tittensor Chase, Stone and Hopton before coming into Stafford. There's some nice sections along the River Trent on this leg of the journey. You finish at St Chad's, the oldest church in the county town of Stafford. Stafford to Lichfield The route then follows the River Sow out of Stafford, joining the Heart of England Way at Milford where you pass Shugborough Park and cross the Cannock Chase AONB. It's a lovely section, passing through Cannock Chase Country Park where you will visit the Katyn Memorial and Castle Ring hill fort. The final section takes you through farmland around Chorley before reaching Lichfield and the pilgrim sites at the cathedral and St Chad's Well.",
