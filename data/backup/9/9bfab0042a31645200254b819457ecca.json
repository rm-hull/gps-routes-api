  "description": "Explore the Elizabethan town walls of Berwick-Upon-Tweed on this interesting circular walk. The easy walk runs for just over a mile so should suit most abilities. Along the way there's nice views of the River Tweed, the Royal Tweed Bridge and the impressive Royal Border Bridge, part of the East Coast Main Line. Other highlights include a number of Bastions (forts) and the Bell Tower which was built in 1577. The route starts at the Cumberland Bastion at the northern end of the Northumberland based town. The path then heads east to the Brass Bastion and the 15th century Church of the Holy Trinity on the north eastern corner of the walls. You then turn south along the eastern portion, passing the Windmill Bastion on the way. The walls then head west along the River Tweed Estuary to Coxon's tower, set photogenically next to the river at the south western corner. The route turns north here, passing along the river quay to Megs Mount at the north western end. From here it is a short stroll back to the Cumberland Bastion where the route finishes. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the Berwickshire Coastal Path which starts in the town. Follow the waymarked path north and you can visit the lovely Marshall Meadows Bay.",
