  "description": "This walk takes you from Selsey to West Wittering via Bracklesham Bay. It's about a 10 mile walk following the shingle beach west before heading inland through the countryside. You'll pass the RSPB Medmerry Nature Reserve before returning to the coast at Bracklesham Bay. The reserve's habitats include mudflats and saltmarsh with a large variety of wildlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for lapwing and avocet around the pretty lagoons. From Bracklesham you head west along the beach to East Wittering before finishing at West Wittering. Here you can continue your exercise on the West Wittering and East Head Walk which will take you to the National Trust owned East Head.",
