    "description": "This seaside town is located between Prestatyn and Abergele on the North Wales coast. The North Wales Path runs through the town, providing an opportunity to follow a waymarked trail along the coast. Heading west would take you towards Abergele where you could visit Gwrych Castle which became famous in 2020 when it was used as the setting for the 20th series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! The town is also located near the Clwydian Range where there are some challenging hill climbs to try. This circular walk uses a section of the North Wales Path to visit some of the highlights of the area. The walk starts on the sea front and follows the trail west to Rhyl's Marine Lake. Here you turn inland and follow a nice riverside trail along the River Clwyd to neighbouring Rhuddlan. The walk continues east to Dyserth where you can visit a series of picturesque waterfalls. Features include wonderful 70ft high falls, caves, streams and pleasant woodland trails. From Dyserth you continue north to Prestatyn, climbing the excellent viewpoint at Graig Fawr on the way. The final section takes you west along the coast and Ffrith beach from Prestatyn to Rhyll.",
