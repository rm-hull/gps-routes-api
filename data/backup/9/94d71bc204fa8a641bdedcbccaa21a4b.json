  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful 300-metre natural rock gorge at the Linn of Dee in the Cairngorms. The walk starts at the Linn of Dee car park (postcode below is approximate) and takes you through woodland to the bridge over the River Dee. The Dee is a popular salmon river with a ladder by the waterfall where the fish have the chance to swim upstream to spawn. It's a lovely spot with the rushing water, pine woodland, the old stone bridge and the rocky gorge. The walk then heads north through Glen Lui along Lui Water to Derry Lodge. This Victorian building was used as a base for shooting parties but is now disused. You can then continue along the pretty Derry Burn with lovely woodland trails and fabulous views of the Cairngorm mountains. The footpaths for most of the walk are very good. You can continue your walking in this beautiful area by heading a few miles along the road to the east where you will find the splendid Linn of Quoich .",
