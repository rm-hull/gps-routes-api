  "description": "This pretty village is surrounded by some lovely Oxfordshire countryside and is only a short walk from the River Thames. This circular walk takes you through the farmland to the south of the village, following footpaths to the river and Bampton Lock. The walk starts in the village and heads south west toward Weald before turning south east to pass RAF Bampton Castle, a former non-flying Royal Air Force station. Continue south and you will soon come to the river at Rushey Lock where you can pick up the Thames Path. The lock was built in stone in 1790 by the Thames Navigation Commission. The weir is adjacent to the lock on the other side of the lock island. Cross the river here and then you can head west along the river path to Old Man's Bridge. The footbridge will take you to the northern side of the Thames where you can follow country lanes north, crossing the Sharney Brook before coming back into Bampton. To extend your walking in the area head west along the river to Lechlade and Fairford to visit the splendid Cotswold Water Park. Heading east will take you Farmoor Reservoir where there's a nice footpath to follow around the water. You can also visit the historic market town of Eynsham in this area.",
