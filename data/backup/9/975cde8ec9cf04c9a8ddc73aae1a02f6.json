Features on the common include eight veteran Spanish sweet chestnut trees, two early Bronze Age burial mounds and the Apostles Pond which is surrounded by willow trees. You can start your walk from the car park at the northern end of the site. From here you can pick up a network of paths taking you across the common. After your walk you can enjoy a stroll around the pretty village of Chipperfield with its nice pubs, cricket pavilion, war memorial, village green and old churches. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up the Grand Union Canal towards Hemel Hempstead or Watford. The Chess Valley Walk also passes to the south of Chipperfield, near Sarrat and Chenies.",
