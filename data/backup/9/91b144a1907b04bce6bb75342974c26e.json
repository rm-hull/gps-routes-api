The Howe and the edge of Black Hill is immediately ahead and to the distant left is the outline of Hare Hill NT 171 619. The road - really a steep and rough track - ascends Scald Law from here and can be followed all the way across the hills to Silverburn and Penicuik NT 235 606. In Victorian times, parishioners from the area would walk this track to attend the Kirk, there being no Sunday service nearer to home."
