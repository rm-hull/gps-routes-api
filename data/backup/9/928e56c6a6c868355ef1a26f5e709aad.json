  "description": "This beautiful, challenging walk runs through the Peak District from Disley to Kidsgrove. The walk begins at the train station at Disley and soon comes to the wonderful Lyme Park (video below) with its mansion house and Medieval deer park. You continue south passing the town of Bollington before climbing to the unusual structure of White Nancy and crossing the Saddle of Kerridge. From the elevated position above Bollington you can enjoy splendid views across the Cheshire Plain, the mountains of North Wales to the west, the hills of Shropshire to the south and the Pennines to the north and east. The route continues to the lovely Tegg's Nose Country Park via Tower Hill. The views are truly dramatic from this former quarry site, including Shutlingsloe , the second highest point in Cheshire. The next section takes you on towards Rushton Bank before climbing the Bosley Cloud - at 1,125 ft it's a challenging section but the views of Congleton , Macclesfield and Greater Manchester are magnificent. The path continues to Mow Cop with its ruined castle, before you join the Macclesfield Canal and then the Trent and Mersey Canal taking you to Kidsgrove.",
