Ducks (like wigeon) were corralled into the covered inlets on the decoy ponds, caught there, killed, and then sent to the London markets."

  "description": "This Essex based village has some lovely river and country trails to try. There's also a 14th century pub and a noteworthy Norman church to see in the village. This circular walk from the village explores the Goldhanger Creek on the Blackwater Estuary. The area is great for bird watching so be sure to bring your binoculars with you. The route starts in the village and then follows a footpath south down to the river where there's nice views over Goldhanger Creek to Osea Island. The sea wall footpath then heads east past Gore Saltings to Rolls Farm where you leave the river and turn north along Prentice Hall Lane. You could take a small detour here to visit the village of Tollesbury which lies just to the north east. This route follows a country trail west past Wycke Farm and Joyce's Farm to return to Goldhanger.",
