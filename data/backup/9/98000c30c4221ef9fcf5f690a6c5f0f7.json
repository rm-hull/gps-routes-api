  "description": "This Suffolk based village is regarded as one of the most picturesque villages in East Anglia. A stroll around the village is a real delight and it is also surrounded by some attractive countryside. This circular walk from Kersey explores the countryside to the west of the village around Lindsey. In the village you'll pass the famous Water Splash which runs across its main street and is one of the county\u2019s most documented scenes. There's also a number of delightful cottages, some of which date from the medieval period. The church dates from the 12th century and is also worthy of some investigation. The walk starts in the village and follows public footpaths north west through the countryside to Lindsey. There's a 14th century church, a fine pub and more pretty cottages in this small village. Also of interest is St James's Chapel, a 13th-century thatched chapel under the protection of English Heritage. After exploring the village you then head south to Lindsey Hall and Lindsey Castle before coming to Bridges Farm near Kersey Tye. Here you turn north east to follow footpaths back into the village.",

Outside there's a lovely garden area to relax in if the sun is shining. They do very good food and have a fine selection of ales too. You can find the pub at postcode IP7 6DY for your sat navs. If you fancy a break on the route then stop off at the Lindsey Rose in Lindsey. It's another splendid old village pub dating back over 500 years. There's an open log fire, some fine cask ales and a garden area too. You can find it at The Tye, Lindsey, IP7 6PP."

      "content": "Kersey is located just a couple of miles north west of Hadleigh where you can enjoy trails along the River Brett and pick up the Hadleigh Railway Walk. This shared cycling and walking trail takes you along the trackbed of the old Hadleigh Railway line from Hadleigh to Raydon Wood railway station. Near here you can also visit the wildlife rich Wolves Wood which is owned by the RSPB. A few miles north west there's another pretty Suffolk village at Lavenham where you can try the Lavenham Circular Walk. Just to the south there's the Dedham Vale AONB where there's some wonderful scenery. Here you can try the Dedham to Flatford Walk and visit Flatford Mill, the site of Constable's most famous painting. His birthplace at East Bergholt is also nearby and well worth visiting. You can pick up the Stour Valley Path in this area and enjoy riverside trails. The village is not from Ipswich where there's nice trails to try along the River Orwell and the River Gipping. For more walking ideas in the area see the Suffolk Walks page."
