  "description": "This Suffolk based village is regarded as one of the most picturesque villages in East Anglia. A stroll around the village is a real delight and it is also surrounded by some attractive countryside. This circular walk from Kersey explores the countryside to the west of the village around Lindsey. In the village you'll pass the famous Water Splash which runs across its main street and is one of the county\u2019s most documented scenes. There's also a number of delightful cottages, some of which date from the medieval period. The church dates from the 12th century and is also worthy of some investigation. The walk starts in the village and follows public footpaths north west through the countryside to Lindsey. There's a 14th century church, a fine pub and more pretty cottages in this small village. Also of interest is St James's Chapel, a 13th-century thatched chapel under the protection of English Heritage. After exploring the village you then head south to Lindsey Hall and Lindsey Castle before coming to Bridges Farm near Kersey Tye. Here you turn north east to follow footpaths back into the village.",
