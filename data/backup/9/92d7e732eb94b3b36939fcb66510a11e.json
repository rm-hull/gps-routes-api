These are the remains of a stone wall just below the summit. This is a very large hill fort and one of the highest in England. The spread of stones reminds me of the forts in Scotland rather than the usual earthen ramparts found on other local forts. This side of the hill is undisturbed, beyond the summit much of the hill has been quarried away."

  "description": "Visit Titterstone Clee Hill and Brown Clee Hill on this challenging walk in the Shropshire Hills AONB. Titterstone Clee stands at a height of 1,749 feet (533 m) while Brown Clee at 1,772 feet (540 m), is the highest peak in Shropshire. The views from the hills are truly wonderful with the Welsh Mountains of Snowdonia, Cadair Idris, the Brecon Beacons, and the Black Mountains visible. There are fine views across the Shropshire Hills AONB including Long Mynd, Caer Caradoc and Stiperstones are also marvellous. To the south are the Malvern Hills and the Cotswolds, and to the east are the Clent Hills, Turner's Hill, and Barr Beacon. To the north is Cannock Chase and the Peak District including The Roaches and Winter Hill. This walk starts at the car park at Titterstone Clee Hill and follows the Shropshire Way 5 miles north to Brown Clee Hill. Look out for a variety of wildlife including rabbits, adders, peregrine, kestrel, skylark, Eurasian curlew and barn owl often scene on the hills. If you'd like to extend this walk you could start it from the nearby town of Ludlow and follow the Shropshire Way to Titterstone Hill.",
