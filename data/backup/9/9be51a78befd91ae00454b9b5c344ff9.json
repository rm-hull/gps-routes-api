  "description": "This riverside Lincolnshire village sits in a peaceful rural spot near Horncastle, Woodhall Spa and Coningsby. It's an interesting place with riverside trails, a noteworthy 16th century pub and an ancient church dating from the Norman period. This pleasant waterside walk from the village takes you north along the River Bain to the neighbouring village of Roughton via Haltham. It's an attractive riverside path, passing the disused Haltham Lock and a weir on the old Horncastle Canal. There's good views of the surrounding countryside to enjoy as well. To extend the walk continue north to visit Horncastle. In this area you can also pick up the Viking Way long distance trail and follow it south west towards Woodhall Spa .",
