  "description": "Explore the extensive grounds and beautiful gardens of this historic house in Perthshire. Highlights include a wonderful maze with 2000 beech trees, the Kitchen Garden with pathways through the vegetable and cut flower beds and Moot Hill with its wide lawns and tiny Presbyterian Chapel. You can also enjoy a peaceful riverside stroll along the River Tay which runs through the park. The palace itself is well worth a visit with its grand state rooms containing porcelain, ivories, clocks, furniture, paintings and other family heirlooms. Scone palace is located less than two miles north of the centre of Perth. If you are coming from this direction you can follow the riverside walking and cycling path along the Tay from Perth to the palace. To continue your walking around the Perth area head to the nearby Moncrieffe Hill. This large area of woodland has miles of waymarked trails, hill climbs with viewpoints, a sculpture trail and lots of wildlife to see.",
