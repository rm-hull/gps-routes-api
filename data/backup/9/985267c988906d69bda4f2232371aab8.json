There's also some fine coastal walks at Abergele where you can visit the woodland and viewpoint at Gwrych Castle. The Grade I listed castle became famous in 2020 when it was used as the setting for the 20th series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! On the western side of Gwrych Castle there's the small village of Rhyd y Foel where you can enjoy a climb to the Pen y Corddyn Mawr hill fort. There's photogenic limestone scenery and more fine views over the River Dulas valley from this interesting ancient site."
