  "description": "This country park in Dartmoor consists of woodland trails, beautiful lakes and the stunning Canonteign Falls. The walk takes you through a beautiful wooded valley with babbling streams, tumbling waterfalls and pretty wooden bridges. The paths lead you to the spectacular 220 feet (70m) high Canonteign Falls which is one of the highest in England. Other features in the park include a Victorian Fern Garden and a Secret Garden, 7 tranquil lakes and a children's play area with a 30m zip wire. The park is great for wildlife with a variety of birds in the woodland and black swans on the lakes. Canonteign Falls is located just to the north of Bovey Tracey, not far from Exeter. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Trenchford and Tottiford Reservoirs for a lovely waterside trail. Also nearby is Kennick Reservoir where there's more peaceful footpaths to try.",
