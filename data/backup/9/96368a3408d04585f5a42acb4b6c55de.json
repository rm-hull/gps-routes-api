  "description": "This Somerset seaside resort has some fine coastal walking, a large area of local woodland, some fine hill climbs and a nature reserve with lots of coastal wildlife to see. This walk from the town visits two of the walking highlights of the area at Sand Point and Weston Woods. There's also some history with a visit to an ancient priory located near to the town. The walk starts at the Grand Pier on the sea front and follows the coastal path north past the Marine Lake and Birnbeck Island. You continue north along Sand Bay, passing the village of Kewstoke before arriving at Sand Point and Middle Point. The beautiful peninsula is a fine place for a walk with lots of wildlife and fine views over the Bristol Channel to Wales. The route also takes you east through the reserve to visit the 13th century Woodspring Priory. After exploring the reserve and the priory you head south to follow footpaths through the countryside on the northern side of the town. These will lead you back to Kewstoke where you enter Weston Woods. There's some peaceful woodland trails here, taking you to Worlebury Hill before returning to the coast path. You can then follow this back into Weston-Super-Mare.",

There's a lovely terrace area where you can enjoy a drink with sea views. They also do a fine Sunday roast if you are feeling peckish. You can find them on 51 Birnbeck Road with a postcode of BS23 2EF for your sat navs."

A few miles south east of the town there's another fine viewpoint to be found on Bleadon Hill. Just to the south is the delightful Uphill Nature Reserve. The reserve is well worth exploring with great views from the high point at Uphill Beacon and lots of interesting flora and fauna. The reserve is located in the neighbouring village of Uphill which also includes an elevated church and the remains of the old windmill. For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks and Mendip Hills Walks pages."
