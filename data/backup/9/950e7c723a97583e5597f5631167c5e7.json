  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Longbridge Mill in Sherfield on Loddon in Hampshire. The old pub is a nice place for a meal and a stroll along the River Loddon. The mill dates back to the 15th century and includes a granary which was added in the 16th century. At its peak, 'Lodgridge Mill' at 'Shirefield-upon-Loddon,' was a major industry in the area with two water-wheels powering four sets of milling stones. The site also has a working flour mill and visitor centre to explore. There's a nice garden area to relax with a drink or a meal too. After exploring the mill head west into the village where there's a pretty village green and a nice pub. If you cross to the other side of the river there's a footpath heading along the Brenda Parker Way past Hartley Wespall Wood Common.",

      "content": "Head south west and you could visit the historic Old Basing. Here you'll find the 16th century Basing House, a Tudor Tithe Barn, Basingstoke Common and the Basing Lime Pits. There's also some more nice trails along the River Loddon in this area. Just south of Old Basing there's Hackwood Park to explore. The Grade I listed park has a series of public footpaths taking you past the old estate which includes an ornamental bridge, fountains, a statue of George I, deer and the impressive Hackwood House. Just to the east of the park you can pick up the circular Mapledurwell Walk and visit the pretty villages of Mapledurwell and Upton Grey. Just to the south you can pick up the Basingstoke Canal Walk at Up Nately. If you follow it east you could visit another historical highlight of the area at Odiham Castle. Here you can pick up the Three Castles Path. This historically themed long distance trail will take you from Windsor Castle to Winchester Castle, visiting the canal and Odiham Castle on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
