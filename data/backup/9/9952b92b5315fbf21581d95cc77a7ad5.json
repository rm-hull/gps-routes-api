  "description": "This short circular walk explores the area around the little village of Aveton Gifford in Devon. It's a pleasant place for a walk with easy waterside paths along the River Avon Estuary and a little creek that runs off to the north. There's also a noteworthy 13th century church and a fine local pub for rest and refreshment after your exercise. The route starts from the village car park and uses part of the Avon Estuary Walk and other public footpaths to explore the area. To extend the walk head a couple of miles east to neighbouring Loddiswell. Here you visit the old railway station, explore the 14th century church and enjoy more pleasant riverside trails.",
