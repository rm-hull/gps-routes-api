  "description": "This walk follows a lovely section of the West Highland Way from Rowardennan to Inversnaid in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The route runs for about 7 miles, following the waymarked footpath north along the loch. On the way there are some small climbs, large expanses of woodland and fine views over the loch. You can extend the walk by visiting Inversnaid Falls and the Inversnaid Nature Trail . The picturesque falls are located just to the east of the hotel at the end of the walk. In Inversnaid you can also pick up the Waterbus to Inveruglas or Tarbet. The route links with the previous stage of the West Highland Way on the Balmaha to Milarrochy Bay and Rowardennan Walk . This takes you south to the beautiful Milarrochy Bay and the village of Balmaha where you can explore the wildlife rich Balmaha Forest . The next stage is on the Inversnaid to Tyndrum Walk which takes you through Glen Falloch to Crianlarich and Tyndrum.",
