  "description": "This circular walk explores the expansive Dyfnant Forest, located just to the south of the famous Lake Vyrnwy. The forest is also good for mountain biking with a number of bridleways and off road tracks to try. You can start the walk at the car park at the southern end of the lake. From here you can pick up the Glyndwr's Way and follow the waymarked trail south into the forest. Here you can explore the woods on a number of different footpaths and bridleways. On the way you'll enjoy attractive coniferous trees and a number of pretty streams. The woods are also surrounded by some lovely lush green countryside. To continue your walking in the area head to the northern end of the lake and visit the picturesque Rhiwargor Waterfall .",
