At these times the males gather at the edge of shallow pools in the dune slacks and sing to attract a mate."

  "description": "Explore the beaches, sand dunes and woodland in this beautiful nature reserve in Formby. The area is famous for its wildlife with the Natterjack Toad and the Red Squirrel the major highlights. The area is run by the National Trust so you will find a series of well laid out footpaths and waymarked trails. There is a squirrel trail through the lovely pine woodlands where you can look out for the growing population of red squirrels. There's also an asparagus trail where you can learn about Formby's asparagus heritage. This trail passes through farmland with Hebridean and Herdwick sheep. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Sefton Coastal Footpath which runs past the site.",

You'll also pass the Royal Birkdale Golf Club before coming to the popular town of Southport. If you head south you can visit Crosby and see the fascinating Another Place Sculptures on Crosby Beach. The Anthony Gormley piece was created in 1997, and consists of 100 cast iron figures facing towards the sea. To the east you can pick up the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and enjoy a walk around Maghull to the Lunt Meadows Nature Reserve. For more walking ideas in the area see the Merseyside Walks page."
