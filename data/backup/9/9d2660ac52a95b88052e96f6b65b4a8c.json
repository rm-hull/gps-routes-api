  "description": "This walk and cycle trail runs from the outskirts of Northampton to Market Harborough along the trackbed of a disused railway line and National Cycle Route 6. The route passes Brixworth, Maidwell and Great Oxendon with the popular Brixworth Country Park just off the route. This is well worth a small detour as you will find the lovely Pitsford Reservoir which has a fine waterside cycling and walking trail to try. Cycles can also be hired here at the Brixworth visitor centre. As well as the beautiful rural scenery you will also pass Northampton & Lamport Railway with its old steam railway on this pleasant trail.",

      "content": "Just to the west of the route start you could try the Harlestone Firs Forest Walk. This popular woodland area contains miles of peaceful trails on Lord Spencer's Althorp Estate. Near the woods you can also visit Althorp House, the childhood home of Princess Diana. Here you can learn about 500 years of history and explore the beautiful grounds and gardens. The woods and house are located just over a mile west from the start of the trail and well worth a small detour. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks and the Northamptonshire Walks pages."
