  "description": "This walk and cycle trail runs from the outskirts of Northampton to Market Harborough along the trackbed of a disused railway line and National Cycle Route 6 . The route passes Brixworth, Maidwell and Great Oxendon with the popular Brixworth Country Park just off the route. This is well worth a small detour as you will find the lovely Pitsford Reservoir which has a fine waterside cycling and walking trail to try. Cycles can also be hired here at the Brixworth visitor centre. As well as the beautiful rural scenery you will also pass Northampton & Lamport Railway with its old steam railway on this pleasant trail.",
