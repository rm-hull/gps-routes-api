  "description": "A circular walk around the Northumberland village of Craster, visiting the Arnold NWT Nature Reserve and the interesting cliff formations at Cullernose Point on the coast. The small fishing village is located in the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It has a pretty harbour and nice coastal footpaths to try. The village is located just to the south of the striking ruins of Dunstanburgh Castle. This circular walk heads in the other direction to visit Cullernose Point where you will find basaltic cliffs which are a significant feature of the local landscape. The walk then passes along a quiet country lane to visit the Arnold Memorial Northumberland Wildlife Trust Reserve where you can look out for various migrant birds and red squirrels. The long distance St Oswald's Way and the Northumberland Coast Path run through the village. You can pick this up and head north to visit the castle and the lovely Beadnell Bay on our Craster to Seahouses Walk. Heading south will take you to Boulmer with its row of cottages and pretty natural haven. Just beyond the village you will come to the picturesque coastal resort of Alnmouth. You can try this beautiful section of the path on our Craster to Alnmouth Walk .",
