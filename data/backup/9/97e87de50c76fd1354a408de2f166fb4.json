  "description": "This pretty riverside hamlet is located just a few miles north of the city of Newport. It sits in a scenic location on the River Usk just east of the village of Tredunnock. The village includes a photogenic 18th century bridge built with red\u00a0sandstone and a fine riverside pub for post walk refreshment. This walk from Newbridge takes you along a section of the Usk Valley Walk to nearby Usk . You can pick up the waymarked trail just to the east of the settlement by following a public footpath past the pretty Llwynau Brook. Follow the waymarked trail north and it will take you to Cefn Hill, Llantrisant and Llanllowell. In this area you will pass along the Olway Brook-Nant Olwy near to its confluence with the Usk. The final section takes you into the town of Usk with more riverside paths and views of the impressive 18th century bridge. In the town you can also visit the site of the 12th century Usk Castle, a Grade I listed building.",
