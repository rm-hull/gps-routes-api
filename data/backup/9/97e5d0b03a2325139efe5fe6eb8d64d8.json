Inverbervie, commonly referred to as Bervie, is situated on a raised beach overlooking Bervie Bay, just south of the point where the River Bervie meets the North Sea. By 1341, it was already a well-established fishing community when King David II and Queen Johanna, returning to Scotland from exile in France, were compelled to land slightly north of the town due to adverse weather conditions."

  "description": "Enjoy a fine coastal walk from Inverbervie to Gourdon in Aberdeenshire. The walk starts in the car park at Inverbervie and heads south past Bervie Bay to Horse Crook Bay before finishing at the pretty fishing village of Gourdon. You'll also pass the 14th century Hallgreen Castle,  which stands on a bluff overlooking the sea towards the southern end of the town. There is also a surfaced path suitable for cyclists, which followsa section of National Cycle Route 1 . It's a pretty flat path with some fine views to Bervie Head to enjoy along the way. The walk can be extended by continuing to Johnshaven on the Gourdon to Johnshaven Walk .",
