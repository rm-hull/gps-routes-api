  "description": "This Staffordshire village is a pleasant place to start a walk with some lovely country trails through the River Dove valley and the surrounding National Forest. The settlement also has some interesting history with a 16th century pub and a noteworthy church dating back to the 12th century. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring settlements of Marston on Dove, Hatton and Tutbury. On the way you'll also visit the historic Tutbury Castle and Tutbury Mill. The walk starts in the village and follows Marston Lane north to the Old Dove River and Dove Bridge. At Dove Bridge you cross the river and continue north to Marston on Dove before following a country lane west to Hatton. Here you turn south, crossing the train line before coming to Tutbury where you can visit the old mill and the castle ruins. After exploring the village you head south east to Hoblands Farm and Shotwood Hill before returning to Rolleston.",

The 17th century mansion is surrounded by beautiful parkland and gardens with another waterside trail along the scenic lake."
