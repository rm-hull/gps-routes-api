  "description": "This walk crosses the island from Sandown to Ryde, passing water meadows and crossing the chalk downland that runs the length of the island. The walk starts at Sandown station and heads north through Brading Down where there are magnificent views of East Wight and the Solent. You may also see the Isle of Wight Steam Railway on the way as it crosses the trail near Smallbrook. Nature lovers should look out for Sand Martins, Chiffchaff and Willow Warblers using the nature hide on the route. The walk finishes just outside Ryde at St John's railway station, though you can easily continue into Ryde.",

      "content": "In August you can try the popular St Helens Fort Walk just to the south of Ryde. The walk takes you out to the 19th century St Helens Fort along the causeway at low tide. Just west of Ryde there's another historic highlight at Quarr Abbey. The Grade I listed abbey monastery dates back to the 12th century and includes a scenic estate with lovely gardens, wildflower meadows and woodland with red squirrels to look out for. Very near the abbey there's also some peaceful woodland trails at Firestone Copse and the splendid Isle of Wight Heritage Steam Railway centre at Havenstreet."
