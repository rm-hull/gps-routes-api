  "description": "This walk crosses the island from Sandown to Ryde, passing water meadows and crossing the chalk downland that runs the length of the island. The walk starts at Sandown station and heads north through Brading Down where there are magnificent views of East Wight and the Solent. You may also see the Isle of Wight Steam Railway on the way as it crosses the trail near Smallbrook. Nature lovers should look out for Sand Martins, Chiffchaff and Willow Warblers using the nature hide on the route. The walk finishes just outside Ryde at St John's railway station, though you can easily continue into Ryde.",
