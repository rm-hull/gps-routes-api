Highlights on the route include Aden Country Park where you will find the Aberdeenshire Farming Museum, forest walks and a ruined country house. The path also passes the peaceful Pitfour Lake, the 13th century ruined abbey at Deer Abbey (see video), the Strichen White Horse and the ancient Strichen Stone Circle. The route is waymarked with the letters F & BW on a red railway logo. The start point at Dyce is located a few miles north west of the city of Aberdeen .",
