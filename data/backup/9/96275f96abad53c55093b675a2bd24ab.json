Newark Priory was founded at the end of the twelfth century by Ruald de Clane and his wife Beatrice of Send and dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Thomas a Beckett. King Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1539. At Newark, the prior was pensioned off, valuables sent to the Tower of London and the land given to the Master of the Kings Horse. It has been said that a cannon was employed from the top of Church Hill to bombard or demolish what were the then extensive buildings! This incident is portrayed in one of a series of paintings made by artist Tessa Kewen in 1963 which are displayed in the porch of St Nicholas Church."

      "content": "At the start of the route there's a couple of good options in Godalming to consider. The historic Star Inn dates back to the 1700s and includes and charming 'Olde Worlde' interior. They serve very good food which you can enjoy in a lovely garden area on warmer days. You can find them at 17 Church Street with postcode GU7 1EL for your sat navs. The Inn on the Lake is another good choice in the town. There's a particularly lovely garden here and a great Sunday roast. You can find them on the Ockford Road at postcode GU7 1RH. They are dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you. In Shalford you could also stop to visit the historic Shalford Mill. The National Trust owned watermill dates from the 18th century and is well worth a visit if you have time after exploring the woods. You can enjoy a fascinating guided tour of the mill and find out all about the its place in the history of Shalford. There's even the opportunity to buy a bag of Shalford Mill flour afterwards. At Pyrford you could take a small detour from the route to visit the noteworthy Church of St Nicholas in Pyrford village. The church is a fine example of a complete Norman church and is one of few medieval churches in the country in the top category of listed building. It is thought likely that Queen Elizabeth I would have worshipped at this church. She reputedly donated a silver chalice to the church in 1570. The church grounds and the surrounding lands are designated a conservation area, having special architectural and historical importance. It is a picturesque place and well worth some investigation if you have time."
