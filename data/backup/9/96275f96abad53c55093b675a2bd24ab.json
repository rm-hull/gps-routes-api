Newark Priory was founded at the end of the twelfth century by Ruald de Clane and his wife Beatrice of Send and dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Thomas a Beckett. King Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1539. At Newark, the prior was pensioned off, valuables sent to the Tower of London and the land given to the Master of the Kings Horse. It has been said that a cannon was employed from the top of Church Hill to bombard or demolish what were the then extensive buildings! This incident is portrayed in one of a series of paintings made by artist Tessa Kewen in 1963 which are displayed in the porch of St Nicholas Church."
