  "description": "This Northumberland based village is located on the River Tyne between Riding Mill and Ovingham. This short walk from the village takes you south along the Stocksfield Burn to the remains of the old Riding Mill. On the way there's the picturesque fords and some nice countryside views to enjoy. To continue your walking in the area you could head north to Bywell where you could explore the 15th century Bywell Castle. The River Tyne Trail also runs through the village. This long distance footpath runs along the river from Tynemouth to Tyne Head. Head east and there's the popular Tyne Riverside Country Park where there's walking and cycling routes along the scenic river.",
