  "description": "Enjoy a short walk above the town of Tavistock on the Tavistock Railway Viaduct. The disused Tavistock North station and associated railway line are now open to the public as a footpath and nature reserve. You can now walk across the viaducts that overlook the town for a distance of just under 1 mile. From the elevated position there are great views over the rooftops of the town. You can pick up the walk off Drake Road in the town centre. Then head south west along the shared cycle and walking path. To continue you walking in the town pick up the Tavistock Canal and enjoy a waterside walk along the towpath. Adjacent to the canal you will find the River Tavy where there are nice surfaced footpaths to follow along a rushing weir. See the Tavistock River Walk page for more details.",

It starts in Tavistock and visits the Tavistock Canal and Grenofen Bridge before linking up with the popular Plym Valley Trail. The shared cycling and walking route is named after the explorer Sir Francis Drake who was born in Tavistock and has a statue at the other end of the route in Plymouth."
