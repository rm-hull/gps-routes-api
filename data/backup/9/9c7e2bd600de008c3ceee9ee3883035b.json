  "description": "Follow this spectacular steel canopy walkway on this tree top walk in Tasmania. Known as the Tahune AirWalk the route runs through the Huon Valley with fine views of the Huon River, the Hartz Mountains and the Picton River. The footbridge is suspended above the trees as high as 50 metres (160 ft) in some places. Along the way there are information boards telling you about the different species of trees in the forest. You can start the walk from the visitor centre which has good facilities including parking, toilets and a cafe. It's located about 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of Tasmania's capital city Hobart. To continue your tree top walking in Australia head to the Otway National Park in Victoria. Here you can try the Otway Treetop Walk, the longest and highest steel canopy walkway in the world. The attraction also includes an exhilirating 30 metre zip-line which takes you back down to the forest floor.",
