  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Glanageenty Forest in Kerry. You'll follow the waymarked Lenihan's Loop and the Bernard Brothers Loop through the lovely Glanageenty valley. On the way there are pretty streams, peaceful woodland trails, a waterfall and lots of birdlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for hen harriers, kestrels and pheasants as you make your way along the paths. The woods also have a fascinating history having been used for refuge during the Desmond Rebellion and the Irish Civil War.",
