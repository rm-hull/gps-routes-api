  "description": "This section of the Calder and Hebble Navigation Canal runs along National Cycle Route 66 from Sowerby Bridge to Brighouse. It's a nice easy, traffic free ride along the towpath with some lovely views of the Calder Valley countryside and the River Calder. Walkers can also enjoy this section of the canal. The route starts in Sowerby Bridge and heads to Copley. Just after Copley you have the option of heading north along the Halifax arm into Halifax. This route continues to Elland, where you'll pass Elland Park Wood where there are some nice woodland trails. The final section takes you into Brighouse passing Brookfoot Ski Lake on the way. The Rochdale Canal also passes through Sowerby Bridge so you can pick this up to continue your exercise. It heads to the popular town of Hebden Bridge in the Upper Calder Valley. It also passes through the neigbouring village of Mytholmroyd with some cycling sections along National Cycle Route 66.",
