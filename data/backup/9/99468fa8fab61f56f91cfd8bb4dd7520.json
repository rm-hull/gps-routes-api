  "description": "Black Combe sits in the south west corner of the Lake District. It's proximity to the coast means you get fabulous sea views from the 1970 foot (600m) summit. On a clear day you can see Wales, Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. This walk starts from a parking area off the A5093 near Silecroft. You can also access the route from the nearby Silecroft train station. The route follows good footpaths through Whicham, before climbing to Townend Knotts and on to the Black Combe summit. The views are magnificent with the Pennine Hills, the Forest of Bowland , Blackpool Tower, Snowdon and Scafell Pike all visible on a clear day. You can descend by the same path or continue round to Whitbeck to turn it into a circular walk. This walk shows a direct route up to the summit but you could also go via White Combe as shown in the video below.",
