  "description": "This long walk explores the beautiful Seven Heads Peninsula in West Cork. Along the way you'll pass pretty coastal villages, sandy beaches and lovely bays. The route first visits the eastern side of the headland, visiting the lovely seaside village of Courtmacsherry. You then pass along Courtmacsherry Bay to Broadstrand Bay and beach, before visiting Quarry Point and Barry's Point. You continue south to Carrigrour and Leganagh Point, with lovely views across Seven Heads Bay. You continue west, with an inland section, before passing along Follareal Bay to visit Dunworthy Point. You then turn north to enjoy a long section along the picturesque Dunworthy Bay. The final coastal section then takes you to Coosderrig, Turkeyland, Barry's Cove and Ballinglanna Cove where you leave the coast for a countryside section through Ballincourcey.To continue your coastal walking in Cork, head east to try the Ballycotton Cliff Walk . The popular coastal walk runs from Ballycotton village to Ballyandreen along a wonderful cliff top path. Also to the east you will find the Old Head of Kinsale where there's a shorter loop to follow around the headland."
