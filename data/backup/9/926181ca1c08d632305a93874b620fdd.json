The route first visits the eastern side of the headland, visiting the lovely seaside village of Courtmacsherry. You then pass along Courtmacsherry Bay to Broadstrand Bay and beach, before visiting Quarry Point and Barry's Point. You continue south to Carrigrour and Leganagh Point, with lovely views across Seven Heads Bay. You continue west, with an inland section, before passing along Follareal Bay to visit Dunworthy Point. You then turn north to enjoy a long section along the picturesque Dunworthy Bay. The final coastal section then takes you to Coosderrig, Turkeyland, Barry's Cove and Ballinglanna Cove where you leave the coast for a countryside section through Ballincourcey.To continue your coastal walking in Cork, head east to try the Ballycotton Cliff Walk. The popular coastal walk runs from Ballycotton village to Ballyandreen along a wonderful cliff top path. Also to the east you will find the Old Head of Kinsale where there's a shorter loop to follow around the headland.",

The vibrant seaside town has a fine walk along Clonakilty Harbour to Inchydoney Island where there's a lovely blue flag beach. A few miles to the east there's another local highlight at Charles Fort. The National Monument of Ireland dates back to the 17th century and includes good footpaths to follow around the Bastions. There's also some excellent views over Kinsale harbour and exhibitions where you can learn all about the history of the area. Also to the east there's more cliff top walking on the Crosshaven Cliff Walk. This fine circular walk provides wonderful views over Cork Harbour and visits the 16th century Camden Fort Meagher. Near Cork there's the 13th century Blarney Castle to explore. The ancient castle is surrounded by some beautiful grounds and gardens with miles of footpaths to enjoy. Head west towards Skibbereen and you could visit Lough Hyne. Here you will find a significant Marine Nature Reserve with cliffs, salt marsh, beach and a popular circular walking trail. Near here there's also Galley Head where you can explore the sand dunes at Long Strand beach before heading towards the 19th century lighthouse at the end of the headland.
