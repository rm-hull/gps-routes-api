  "description": "This walk in Northumberland visits the Hethpool Linn waterfall before a climb to the hillfort at West Hill. The falls are located in the College Valley, a beautiful and peaceful area with lots of interesting flora and fauna. The walk starts at the car park at Hethpool and heads along the College Burn to the waterfall. The route then heads north east to West Hill which includes an old hill fort on its 215 metre high summit. There's lovely views of the countryside and hills of the College Valley from here. After rounding the hill you can pick up a section of the St Cuthbert's Way and follow it west to Hethpool Mill before returning to the car park. You could extend the walk by continuing east to climb to Yeavering Bell. The noteworthy site includes the largest Iron Age hillfort in the region.",
