  "description": "This long distance walking trail takes follows the course of the River Suir from The Vee Gap to Cashel. Starting from the renowned viewing point, the Gap above the Vee, this trail traces a segment of an ancient roadway connecting Cashel with the coastal town of Ardmore. This historic route, once traversed by notable figures such as St Patrick and King Henry II, passes through the charming villages of Ardfinnan and Golden, ultimately leading to Cashel. The landscape encompasses serene country roads, forestry tracks, and riverside paths, occasionally featuring overgrown and damp stretches. The trail beckons walkers to explore its numerous attractions, including churches, abbeys, ancient graveyards, castles, and a delightful cottage orn\u00e9. Along the river stretches, a variety of waterfowl, including the ubiquitous heron, grace the scenery, and fortunate observers may catch a glimpse of otters in their natural habitat. The journey is laden with historical and natural wonders, offering tempting pauses for those who wish to soak in the rich tapestry of the region. Route highlights the historic Cahir Castle where you will find a 12th century fortress wonderfully positioned on an island in the river Suir. The castle grounds and the town are a lovely place for a stroll on the walk. Near here there's also the Rock Of Cashel. The ancient site houses Ireland's most remarkable collection of medieval structures. In Cashel you can also visit the photogenic ruins of Hore Abbey which lies just to the west of the Rock.",
