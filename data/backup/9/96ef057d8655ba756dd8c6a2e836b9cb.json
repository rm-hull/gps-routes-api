  "description": "This Gloucestershire village includes the settlements of Eastleach Turville and Eastleach Martin which sit either side of the River Leach. It's an historic place with two Norman churches and an ancient stone slab clapper footbridge over the river. All in all there are over 60 listed buildings across the two villages. The picture postcard settlement is also known for its display of daffodils in the spring and a very fine 18th century pub. This walk explores the two settlements before heading south through the countryside to visit neighbouring Southrop. It's another attractive place with an 11th century church and a series of old stone cottages to admire. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit Lechlade where you can enjoy a riverside walk along the Thames Path National Trail.",
