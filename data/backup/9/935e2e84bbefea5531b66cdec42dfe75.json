  "description": "Enjoy wonderful views of the Langdale Valley on this walk to Lingmoor Fell in the Lake District. This route starts from The Old Dungeon Ghyll hotel and takes you to the 469 m (1,539 ft) summit via Side Pike. The fell divides the valleys of Great Langdale and Little Langdale commanding splendid views of the two. The walk includes a woodland section at the start and the option to take a small detour to the beautiful Lingmoor Tarn. If you are looking for a shorter route to the summit then you could park at the car park at Blea Tarn and head north along the country lane to Bleatarn house where a path will take you to the summit of Lingmoor Fell. To continue your walking in the area you could try our Little Langdale circular walk. The route visits Little Langdale Tarn and the intriguing cave system at Cathedral Cavern . The climb through Hell Gill Gorge also starts from the hotel and includes some lovely waterfalls and more great views.",
