  "description": "This splendid walk takes you from the Shropshire/Cheshire border into Wales. The path starts at Grindley Brook near Whitchurch and heads west to Penley in Wales, passing around the pretty Hanmer Mere on the way. You continue to Overton and then Erbistock where you join the River Dee and then the River Ceiriog to Chirk before the final waterside section leads to the finish point at Bronygarth. This is a beautiful walk through some fabulous English and Welsh countryside. It also has several waterside streches along the two rivers with a stroll along the Llangollen Canal near Chirk to enjoy also.",
