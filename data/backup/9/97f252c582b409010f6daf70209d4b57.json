The estimated cost in 1901 was \u00a327,583. By the time the dam was completed it had risen to \u00a3119,697.13s.6d. Much of the extra was spent on laying a satisfactory foundation: instead of solid granite under the turf, faults and broken rocks were found which had to be cemented over."

  "description": "This short circular walk takes you around the pretty Venford Reservoir on Dartmoor. It's a nice easy stroll with woodland sections and waterside trails to enjoy. Parking is available and there are picnic tables dotted around the lake. If you'd like to extend your walk you could climb Bench Tor to the north of the reservoir. From here you can enjoy splendid views of River Dart Valley. The reservoir is located just to the west of the Dartmoor Way long distance footpath. You could pick up the waymarked trail and visit the nearby Hembury Woods and River Dart Country Park to extend your exercise.",

Here you could pay a visit to the Tradesman's Arms where you can enjoy home cooked food in the lovely garden area, overlooking the Little Combe Valley. You can find them at postcode TQ11 0JB for your sat navs. Another worthy option is to head north to Dartmeet. The little village is the location where the tributaries of the East Dart and West Dart meet. It's a fine place for a stroll and includes the splendid Badger's Holt tea rooms where you could enjoy a delicious cream tea with a view of the river. There's also peacocks, hens and goats adding to the appeal."

The walk also visits the viewpoint at Bench Tor and the secluded Venford Waterfall just to the north of the lake. The site is located just a few miles north east from Buckflastleigh. Here you can try the Buckfastleigh and Buckfast Abbey Walk. The historic abbey is one of the area's highlights and includes a Lavender garden, Physic garden and Sensory garden. Just a few miles to the south there's more pleasant waterside paths at the impressive Avon Dam Reservoir. Here you'll find a fine walk running along the River Avon up to the lake where there's a photogenic dam and some excellent views. To the north east there's the worthy climb to Buckland Beacon. The beacon is well known for its Ten Commandments Stones and its excellent views over the Dart Valley. The interesting rock formations at Combestone Tor are located just to the north west. There is a car park directly next to the tor for easy access or you could follow a country lane north west from the reservoir."
