The construction of the dam, which was to supply water to the expanding population of Paignton, was carried out by Hawkins & Best of Teignmouth with a Mr Frederick Vanstone, Water Engineer for Paignton, in charge of the works. The estimated cost in 1901 was \u00a327,583. By the time the dam was completed it had risen to \u00a3119,697.13s.6d. Much of the extra was spent on laying a satisfactory foundation: instead of solid granite under the turf, faults and broken rocks were found which had to be cemented over."

  "description": "This short circular walk takes you around the pretty Venford Reservoir on Dartmoor. It's a nice easy stroll with woodland sections and waterside trails to enjoy. Parking is available and there are picnic tables dotted around the lake. If you'd like to extend your walk you could climb Bench Tor to the north of the reservoir. From here you can enjoy splendid views of River Dart Valley. The reservoir is located just to the west of the Dartmoor Way long distance footpath. You could pick up the waymarked trail and visit the nearby Hembury Woods and River Dart Country Park to extend your exercise.",
