  "description": "This walk climbs to a hill fort and lovely viewpoint above the town of Barmouth. The site is historically significant as the first area of land donated to the National Trust in 1895 by Mrs Fanny Talbot. It's a short climb to the hill top from train station and the town centre. From here you can enjoy splendid views over the Mawddach Estuary to the surrounding hills. You can start the walk from Dinas Oleu Lane, just a short stroll north east of the train station. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north east up to the viewpoint. The hill is on the Panorama Walk so its easy to continue your walk if you have time. The popular trail climbs higher into the hills surrounding the town, with more wonderful views to enjoy.",
