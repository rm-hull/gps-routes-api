The former estate is now owned and managed by the Peak District National Park. The hall is now divided into two apartments, which are available as holiday lets. You can follow public footpaths north from the village to reach the hall."

  "description": "The village of Hathersage is a popular base for walkers wishing to explore some of the highlights of the Peak District National Park. It has several long distance trails running past it and a number of challenging climbs to try. Set in the beautiful Hope and Derwent Valleys the village is accessible by rail services to Hathersage train station. Probably the most popular walk from the village is the climb to the beautiful gritstone escarpment of Stanage Edge. A similarly exhilirating climb across Bamford Edge is also possible from the village. There's more interesting gritstone rock formations and fabulous views from here. The Derwent Valley Heritage Way also runs through the village along the River Derwent. If you follow the riverside path in a north westerly direction it will soon take you to the beautiful Ladybower Reservoir. Heading south along the river will take you to the splendid Longshaw Estate and Padley Gorge with its beautiful wooded valley. The 'Plague Village' of Eyam is just a few miles to the south of Hathersage. It is well worth a visit with its fascinating history, 17th century Eyam Hall and stone circle on Eyam Moor. This circular walk takes you up on to Hathersage Moor, visiting Higger Tor and Carl Wark Hill Fort. There's lovely moorland scenery, fine views back down to the village and some interesting rock formations to look out for. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths to High Lees before climbing onto Hathersage Moor. Here you visit the Iron Age Hill Fort of Carl Wark which stands at a height of 370 metres (1,214 ft). The path then climbs to the nearby Higger Tor at a height of 434 m (1,424 ft). The striking gritstone tor overlooks the Burbage Valley. The route then descends to Burbage Bridge with views of the pretty Burbage Brook. Around here you can pick up the Padley Gorge Trail which takes you along the delightful brook with its waterfalls, rocky boulders and wooden bridges. This walk heads into the National Trust owned Longshaw Estate. The estate is fabulous walking country with ancient woods, parkland, heather moorland, ponds and the pretty Barbrage Brook. This section of the trail also links with the Sheffield Country Walk which takes you on a circular tour of the countryside around the city of Sheffield. The final section of the walk takes you through Granby Wood and Yarncliff Wood before crossing the western side of the moor and returning to the village. For alternative route to the tor see our Higger Tor Walk. It's a much shorter route which starts from the Burbage Bridge car park.",
