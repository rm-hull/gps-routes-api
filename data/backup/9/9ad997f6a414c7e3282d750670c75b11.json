  "description": "Explore this beautiful narrow vale on this popular circular walk near Llangollen. The World's End Gorge is a great place for a walk with pretty streams, little waterfalls and attractive woodland. It's an atmospheric place with the area enclosed by the cliffs of Craig y Forwyn, Craig y Cythraul, and Craig yr Adar. The walk takes you through the delightful wooded gorge to the heather moors on top of the Eglwyseg Mountain. As such it's a nice varied route with wonderful views of the River Eglwyseg and the surrounding Welsh Hills with lots of interesting flora and fauna. You can start off from the public car parking area just off a country lane to the north of the site. This route is designed for walkers but the area is also popular with mountain bikers. See the video below of cyclists on the Horseshoe Pass for details! The Offa's Dyke Path runs past the area so you could pick this up and head north to the nearby Llandegla Forest . If you would like a more challenging walk then try the climb to Castell Dinas Bran . The atmospheric ruins of the medieval castle are a must see if you are visiting the area. Easier walking can be found along the towpath of the lovely Llangollen Canal . You could also start the walk from Llangollen and follow the trail through the beautiful Vale of Llangollen to World's End. Our Panorama Walk starts from the nearby famous Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and follows the scenic country road up to the site. The area is also only a few miles west of Wrexham.",
