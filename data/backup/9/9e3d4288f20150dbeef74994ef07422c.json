  "description": "Enjoy a coastal walk in this lovely Somerset town. The town includes a pretty harbour, quay and attractive beaches. This route takes you along the West Somerset Coast Path to one of the highlights of the area at Dunster Castle. The walk starts next to Minehead Train Station which is on the West Somerset Railway. You can catch the historic steam locomotives and enjoy views of the Quantocks on the scenic railway. From here you head south past the golf course to Dunster Beach. The beach is a splendid place for a walk with fine sea views and a nature reserve where you can look out for a variety of birdlife. After about a mile or so you can turn south and head past Dunster Station to Dunster Castle. The Norman Castle is surrounded by a lovely deer park where there are miles of footpaths to try. There's also some beautiful gardens and views toward the Bristol channel, the Quantock hills and Exmoor. After exploring the castle grounds the walk returns to the town centre on the same paths. The town is also the start/end point for the epic South West Coast Path. You could extend your walking in the area by following the path north to visit Greenaleigh Point where there are some nice woodland trails.",
