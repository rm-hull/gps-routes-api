At the Nenthead mining heritage centre you can learn all about the lead and zinc mining history of the North Pennines. There's also mine entrances, dumps, old buildings, reservoirs and some rare plants growing on the metal-rich mine dumps. It's an interesting and scenic area to explore if you have time."

  "description": "Follow in the footsteps of the legendary tea seller Isaac Holden on this challenging circular walk through the North Pennines. The walk starts at the pretty village of Allendale Town , and heads south along the River East Allen and through West Allen Dale to Nenthead ,  where you will find the interesting Nenthead Mining Centre. Another lovely waterside section along the River Nent then takes you to Alston, before turning north towards Kirkhaugh. One option is to take the fantastic South Tynedale Railway from Alston to Kirkhaugh (video below). The route then heads along the River South Tyne and then up to Ouston Fell before joining the River West Allen for another riverside section. The final leg follows the River East Allen back into Allendale town. The walk is waymarked with a green disc featuring a portrait of Isaac Holden. Around Alston the trail links with the South Tyne Trail . The riverside cycling and walking trail takes you from Tyne Head to Haltwhistle with more great views of the North Pennines. You can also pick up the Pennine Way in the same area.",
