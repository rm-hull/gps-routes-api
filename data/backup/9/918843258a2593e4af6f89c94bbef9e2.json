  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this large park in Watford. There's 190 acres to explore with good footpaths and a section along the Grand Union Canal Walk at the western end of the park. There's also a waymarked nature trail where you can look out for a variety of wildlife including Herons, Kingfishers, Woodpeckers, Butterflies, Bats, Dragonflies, Newts and Snakes. The western end of the park, near the canal, is also a designated nature reserve. Look out for flycatchers, redwings and fieldfares. Cycling is also permitted in the park on designated paths. If you'd like to extend your walk you could head a mile west to the ancient woodland of Whippendell Woods. Also nearby is Chipperfield Common where you'll find waymarked, woodland walking trails to try.",
