  "description": "This walk visit Strines Reservoir in Bradfield Dale near the city of Sheffield. There's some roadside parking just to the west of the reservoir. You can pick up footpaths heading between Strines and the adjacent Dale Dike Reservoir before climbing towards Sugworth Hall. On the walk look out for the historic Brogging House, a dwelling which pre-dates the reservoir by some time, being recorded as being leased by George Woodhead in 1715. The house stands at the north end of the dam wall and at one time served as the reservoir-keeper's house when one was required.",
