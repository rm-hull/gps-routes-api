  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside surrounding the Lancashire town of Adlington. The route runs for just under 6 miles and includes a nice waterside stretch along the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. You can start from anywhere on the route but the car park near the canal at Jubilee Fields is a good place. Adlington train station is also a short stroll from the canal so this is a good option if you are coming by public transport. Starting on the canal just west of the train station head north to Rigshaw Bridge and Allanson Hall. You continue to Idle Bridge in Heath Charnock, crossing the canal and the A673. You then head east through the countryside to Slack's Farm before crossing the motorway. You then follow New Road south before turning west toward Anderton. The final section takes you south west past Huyton House before rejoining the canal for a final waterside stretch. You'll pass the Aqueduct carrying the Leeeds-Liverpool canal over the River Douglas around here.",
