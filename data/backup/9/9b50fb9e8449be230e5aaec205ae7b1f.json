  "description": "This park is located near Ramsgate and has splendid views over Pegwell Bay and Sandwich Bay. In the bay is a large nature reserve, known for its migrating waders and wildfowl. A local cycle route runs right through the park so you can take your bike. To extend your walking in the Ramsgate area you can pick up the Thanet Coastal Path and enjoy a splendid coastal walk from Ramsgate to Margate . The Sandwich Walk visits the River Stour and the ancient Roman amphitheatre at Richborough Castle.",
