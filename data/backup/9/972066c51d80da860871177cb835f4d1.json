  "description": "This walk takes you from the Somerset city of Wells to Glastonbury Tor. The route uses a mixture of waymarked footpaths and quiet country lanes to take you through the countryside between the two settlements. It runs for a distance of about 8 miles along flat paths before a small climb at the end. The walk starts at the historic Wells Cathedral where you can pick up the Monarch's Way and follow it south towards Launcherley. You then head west along the Long Drove before turning south to head through the countryside at the western outskirts of Glastonbury. The route then heads east through the town passing the fascinating Glastonbury Abbey before climbing to the famous hill for great views over the area.",
