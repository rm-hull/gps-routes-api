  "description": "This walk takes you to Eas a' Chrannaig or Glenashdale Falls on the Isle of Arran. You can start the walk in the coastal village of Whiting Bay. Head west from here and you can pick up a footpath along the Glenashdale Burn to the falls. It's just over a mile walk through peaceful woodland to the photogenic falls from Ashdale Bridge. Here you can admire the scene from above from the viewing platforms before returning on the same path. The Arran Coastal Way passes the site so you could pick this up to extend your walk if you have time. See the Lamlash to Whiting Bay Walk page for more details.",
