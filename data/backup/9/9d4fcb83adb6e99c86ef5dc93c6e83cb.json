  "description": "This short circular walk explores this coastal headland at the mouth of the\u00a0River Shannon, in\u00a0County Clare. In 2013, Loop Head was named the 'Best Place to Holiday in Ireland' and was shortlisted in the Best Destination category at the World Responsible Tourism awards.\u00a0The scenery is very beautiful but it is also a quiet place with less tourists than some of the other nearby coastal highlights of this part of Ireland. This short walk takes you around the lighthouse at the end of the peninsula. You can park next to the lighthouse and then pick up footpaths taking you to Cuchullin's Leap where you can see the giant sea stack. There's fabulous sea views and lot of coastal birds to look out for on the headland. The area is free to explore but for a fee you can also climb to a great viewing platform in the lighthouse. To continue your coastal walking in County Clare head to the wonderful Cliffs of Moher . The walk is one of the most popular in Ireland with spectacular cliff top views and puffins and razorbills to look out for on the cliffs. You can virtually explore the area using the google street view link below!",
