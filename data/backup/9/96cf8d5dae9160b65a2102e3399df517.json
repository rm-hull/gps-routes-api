Old maps consistently call the place Luxton's Steps although the 1:25 000 map of 2005 calls it Luxton's Step. At the top of the steps down to the beach is a sign relating the modern history of the place, calling it Luxton Steps. A fuzzy view from across the river is here."

  "description": "This pretty village is located on the River Teign Estuary between the more well known settelments of Teignmouth and Newton Abbot. The historic settlement includes a small museum, the ruins of a 14th century chapel and a fine 16th century pub to relax in after your exercise. This walk from the village takes you down to the estuary. You can follow a public footpath south down to Luxton's Steps, crossing the railway line as you go. You can then walk along the beach at Red Rock and enjoy a view over the river towards Shaldon and the Coombe Cellars pub on the opposite side. To continue your walking from the village head north to visit Little Haldon Heath. There's some nice heathland trails and lots of interesting flora and fauna to see here. You can find the heath a couple of miles north of the village. There is a National Trust car park which can be found at postcode TQ13 0BW for your sat navs.",
