  "description": "This pleasant circular walk in Bromley explores the countryside around the village of Leaves Green. It runs for just over 6 miles with some small climbs. On the way there's attractive common land, woodland, views of Biggin Hill airport and a visit to Down House the former home of Charles Darwin. The walk starts from the picturesque village of Leaves Green where there's a lovely village green and pretty cottages dating from the 19th century. From here you first pick up footpaths heading to Furze Bottom in the countryside to the west of the village. You then follow footpaths north east towards Holwood Farm before turning south towards Farthing Street and the village of Downe. Here you'll find Down House where Darwin resided. The English Heritage owned house is now an interactive museum where you can learn all about his theories of evolution by natural selection. The path then heads west past Green Hill and the West Kent Golf Course before skirting the edge of Biggin Hill Airport and returning to Leaves Green.",
