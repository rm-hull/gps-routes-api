  "description": "This walk follows a section of the South West Coast Path from Sidmouth to Branscombe. The route is just under 5 miles along an undulating path with excellent views for most of the way. The walk starts in Sidmouth and heads east along the waymarked path up to Salcombe Hill Cliff. Turn around here and there are fine views back to the town. The path continues east to the Higher and Lower Dunscombe Cliffs, passing Chapman's Rocks on the way. The cliffs are one of the high points of the walk, commanding excellent views in both directions. The path continues to Weston Cliff and Coxe's Cliff before descending into Branscombe where the route finishes.",
