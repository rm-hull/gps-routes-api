  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of the West Highland Way from Balmaha to Rowardennan via Milarrochy Bay. The route runs for about 7 miles, following a waymarked footpath along the eastern side of Loch Lomond. There are some moderate climbs along the way with splendid views over the loch from the high points. The walk starts from the car park and visitor centre at Balmaha Forest. From here you can pick up the trail and head north west past the ferry which runs over to the nearby Inchcailloch Island. You'll pass the viewpoint at Craigie Fort before continuing north to Arrochymore Point, Milarrochy Bay and the woodland trails at Lag An Amair Wood. The route then skirts the western edge of the expansive Rowardennan Forest National Memorial Park. The final section runs through Ross Wood before finishing at at the pier and visitor centre in Rowardennan. Here you'll find shelter, toilets, changing facilities, a bin-store and an exhibition area providing local information. The route links with the next stage of the trail on the Rowardennan to Inversnaid Walk. This will take you to Inversnaid where you can visit the lovely Inversnaid falls. The popular climb to Ben Lomond starts from Rowardennan as well.",
