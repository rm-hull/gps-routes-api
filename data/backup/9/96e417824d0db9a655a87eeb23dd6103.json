  "description": "Visit this pretty natural lake in the village of Rostherne, Cheshire. The area is a designated nature reserve where you can look out for a variety of wildfowl on the water. The reserve has no public access but there is a public footpath and viewpoint to the west of the mere. This is on Rostherne Lane and is shown on the google street view link below. It's an attractive area with the peaceful mere surrounded by woodland and countryside. Bring your binoculars and look out for cormorants, great crested grebe, tufted duck, pochard,\u00a0goldeneye,\u00a0teal\u00a0and\u00a0wigeon. The drone video below shows St Mary's Church in the village of Rostherne and a bird's eye view of the mere and surrounding countryside. For cyclists Regional Cycle Route 70 runs through the village of Rostherne just to the south of the mere. You can then follow country lanes around the water. You can extend your walking in the area by heading north to the splendid Dunham Massey and exploring the magnificent deer park. In the nearby village of Lymm you can try the popular walk around the lovely Lymm Dam or head to Tatton Park where there's miles of excellent walking and cycling trails.",
