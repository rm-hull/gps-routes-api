  "description": "Enjoy a short circular walk around this National Trust owned estate near Cheltenham. The walk takes you through attractive woodland, farmland, and the delightful little village of Sherborne. There is a car park at Ewe Pen about a mile west of the village. You start the walk from here and then head through woodland and the Pleasure Grounds to the village. Look out for wildlife sculptures and the 19th century ice house on this section. At the village you can enjoy refreshments at the tea shop. The route continues passing the St. Mary Magdalene church and the pretty Sherborne Brook, before another woodland section takes you back to the car park. The estate is great for wildlife spotting. Look out for skylark, yellowhammer, linnet and hare. The Cotswold Way and the Monarch's Way long distance walking trails run through the nearby villages of Northleach and Farmington. You could pick up one of these trails to extend your walking in the area. Head east from the estate and you could visit the pretty Windrush Mill and the village of Great Barrington. Here you can explore Barrington Park where there's riverside paths along the River Windrush and lots of deer to look out for. You could also head a couple of miles south west to Lodge Park and enjoy more good National Trust footpaths.",
