  "description": "The Derwent Walk is a former railway path running from Swalwell, near Gateshead , to Consett alongside the River Derwent and is suitable for walkers and cyclists. The Derwent Walk Country Park is situated on the path and contains a mixture of woodland, meadows and wetlands. There is also the pretty Clockburn Lake located in Derwenthaugh Park. There are a number of excellent waymarked trails, taking you along the river and through Thornley Woods .  You can get further information from the Thornley Wood Visitor Centre located at Thornley Lane, Rowlands Gill NE39 1AU. A wide variety of wildlife visits the park such as great spotted woodpecker, nuthatch, sparrowhawk, fox, badger and roe deer. Also look out for kingfisher, dipper and otter around the river. The park is located a few miles west of Gateshead, near Blaydon and Ebchester .",
