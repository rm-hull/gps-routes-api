  "description": "Enjoy woodland trails, a spectacular landscaped garden and the National Centre for Birds of Prey in this large park and nature reserve in Helmsley, Yorkshire. You can enjoy a gentle stroll around the 35 acre 18th century green gardens. Here you will find a great lawn, terraces, temples, a yew tree walk and the scented 'secret garden'. Continue into the wider estate and you can visit the deer parks, explore large areas of woodland and enjoy a waterside stroll along the River Rye. At the National Centre for Birds of Prey you can see owls, falcons, hawks, buzzards and eagles. If you'd like to extend your walk you could follow the Cleveland Way to Rievaulx Abbey. A few miles south east of the park you will find the 17th century manor house of Nunnington Hall. Here you can try the circular Nunnington and the River Rye Walk which explores the countryside surrounding the hall.",
