That was, and still is, my ideal scenery.\""

  "description": "This village in County Durham is an interesting place for a walk. There's some great North Pennines scenery, nice riverside trails, hill climbs and evidence of the area's lead mining history to see. This route from the village uses sections of the Weardale Way to create a circular walk through the area to the south of the settlement. The walk starts at Bolt's Burn and heads south along the waymarked footpath and the Rookhope Burn. You'll pass Pry Barr and Smailsburn before climbing to the viewpoint at Bishop Seat. You then descend south east to North Hanging Wells and the burn where you'll pass the Turn Wheel Waterfall. At Eastgate you turn north to head to Ashy Bank and Brandon Walls where there's some woodland trails along the burn. The route then passes Stotfield Burn before returning to the village and finishing by the ford.",
