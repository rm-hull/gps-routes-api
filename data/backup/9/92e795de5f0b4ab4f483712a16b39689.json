  "description": "This Kent based town is located in the Tunbridge Wells area of the county, just north of Brenchley and Matfield. This waterside walk from the town takes you along the Tudeley Brook and the River Medway to the neighbouring town of Tonbridge, where you can explore the historic castle. The walk starts at the train station and heads north and then west to meet up with the pretty brook. Follow this north and it will take you to the River Medway where you can pick up the Medway Valley Walk. The waymarked riverside footpath will take you west into Tonbridge where you will finish at the castle. Scroll down for a list of walks near and around Paddock Wood.",
