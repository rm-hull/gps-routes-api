  "description": "This delightful Dorset settlement near Wimborne includes typical village features such as a picturesque green, a cricket pitch, a fine old church and quaint thatched cottages. This circular walk from the village visits Kingston Lacy, Sturminster Marshall and the River Stour. On the way there's country views, riverside paths and bluebell woods to explore. The walk starts from the car park at Pamphill Green and heads north west to skirt the edge of Kingston Lacy House, passing the pretty bluebell woods at Abbot Street Copse on the way. You follow a country lane west before picking up the Stour Valley Way and following the waymarked footpath west to visit the pretty neighbouring village of Sturminster Marshall where there's some lovely views of the river Stour. Near here you can also visit the National Trust's White Mill. The 18th century mill is open for informative tours on certain days. From Sturminster Marshall you retrace your steps before following Cowgrove Road back to Little Pamphill and the car park. You can extend the walk by entering the grounds of Kingston Lacy House where there are miles of trails around the expansive parkland and gardens.",
