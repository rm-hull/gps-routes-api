  "description": "Enjoy a waterside circular walk around this lovely reservoir in the Forest of Bowland. The walk begins at the car park at the northern end of the reservoir and heads through the edge of Gisburn Forest and crosses the causeway. You then pick up a walking track which runs close to the waters edge, passing Rushton Hill and Ten Acre Hill on the way. On the western side you head to Eak Hill and Copped Hill Clough before a final woodland section through Gisburn Forest returns you to the car park. This is a lovely walk through woodland and farmland on well maintained, signed footpaths. There are splendid views of the surrounding countryside and hills plus ample opportunity for wildfowl spotting on the water. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head deeper into the adjacent Gisburn Forest. You could also pick up the long distance Forest of Bowland Walk or head to the beautiful Trough of Bowland. You can visit the reservoir from the village of Slaidburn on our Slaidburn Walk .",
