The first bridges to the islands were built in 1828; prior to their construction the only access to the islands was by boat. The original bridges were washed away in the flood of 1849 and were replaced in 1853-1854 by two suspension bridges designed by William Dredge. The islands are a walking spot on the Great Glen Way and are home to a number of imported species of trees and wildlife such as bats, otters and occasionally deer. The area includes play facilities for children, and the Ness Islands miniature railway."

  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll along the River Ness on this popular waterside walk in Inverness. The route starts at the impressive riverside castle and follows the riverside path along the Great Glen Way to the delightful Whin Park. It's a lovely area with peaceful woodland next to the river and the delightful Ness Islands in Whin Park at the end of the walk. The islands are a natural beauty spot with attractive woodland with otters and deer to look out for. In the park you can also enjoy a ride on the Ness Islands Railway. The super miniature railways runs in the summer months and includes a crossing of a 140-foot iron bridge dating from 1837. It's easy to extend your walk by picking up the Caledonian Canal and following the to path to Loch Dochfour.",
