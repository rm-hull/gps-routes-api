  "description": "This circular walk explores the Driffield Canal before heading to the neighbouring village of Nafferton along the Nafferton Brook. The route runs for just under 7 miles on a series of flat footpaths so is suitable for most abilities. Driffield is a noteworthy town having been named The Capital of the Wolds because of its central position in the Yorkshire Wolds. It's a pleasant place to visit and was listed in the 2019 Sunday Times report on the Best Places to Live in northern England. The associated canal has recently been restored by the Driffield Navigation Trust and now has new navigable sections and footpaths for walkers. The route starts from the centre of Driffield, close to the train station at the head of the canal. It's a very pretty area with two 19th century cranes and the old mills. From here you can pick up a footpath and follow it south east towards Wansford. On this section there's also views of the River Hull which runs alongside the canal. At Wansford you turn north east to follow a public footpath along the Nafferton Beck which will lead you into Nafferton. It's a picturesque village with the attractive Nafferton Mere as the centrepiece. From Nafferton you then head west, following Markman Lane and Meadow Lane back into Driffield.",
