  "description": "Enjoy some simply stunning coastal scenery in this country park on the East coast of Scotland. There are boardwalks taking you over the sand and through the extensive dune system. The beach has won seaside awards in 2006 and 2007. Facilities include a good sized car park and picnic benches. Balmedie is about 6 miles north of Aberdeen so you could continue your walk along the beach to the city if you have time. To continue your walking in the area head west to the nearby Kirkhill Forest. There's miles of good waymarked trails with hill climbs and great viewpoints here.",
