  "description": "This walk near Grantham takes you from the village of Denton to Denton Reservoir. It's a lovely spot with nice views across the water and lots of wildlife to look out for. Birdwatchers come to the site to see coot, moorhen, mallard, teal, pochard, heron, great crested grebe and kingfishers. The reservoir is located a short distance from the centre of the village. Starting on Church Street head east to Casthorpe Road and then turn north. Shortly after you will see a footpath on your right which will take you up to the reservoir. Here you will find a nice grassy footpath around the perimeter. The whole route is about 2 miles but if you feel like stretching your legs further you can head to the nearby Grantham Canal. Following the towpath east will take you into Grantham while heading west leads you towards Woolsthorpe. Around here you can pick up the long distance Viking Way and visit the splendid Belvoir Castle with its lakes, woodland and parkland. Also nearby is the pretty village of Knipton where there are some nice country lanes along Knipton Reservoir .",
