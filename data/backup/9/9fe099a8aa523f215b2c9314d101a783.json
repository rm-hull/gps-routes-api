  "description": "Enjoy an easy cycle or walk along the Keswick Railway Path in the Lake District National Park. The tree lined path runs along the trackbed of the old Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith railway, following the River Greta from Keswick to Threlkeld. It's great for families as it's a nice easy cycle ride with a flat and well defined path. Walkers can enjoy the path too as it makes for a super riverside stroll. The latter part of the video below gives a good commentary on the railway path and shows the lovely scenery you can expect to see on the route. This includes the beautiful tree-clad Greta Gorge and views of the magnificent Blencathra mountain. Near to the route is the fascinating Castlerigg Stone Circle. Often thought of as the Stonehenge of the Lake District the ancient stone circle is located just to the south of the path and is well worth a visit. To extend your walk you climb to the nearby Latrigg Fell and enjoy great views over the area.",

The pub does good food and also has a nice garden area to sit out in if the weather is fine. You can find the pub on 10 Lake Road with a postcode of CA12 5BT for your sat navs. At the other end of the route in Threlkend there's the noteworthy Salutation Inn. The historic pub dates all the way back to 1664 when it began life as a coaching inn. It's in a great spot with fine views up to Blencathra from the lovely south facing garden area. Inside there's a charming interior with flag stone floors, oak beams and roaring log fires. They also do good food and quality accommodation if you need to stay over. You can find the pub at a postcode of CA12 4SQ for your sat navs. It's also dog friendly if you have your four legged friend with you."

There's also a collection of historic machinery, such as locomotives and cranes, an underground tour of a realistic mine, a comprehensive geological and mining museum, and mineral panning. Just to the west you can pick up the Coledale Horseshoe. The popular circular walk starts from the village of Braithwaite, exploring the wonderful hanging valley and visiting several of the area's significant peaks on the way. The route also passes close to Force Crag Mine. The Scheduled ancient monument dates back to the 1800s and is now run by the National Trust. It's an interesting place to visit with information boards detailing the mine's history and some pleasant walks along the Coledale Beck. The route runs along a section of National Cycle Route 71 which runs from Whitehaven to Kirby Knowle through the Lake District. You could continue your outing along this signed Sustrans path."
