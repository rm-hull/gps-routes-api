With the death of Edward Castleman in 1946, the house was inherited by his niece Esther Bourke, the grandmother of the present owners Peter and Fiona Bourke."

    "description": "This walk explores the countryside around the attractive villages of Tarrant Monkton and Chettle in Cranborne Chase, Dorset. You'll also visit part of the ancient Dorset Cursus on Thickthorn Down. The circular walk starts off from the splendid Langton Arms pub in the village of Tarrant Monkton. The delightful village includes a number of picturesque thatched dwellings and lies just a couple of miles south west of the cursus. The pub dates back to the 17th century and is ideal for some pre or post walk refreshments. From here you can follow a mixture of bridleways and country lanes north east to Crichel Down and Thickthorn Down where you will find the south western end of the Dorset cursus. The route then takes you north to Tarrant Hinton Down and the village of Chettle. The village includes the Chettle Longbarrow and the noteworthy Chettle House, a Grade I listed mansion dating back to the early 1700s. You then head west and south across Launceston Down before returning to Tarrant Monkton. To explore the rest of the Cursus please see the Dorset Cursus Walk page. This walk starts from the eastern end of the earthwork at Wyke Down and visits Gussage Hill and the village of Gussage St Michael.",
