The information board states: \"Clark's Bridge is typical of those on the Grantham. Built in the late 1700s from red handmade bricks, it probably had stone copings. The blue brick copings you see today were added later. The bridge's surface is grass, forming an access track to nearby fields. Permission to build the canal was probably dependent on this type of access bridge being included. Many bridge numbers on the canal are hand painted. Clark's Bridge also has a hand painted nameplate. Both features can be seen from the towpath.\""

  "description": "This walk follows a pleasant section of the Grantham Canal and the Cross Britain Way from the village of Hickling to Harby. It's about a 5.5 mile walk to the neighbouring village, so ideal for an afternoon stroll. The village also has a fine 18th century canalside pub to relax in after your exercise. Along the way there's fine views of the lovely Vale of Belvoir countryside to enjoy. The walk starts just north of Hickling where you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it east past Clarke's Bridge to the village of Hose. The route continues to Harby where you can leave the canal and head south to explore the village and enjoy some refreshments.",
