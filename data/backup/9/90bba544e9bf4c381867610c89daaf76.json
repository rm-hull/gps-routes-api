  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Esk Valley Walk from the village of Sleights to Whitby on the North Yorkshire coast. The route runs for a distance of about 4 miles along a waymarked trail. Along the way there's some nice countryside and views of the River Esk. The route runs along the Esk Valley Railway so look out for the heritage steam trains and old stations along the way. The walk starts from Sleights train station on the Esk Valley Line. The station serves the village of Sleights, located behind the station, and the hamlet of Briggswath on the opposite side of the valley across the River Esk. From here you pick up trails on the southern side of the station and head east to Hagg House and Ruswarp where there is another station. Here you cross the river and continue into Whitby before finishing at the famous abbey on the coast. You can either return on the same paths or catch the lovely old train back to Sleights from Whitby Town or Whitby West Cliff. If you'd like to continue your waterside walking in the Sleights area then you could pick up a nice footpath heading south along the Iburndale Beck. It's located just a little south of the train station. For a longer walk try the Grosmont to Whitby Walk which also uses the Esk Valley Walk.",

      "content": "On the route you could stop off in Ruswarp and visit the Bridge Inn. The pub has a lovely garden area by the river where you can sit and watch the old steam trains go by. It's a splendid place to relax with a drink on warmer days. They are also dog friendly with a good menu and a fine selection of ales. You can find them on the High Street at a postcode of YO21 1NJ for your sat navs."
