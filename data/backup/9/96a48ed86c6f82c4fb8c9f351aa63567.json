The tramway was built to take ore from South Wheal Francis to the processing works at Basset Stamps and was worked by steam engine. The tunnel was rebuilt in 1997 to allow it to be used as part of the bridleway which runs along the old track bed and forms part of the Great Flat Lode trail."

  "description": "This is a short, circular off road walk or cycle that circles the historic hilltop site of Carn Brea . The route is one of Cornwall's Mineral Tramway Trails which take you on a tour of the disused mines of the county. You will pass South Wheal Frances and South Crofty mines as you head through some beautiful Cornish countryside. Good access points are Camborne or Redruth train stations, or the car park at Treskillard. The route runs for about 7 miles on an undulating path with some climbs on the way. If you enjoy this trail you may also be interested in the Mineral Tramways trail which runs from Portreath to Devoran and also visits several historic mine buildings.",
