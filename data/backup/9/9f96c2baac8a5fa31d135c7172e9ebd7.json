      "caption": "Blackpool Tower dates from 1894 and is a Grade I. listed building. It was commissioned by John Bickerstaff, the Town's famous Mayor, after he visited the Great Paris Exhibition in 1889 and was impressed by the Eiffel Tower. Blackpool Tower rises to 158m (518ft 9 inches) and can be seen from most places within a 30 mile radius. It houses a number of attractions not least of which is its ballroom in which dancers are accompanied by a magnificent Wurlitzer organ. This view of the Tower also illustrates the attractive Victorian ironwork that graces much of the North Pier. The security fence to the left of the kiosk surrounded an area of the Pier that was being re-decked when this photograph was taken. The crane jib on the shoreline to the right marks the reconstruction project that was taking place over much of Blackpool Promenade."

  "description": "The historic tourist town of Blackpool is situated on the Irish Sea on the Lancashire coast. There's plenty of good coastal walks, pretty parks and river trails to follow through the area. This coastal walk takes you from the town to Fleetwood using a section of the Lancashire Coastal Way. The route runs for a distance of just under 10 miles along a fairly flat, waymarked footpath. Along the way there's nice sea views and on a clear day you will even have the Lake District hills as a fine backdrop. The walk starts from the world famous Blackpool Tower which dates from the late 19th century. From here you head north passing the North Pier on your way to Bispham. The route continues past the town of Cleveleys before rounding Rossall Point and finishing in Fleetwood. In Fleetwood you can catch the ferry over to Knott End where there's more coastal walks to enjoy. You can pick up the Wyre Way around here and follow it to the Wyre Estuary Country Park where there's lots of wildlife to see.",
