  "description": "A circular walk around Lake Windermere in the beautiful Lake District. The route takes you along various footpaths and quiet lanes visiting several of the pretty settlements surrounding the lake. Starting in Bowness the route heads north along the lake before climbing up to the town of Windermere. Here you enjoy a climb to the viewpoint at Orrest Head and continue past Troutbeck Bridge to Wansfell Pike. The route then descends into the popular town of Ambleside before climbing along Loughrigg Fell to the lovely Loughrigg Tarn. The route descends to Skelwith Bridge, with its impressive waterfall and riverside tea rooms. You then pass along the western side of the lake visiting the National Trust's Wray Castle and exploring the woodland trails on Claife Heights. At the southern end of the lake you cross the River Leven at Newby Bridge and head along the eastern side of the lake. You'll pass the fine viewpoint at Gummers How before returning to Bowness.",
