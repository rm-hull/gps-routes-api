  "description": "This circular walk climbs to a splendid viewpoint from the Somerset village of Kelston. The walk starts in Kelston village and follows footpaths north east to Coombe Barn. You can then pick up a section of the Cotswold Way to head up to the viewpoint at Prospect Hill, overlooking Bath Race Course. The route then heads south to Kelston Roundhill, an ancient barrow which stands at a height of 218 metres. From here there are excellent views to the cities of Bath and Bristol, and over the Severn bridges to the Black Mountains of Wales. To the east you can also see the rolling hills of the Wiltshire Downs and the Mendip Hills are visible to the south. After taking in the views the route then continues south east past Dean Hill before turning south west toward Dean Hill House. From here it is a short descent back into Kelston village.",

Just a mile to the west there's the neighbouring village of Saltford. The circular Saltford Walk uses parts of the Bristol and Bath Railway Path, the River Avon Trail and the Two Rivers Way to visit the Kelston Brass Mills, Avon Valley Country Park and the riverside town of Keynsham. A couple of miles to the south there's the noteworth village of Newton St Loe. The settlement includes the attractive Newton College and Newton Park where there's an 18th-century landscaped garden, designed by the famous landscape gardener Capability Brown. There's also a historic 18th century country house and a fine 17th century pub to see too. For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks page."
