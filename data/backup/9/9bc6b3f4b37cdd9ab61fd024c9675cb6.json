  "description": "Explore 480 acres of woodland, farmland and moorland in this country park near Paisley. There are a number of way-marked walking and cycling paths running through the park. You can also enjoy fabulous views of Paisley, the Lower Clyde Valley and Ben Lomond from the popular viewpoint. If you head to the eastern end of the park you will find Gleniffer Burn, waterfalls near Braemount, the Glenburn Reservoir and Thornley Dam. Also of interest is the 50 ft deep Gleniffer Gorge on the Tannahill walkway and the Craigielinn waterfall where icicles can be seen hanging in the winter months. Gleniffer Braes is located just to the south of Paisley, about 7 miles west of Glasgow.",

      "content": "Just to the north of the park are a couple of interesting places which you could visit if you have time. First there's the Durrockstock Park Local Nature Reserve where you'll find a pretty lake and some easy walking trails. Flora and fauna includes swans and ducks on the water with bluebells and other pretty wildflowers to see around the park. Right next to the reserve there is also Stanley Reservoir. There's a nice path around the water with views of Stanley Castle which was once held by the Earls of Glasgow until it was sold onto Paisley Water. A few miles east of the park you will find Pollok Country Park. It's a beautiful park with footpaths and cycle trails to try. It's a lovely spot and was named the best park in Britain in 2006 and in 2008, was named the best park in Europe."
