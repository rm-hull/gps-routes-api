  "description": "Explore 480 acres of woodland, farmland and moorland in this country park near Paisley.  There are a number of way-marked walking and cycling paths running through the park. You can also enjoy fabulous views of Paisley, the Lower Clyde Valley and Ben Lomond from the popular viewpoint.  If you head to the eastern end of the park you will find Gleniffer Burn, waterfalls near Braemount, the Glenburn Reservoir and Thornley Dam. Also of interest is the 50 ft deep Gleniffer Gorge on the Tannahill walkway and the Craigielinn waterfall where icicles can be seen hanging in the winter months. Gleniffer Braes is located just to the south of Paisley, about 7 miles west of Glasgow.",
