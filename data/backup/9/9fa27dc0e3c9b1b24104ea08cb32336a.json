Both Ben Nevis and Ben Macdui had their fans, but it was not until the 1840s that the argument was settled. Surveyors from the Ordnance Survey spent a fair bit of time on the hill and finally calculated that Ben Nevis was just higher. The surveyors built a hut near the top, it's still there and although a roofless ruin, can be a useful shelter when snow comes in horizontally in this terrifyingly hostile environment. If you are coming up from Derry, and meet this hut, you are nearly there. Meanwhile even after the question was settled, many locals refused to believe that their hill was not the highest."

The walk starts from the Cairngorm Ski Centre car park and climbs to the summit via the Miadan Creag an Leth-choin ridge, passing Lochan Buidhe on the way. You can return the same way or head to the nearby Cairn Gorm by taking the north east path at Lochan Buidhe.",
