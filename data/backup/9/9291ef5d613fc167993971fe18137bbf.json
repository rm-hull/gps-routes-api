  "description": "Enjoy peaceful woodland and riverside trails along the Water of Tanar on this lovely Cairngorms walk. The circular walk runs for 5 miles along good waymarked paths with rushing water, little bridges, Caledonian Scots pinewood and lots of wildlife to see. It's a pretty easy waymarked walk on fairly flat paths, so nothing very challenging on the way. Look out for red squirrels, frogs, cross-bills and Capercaillie as you make your way through the glen. You can start the walk from the Glen Tanar estate visitor centre car park, next to the Bridge of Tanar. The route then follows the footpaths south along the river, passing little bridges, a boat house, weirs and the attractive woodland. After about 2.5 miles you can cross over to the other side of the water and follow different paths back to the visitor centre. To continue your walking in the area, head to Ballater and try the popular 7 Bridges Walk. Also nearby is the lovely circuit of Loch Muick and the challenging climb to Lochnagar .",

The worthy site includes a waymarked trail taking you through the woodland and along the loch which is situated in the Muir of Dinnet National Nature Reserve. The picturesque Loch of Aboyne can be found a few miles to the north east. Near here there's a bit of a hidden gem at the Dess Waterfall.
