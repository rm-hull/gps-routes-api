  "description": "This circular walk visits a spectacular 240-foot (73 m) waterfall regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of Wales. The walk begins at the car park at the foot of the waterfall and takes you past the falls and then along a footpath running next to the Afon/River Rhaeadr. You return to the start point along a country lane. The falls are surrounded by some beautiful countryside so there's ample opportunity to continue your walk. There is a B&B and a cafe near the falls so you can also refresh yourself after the walk. The challenging climb to Cadair Berwyn also starts from Pistyll Rhaeadr so you could head north along this footpath for great views of the area.",

      "content": "Head to the on site cafe for some refreshments after your walk. The restaurant seats 38 people indoors and there is also outdoor bench seating for about the same number. There is an attractive pagoda outside overlooking the waterfall. The menu includes breakfasts, sandwiches, baked potatoes and snacks, as well as main course meals and chef's special menu. There's also an ice cream window in the summer if you fancy a sweet treat.  Pictured above, the Tan-y-Pistyll Caf\u00e9 at the foot of the falls. A lovely waterside spot where you can relax after your exercise. You could also head into the nearby village of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant. Here you'll find The Hand public house which is a nice old style place to visit. You can find it in the village at a postcode of SY10 0JJ for your sat navs. There's also some nice paths along the River Rhaeadr to try in the village, if you fancy another stroll. To the south west you could pay a visit to the worthy village of Llangynog. The attractive settlement sits in fine scenic spot at the confluence of the Rivers Tanat and Eirth. The New Inn is a walker friendly inn serving good quality food which you can enjoy around the log fires in the cosy interior. If the weather is good then the garden area is a great place to relax. They also provide accommodation if you would like to stay in this lovely area. You can find them on Berwyn Street at a postcode of SY10 0EX for your sat navs."

      "content": "The falls are located a few miles from another major highlight of the area at Lake Vyrnwy. It's a great place for cycling and walking with nice footpaths at the southern end of the water near the visitor centre, including a sculpture trail. There's also woodland trails on both the western and eastern side of the lake. You can find the lake about 7 miles south west of the falls, near Llandwddyn. It's an excellent place to extend your outing if you have time. The Llandrillo Walk visits the falls from the village to the north. The walk route takes you to the falls via Moel Pearce, Cadair Bronwen, Cadair Berwyn and the ancient Moel Ty Uchaf stone circle. The village itself is well worth exploring with several listed buildings and views of the River Dee."
