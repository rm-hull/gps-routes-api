  "description": "This walk visits the Thornton Viaduct in the Thornton area of Bradford . The walk starts just to the west of the village at Close Head Row. From here you can pick up a section of the Great Northern trail, a shared cycling and walking trail. This will take you south east along a dismantled railway line to the viaduct. The structure is 300 yards (270 m) long and has 20 arches. It was part of the GNR's Queensbury Lines running between Queensbury and Keighley. It stopped carrying passengers in 1955 but remained open to goods until the 1960s. From here there are fine views over the surrounding area from the elevated position of the viaduct. The route then continues for another mile before finishing just outside Queensbury.",
