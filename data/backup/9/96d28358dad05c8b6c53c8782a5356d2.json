  "description": "This walk visits the Thornton Viaduct in the Thornton area of Bradford. The walk starts just to the west of the village at Close Head Row. From here you can pick up a section of the Great Northern trail, a shared cycling and walking trail. This will take you south east along a dismantled railway line to the viaduct. The structure is 300 yards (270 m) long and has 20 arches. It was part of the GNR's Queensbury Lines running between Queensbury and Keighley. It stopped carrying passengers in 1955 but remained open to goods until the 1960s. From here there are fine views over the surrounding area from the elevated position of the viaduct. The route then continues for another mile before finishing just outside Queensbury.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area head north to Hewenden Reservoir and Viaduct. This structure formed part of the Keighley and Thornton Branch of the Great Northern Railway and is also worth seeing. Both viaducts also form part of the Great Northern Railway Trail which runs from Queensbury to Cullingworth. Near the trail you can also visit the lovely Goit Stock Waterfall. There's some nice peaceful woodland trails here around the rushing falls. On the south western outskirts of the city there's Horton Bank Country Park to visit. The park includes a nice lakeside trail and a viewpoint with fine views over the city and the surrounding Yorkshire Dales. The picturesque Chellow Dene Reservoir is also located near here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks and the Nidderdale Walks pages."
