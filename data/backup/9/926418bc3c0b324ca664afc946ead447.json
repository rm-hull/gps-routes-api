  "description": "This walk visits Banton Loch on the lovely Colzium Estate near Kilsyth. There's some peaceful trails from the western side of the water with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. On the southern side of the loch look out for the cairn commemorating the 1645 Battle of Kilsyth. After exploring the lochside paths you can head to the historic Colzium House where there are more nice trails around the grounds and gardens. The site includes the ruins of the 16th century castle, a visitor centre, garden cafe and a walled garden. The loch is also known as Townhead Reservoir and was built in 1773 as a feeder loch for the Forth and Clyde Canal .",

Just to the north west of the water there's the Loup of Fintry where you'll find beautiful 94ft high waterfalls. You can also pick up the more challenging Meikle Bin Trail in this area. The city of Stirling with its impressive castle and nearby North Third Reservoir are also worth visiting. In Cumbernauld to the south there's the splendid Palacerigg Country Park, Fannyside Lochs and Broadwood Loch to explore. For more walking ideas in the area see the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs Walks page."
