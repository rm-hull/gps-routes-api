  "description": "This little village is located in a lovely spot, near the mouth of the River Severn in South Gloucestershire. There's good waterside footpaths, a fine local pub and a notable church. The historic old church is well worth a visit as it sits on a hill with fine views over the area. This walk from the Oldbury on Severn takes you along the Severn Estuary to the neighbouring town of Berkeley and its historic castle. The estuary is also a great place for birdwatching so keep your eyes peeled for a variety of waders. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Severn Way and follow the waymarked footpath west along Oldbury Pill. The little creek has lots of little boats leading down to the Severn. The route then turns north to head along the river where there are excellent views across the Welsh side. The route will take you past a Tidal Reservoir and Oldbury Power Station before coming to Berkeley Power Station. Here you leave the river and follow footpaths along Berkeley Pill before finishing at Berkeley Castle. The Grade I listed castle has a fascinating history dating back to the 11th century. There's also some beautiful grounds and gardens to stroll around before heading back to Oldbury on the same paths. In the town there's also the fascinating Edward Jenner Museum where you can learn all about the birthplace of vaccination.",
