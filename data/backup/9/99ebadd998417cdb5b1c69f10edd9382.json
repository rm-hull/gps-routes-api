  "description": "This walk in London follows the course of an old railway line running between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Park. The whole route is actually a local nature reserve and is the longest of its type in London. With lots of flora and fauna to look out for on the way, it's a great place to enjoy an easy stroll in an urban environment. Keep your eyes peeled for wildlife including hedgehogs, foxes and also butterflies around the many wildflowers you can see on the route. In fact, more than three hundred species of wild flowers have been recorded on the Parkland Walk. The walk starts from the western end of Finsbury Park, just to the north of Finsbury Park station. You can enjoy a walk around the public park before you start. It contains a pretty lake, open ground, formal gardens, avenues of mature trees and an arboretum. After leaving the park the route heads west to Crouch End. On this section look out for the old station master's house which still survives at road level. There are no longer any trace of the track or road-side station buildings, which were destroyed in a fire in 1967. You can also visit Crouch Hill Park and look out for the old platforms of Crouch End Station which are still visible, though somewhat overgrown. The route then continues on nice woodland trails through Queen's Wood and Highgate Wood. The final section takes you through Muswell Hill to Alexandra Park before finishing at Alexandra Palace. The park is also a nice place to extend your exercise. It includes a boating lake, a Victorian style greenhouse, a deer enclosure with a small herd of fallow deer and a 10 hole pitch and putt golf course.",
