Unlike most Roman forts which are of decidedly square shape, this one follows the lines of the peninsula on which it was built. Originally the sea lapped against its walls but it is now nearly a mile away. The Normans used the fort for their overnight camp before the Battle of Hastings and soon after built the castle (seen here) in a corner of the fort. The castle was further fortified in World War II."

  "description": "This walk takes you around the historic Pevensey Castle in East Sussex. The site has a fascinating history stretching back to the 4th century when it was originally a Roman fortification. It is also notable as the place where the Norman Conquest of England began, when William the Conqueror landed there on 28 September 1066. As such it marks the start of the 1066 Country Walk which visits several of the sites associated with the invasion and the subsequent Battle of Hastings. Today you can explore the ancient ruins of the Norman castle and its surrounding grounds on pleasant footpaths. After exploring the castle you can pick up a waterside section of the 1066 Country Walk and follow the waymarked footpath north along the Pevensey Haven to Rickney. The river will take you into the Pevensey Levels, an area of marshland that cover an area of around 47 square miles. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and nature reserve with many rare species of plant to see.",
