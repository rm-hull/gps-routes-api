  "description": "This Norfolk based village is located close to Kings Lynn in the western part of the county. The highlight of the area is the same named 12th century castle. This walk from the village visits the historic castle before heading west to explore the woodland trails at Ling Common in North Wooton. The walk starts from the car park next to the English Heritage owned Castle Rising Castle. For a fee you can explore the castle and the 20 acres of earthworks that surround it. You can also climb the gatehouse and enjoy wonderful views over the village below. The castle has an interesting history having been originally built in the 12th century. In the 14th century it became the luxurious residence of Queen Isabella, widow (and alleged murderess) of Edward II. After exploring the castle grounds you head north through the little village before turning west along country lanes and footpaths. These will lead you to Ling Common where there are some peaceful woodland trails to follow. After exploring the common the route returns to the castle on the same paths.",

      "content": "To continue your walking head south west and pick up the King's Lynn and The Walks route. This visits a fine urban park before a riverside stroll along the Great Ouse. Near here you can also visit Bawsey Country Park. There's good trails here to follow around around birch covered hills and a Scandinavian style lake. The purple heather and Dartmoor ponies on Roydon Common are also in this area. Just to the north of the village you'll find Sandringham Country Park. The expansive park surrounds the Queen's famous country retreat. In the park you'll find miles of excellent woodland and parkland walking trails. On the western side of the estate you'll also find the interesting village of Wolferton. Here you can visit the noteworthy Wolferton Railway Station. The now disused station was well known during the 1800\u2019s through its association with the Royal Family who used the station because of its proximity to Sandringham House. There are also trails to pick up around the Dersingham Bog Nature Reserve in this area. The reserve is part of the wider Sandringham Royal Estate and includes attractive heathland with interesting flora and fauna to see. A few miles south east of the village is another of the historical highlights of the area at Castle Acre. Here you'll find the atmospheric ruins of and 11th century castle and priory. There's also some lovely waterside trails along the River Nar through the picture postcard village. The attractive village of Great Massingham and the historic Houghton Hall gardens can be found just to the north. You could also head to the coast at nearby Snettisham. There's a lovely beach and an RSPB nature reserve with lots of wildlife to see here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Walks page."
