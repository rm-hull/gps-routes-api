  "description": "This Norfolk based village is located close to Kings Lynn in the western part of the county. The highlight of the area is the same named 12th century castle. This walk from the village visits the historic castle before heading west to explore the woodland trails at Ling Common in North Wooton. The walk starts from the car park next to the English Heritage owned Castle Rising Castle . For a fee you can explore the castle and the 20 acres of earthworks that surround it. You can also climb the gatehouse and enjoy wonderful views over the village below. The castle has an interesting history having been originally built in the 12th century. In the 14th century it became the luxurious residence of Queen Isabella, widow (and alleged murderess) of Edward II. After exploring the castle grounds you head north through the little village before turning west along country lanes and footpaths. These will lead you to Ling Common where there are some peaceful woodland trails to follow. After exploring the common the route returns to the castle on the same paths.",
