  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around Loch Morlich in the Cairngorms. There is a good footpath running all the way around the water and through the surrounding forest. It's a popular, waymarked walk with ample parking at the visitor centre located at the north eastern end of the lake. The trail runs for just under 4 miles on a fairly flat footpath with a few small climbs along the way. There's much to enjoy with a beautiful, long beach, peaceful woodland trails and the wonderful backdrop of the Cairngorms mountains. You can extend your walk by further exploring the surrounding Glenmore Forest Park .",

      "content": "Head north west of the loch and you can enjoy another waterside walk around Loch Pityoulish. It's a smaller loch but nonetheless very pretty and a more tranquil and peaceful place with fewer visitors than Morlich. If you head east from the visitor centre you could visit the unusual Green Loch. The small lake is a popular spot to visit in the park with its photogenic turquoise hue. The popular town of Aviemore is located a few miles north west of the site. The town makes a good base for walking with Craigellachie Nature Reserve a nearby highlight. Near Kincraig there's Loch Insh which includes a watersports centre and an old lochside church. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
