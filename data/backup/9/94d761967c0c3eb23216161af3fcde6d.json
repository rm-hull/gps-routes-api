  "description": "Visit this fascinating ruined abbey before exploring the surrounding countryside of Ryedale. There's interesting history, peaceful woodland trails, moderate hill climbs and splendid North York Moors scenery to enjoy on the way. The circular walk starts at the abbey where you will find extensive ruins of the 12th century buildings. Highlights include the nave, the fine rose window, the brightly coloured medieval floor tiles and the cloister and warming house. After exploring the abbey site you head towards Wass, before following woodland trails through Abbey Bank Wood and Snever Wood to the Oldstead Observatory. The tower was built in 1838 to commemorate Queen Victoria's coronation. The route then leaves the woods, passing the village of Olstead and picking up country trails to lead you back to the abbey. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments in the lovely Stapylton Arms pub in the nearby village of Wass. The abbey is located close to the very popular Sutton Bank and the Kilburn White Horse. With fabulous views and some dramatic scenery it's a great place to extend your walking in the area. The area includes the pretty Gormire Lake which has a nice footpath around the perimeter. The circular Felixkirk Walk visits the lake and hill from the nearby village. You can also explore the Hambleton Hills by picking up the trail from the Kilburn White Horse car park.",
