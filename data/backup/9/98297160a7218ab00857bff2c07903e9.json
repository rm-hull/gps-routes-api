  "description": "This lovely large area of heathland has some nice walking trails to try. The best time to visit is in late summer when the beautiful purple heather is out. The common is also a nature reserve so look out for a variety of wildlife as you make your way along the paths. Highlights include over 30 species of butterfly and Dartmoor Ponies which can be seen grazing on the common. There's also some nice woodland trails with birds such as\u00a0nightjars and woodlarks to keep an eye out for. The reserve is located a few miles north east of King's Lynn where you can pick up a number of different walks. Just to the south of the reserve you can visit Bawsey Pits Country Park where there are nice trails around birch covered hills and a Scandinavian style lake.",
