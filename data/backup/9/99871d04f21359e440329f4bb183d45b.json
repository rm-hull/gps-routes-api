  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this ancient royal hunting forest in Bishop's Stortford, Essex. There are over 1000 acres to explore on a multitude of peaceful woodland paths. These include two waymarked walking routes and the Flitch Way cycle route which runs along a decomissioned railway line in the northern part of the forest. Cycle hire is available at reasonable rates. Park highlights include the many resident deer, the large lake where you can hire row boats and the waterside Georgian Shell House where you can get a bite to eat. The Harcamlow Way, Forest Way and the Three Forests Way walking trails run through the forest. You can pick up these long distance trails to continue your walk.",

      "content": "The Great Dunmow Walk visits the forest from the nearby market town. It follows the Flitch Way from the town centre to the park. Just a couple of miles to the north east there's some more pleasant trails around Birchanger Wood near Bishop's Stortford. Just north of here there's the interesting village of Stansted Mountfitchet. The village includes a number of interesting local attractions including a church dating from the 12th-13th century, an 18th century windmill and a toy museum which claims to be the largest in the world. There's also the noteworthy Mountfitchet Castle which is now run as a wonderful Living History Museum where you can experience life as a villager in 1066. For more walking ideas in the area see the Essex Walks page."
