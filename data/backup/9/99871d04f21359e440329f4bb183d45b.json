  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this ancient royal hunting forest in Bishop's Stortford, Essex. There are over 1000 acres to explore on a multitude of peaceful woodland paths.  These include two waymarked walking routes and the Flitch Way cycle route which runs along a decomissioned railway line in the northern part of the forest. Cycle hire is available at reasonable rates. Park highlights include the many resident deer, the large lake where you can hire row boats and the waterside Georgian Shell House where you can get a bite to eat. The Harcamlow Way , Forest Way and the Three Forests Way walking trails run through the forest. You can pick up these long distance trails to continue your walk.",
