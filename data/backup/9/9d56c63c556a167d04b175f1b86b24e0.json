  "description": "This wonderful trail runs from Helmsley to Filey, taking you through the beautiful North York Moors national park, atop the Hambleton Hills ridge and along the stunning North Yorkshire coastline. The trail begins in Helmsley, with the first section taking you through the heather moorland of the North York Moors, passing the village of Osmotherley, the pretty Cod Beck Reservoir and the ancient stones at Lord Stones Country Park and the Wainstones. After enjoying the fabulous views on the elevated moors you arrive at Saltburn to begin the coastal stretch. You then pass through a series of lovely coastal towns, including Whitby, Robin's Hood Bay and Scarborough, while enjoying some of the most spectacular coastal scenery in the country. The trail is coincident with the Lyke Wake Walk for a long section around around Osmotherley. This challenging walk is a complete crossing of the North Yorkshire Moors from west to east. For circular walks along the trail try the splendid Great Ayton Circular Walk, Sandsend Circular Walk, the Sutton Bank and the Kilburn White Horse Walk, the Osmotherley Circular Walk or the Wainstones Walk .",
