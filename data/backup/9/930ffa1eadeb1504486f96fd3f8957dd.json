    "description": "This circular walk takes you through the lovely Langstrath Valley in the Borrowdale area of the Lake District. The route runs for about 10 miles, following footpaths, tracks and country lanes on either side of the Langstrath Beck. On the walk you'll pass a series of lovely waterfalls with fine views of the surrounding hills throughout. The route starts from Rosthwaite where there is a National Trust car park a few miles south of Derwentwater. From here you can pick up the Cumbria Way and follow it south along the Stonethwaite Beck. You'll pass Galleny Falls, Smithymire Island and Stonethwaite Fell before crossing to the other side of the beck. The paths then lead you north to the village of Stonethwaite before returning to Rosthwaite. After your exercise you can enjoy refreshments at the 18th century Royal Oak Hotel which is very walker friendly. To continue your walking in the area try our Circular Walk from Rosthwaite which starts from the same car park. The lovely route visits the picturesque Watendlath Tarn and Dock Tarn.",
