  "description": "This walk takes you along a section of the Dart Valley Trail from Kingswear to the National Trust's Greenway House The fine Georgian mansion is famous as the holiday home to famous crime writer \u00a0Agatha Christie. It's just under 4 miles from the village to the house, passing along a steadily rising waymarked footpath. At the end of the walk you have the option of catching the Dartmouth Steam Railway back to Kingswear from\u00a0Greenway Halt\u00a0station. Start the walk from Kingswear village and follow the trail north along the picturesque Dartmouth Harbour on the River Dart. You'll pass the Marina and Quay at Lower Noss Point before a woodland section through Cart Wood and Long Wood. There's a moderate climb here to Oakham Hill before you descend to Greenway House. For a fee you can explore the house and grounds which include Walled gardens, peaceful woodland, a Camellia Garden, Fernery and riverside paths. You can also visit the boathouse, scene of the crime in Christie's mystery Dead Man's Folly. Inside the fine Georgian House there's also a collection of ceramics, Tunbridgeware, silver, and books, including first editions of her novels. For a longer circular walk you can try the Dartmouth to Dittisham Walk where you catch the Greenway ferry to Dittisham on the opposite side of the river.
