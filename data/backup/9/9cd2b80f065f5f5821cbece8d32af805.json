  "description": "Explore 100 acres of woodland, gardens and lakes in this beautiful arboretum near Bedale in North Yorkshire. It's perfect for an easy afternoon stroll with a series of good footpaths including tree trails, a nature trail and a children's trail. There's lovely grassy paths, glades, bays, and avenues connecting the different sections of the arboretum. There's a wonderful collection of rare trees and plants from China, Japan, North America, Chile, and Europe.  In spring there are daffodils, wild flowers and bluebells while in the summer the hydrangeas are in full bloom. In autumn the colours of the trees create a spectacular natural fireworks display. The site also includes a wonderful Bird of Prey and Mammal Centre with one of the largest collections of birds of prey in the north of England. These include eagles, falcons, hawks, vultures and owls with experts giving flying demonstrations. To extend your walk you can head into Bedale and enjoy a peaceful stroll along the delightful Bedale Beck.",
