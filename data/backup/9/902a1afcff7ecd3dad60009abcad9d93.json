There is evidence of quarrying having taken place here in the past."

Pen Cerrig Calch is the southern end of the western Black Mountains ridge. Sugar Loaf and Blorenge are in the background. The summit and the ridge linking it with Pen Allt Mawr pretty much fills this square. The vegetation is scrubby grassland interspersed with those rocks. It's a lot drier ground than most of the Black Mountains."

  "description": "This walk climbs to Pen Cerrig Calch from the town of Crickhowell in the Black Mountains area of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The hill is a subsidiary summit of Waun Fach which lies a few miles to the north. The walk follows a section of the long distance Cambrian Way from the pretty riverside town to the summit. Start the walk in Crickhowell and follow the waymarked trail north east towards Table Mountain. Here you will find some interesting geology and the fortification of Crug Hywel, a presumed Iron Age hillfort. You continue north to the Pen Cerrig Calch summit which stands at a height of 701 metres. From here you can enjoy some wonderful views over the surrounding mountains of the Brecon Beacons including Sugar Loaf and Blorenge. There's also more interesting geology with limestone rock formations to see.",
