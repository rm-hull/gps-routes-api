  "description": "This walk takes you to the unusually coloured Green Loch (An Lochan Uaine) near Aviemore in the Glenmore Forest Park. The small lake is a popular spot to visit with its photogenic turquoise hue. You can start the walk from the visitor centre at the Glenmore Forest Park where there is a car parking area. From here you can follow woodland trails north east for about 1.5 miles to the loch. It's a lovely tranquil place with footpaths up to a fine wooden viewing platform on the side of the loch. In folklore it's also known as the Faerie Loch, as its green colour was due to the faeries washing their clothing in the waters.",

      "content": "Head west from the visitor centre and there's more nice waterside trails along Loch Morlich. Just west of Aviemore there's the wonderful Craigellachie Nature Reserve. The reserve includes a series of lochans, fascinating plantlife and a wonderful viewpoint towards the nearby Cairn Gorm. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
