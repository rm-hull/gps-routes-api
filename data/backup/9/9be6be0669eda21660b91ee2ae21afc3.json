Rather than replacing it in the 1920's the ironwork was replaced with steel and the towers restored. All Saints Church was built on the site of an earlier one and completed in 1835. The rebuilt spire was restored in 1990-93."

  "description": "This easy riverside walk takes you from Marlow to Hurley along the Thames Path. The route runs for a distance of just over 2 miles on a flat waymarked path. As such it's perfect for a pleasant afternoon stroll. The walk starts on Marlow Bridge and heads east past the delightful Higginson Park which is worth a small detour. The riverside park is a popular local attraction with its pretty gardens and maze. The path continues to Temple Lock and Temple Lock Island. It's a noteworthy and scenic spot on the river, having first built by the Thames Navigation Commissioners in 1773. Shortly after passing the lock you come to Hurley Lock, another significant and picturesque lock on the Thames. Here the river splits into a number of channels with several weirs between wooded islands. Just to the south of the lock you can stroll into the small village of Hurley. You'll pass the historic remains of Hurley Priory, a former Benedictine priory which sits on the banks of the river. The long narrow nave of the priory church survives and is used as the Hurley parish church. It has mainly Norman windows and doorways. Also of note here is the Olde Bell Inn which dates from 1135. It is claimed to be the oldest hotel in the UK, and one of the oldest hotels in the world. The hotel is said to contain a secret tunnel leading to the village priory, which was used by John Lovelace, who was involved in the Glorious Revolution to overthrow King James II in the 17th century. The hotel was also used as a meeting point for Winston Churchill and Dwight D. Eisenhower during World War II. It's well worth exploring the whole site as other features include a kitchen garden, wildflower garden and a 16th century Tithe Barn. The inn is located close to Pinewood Studios and over the years, has seen a number of movie-star guests, including Mae West, Greta Garbo, Cary Grant, Errol Flynn, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. After exploring Hurley you can return to Marlow the same way or turn it into a circular walk by heading north from Temple lock into the countryside. You could then pick up Lower Pound Lane and follow it back to Marlow, via Higginson Park. To extend the walk you could continue onto Henley on our Marlow to Henley Walk .",
