Participants are pulled around on a continuous cable and there can be up to eight people using it at once. This person is using a wakeboard - by far the most common type of equipment - which allows the more confident individuals to perform spectacular acrobatics with varying degrees of success. The building in the background houses changing rooms, a pro's shop and a bar."

The course of the river was moved in the 1950's to alleviate frequent flooding problems. This bit was left behind to provide local factories with a source of water in the event of fire. The photo looks south-west towards Woodhouse. An easy walk from this square can be taken to the Country Park."

  "description": "Rother Valley Country Park is located near Sheffield and is an excellent place for a peaceful waterside walk or cycle. Here you will find 5 pretty lakes, views of the River Rother and a nature reserve which boasts the recording of over 260 different varieties of birds over the past two decades. Three excellent Rother Valley bike trails of varying difficulty have been created while there is also on site cycle hire available. Click here for details. For walkers there is an extensive network of Nature trails for all abilities. These include an interesting sculpture trail and an easy lakeside route. Please click here for more information. To extend your walking in the area we recommend heading to nearby Maltby to visit Roche Abbey. The site is located just to the south of the town and includes some fascinating 12th century ruins set in beautiful parkland. The Sheffield Country Walk also passes through the park. The circular long distance trail is a great way of extending your walking in the area. Following it a short distance north would take you to Treeton Dyke where there's more fine waterside trails to try.",

      "content": "To the north east of the park there's some more waterside trails around the pretty Langold Lake Country Park. The 300 acre park includes woodland, a nature reserve and a water park. Near here there's also Hodsock Priory to explore. The historic park is open to the public in February for the annual snowdrop walks. All year round you can explore the wider estate on a circular public footpath though. The Eckington Walk starts in the nearby town and follows the Trans Pennine Trail to the park. The route includes a disused section of the Chesterfield Canal. The town includes the splendid Renishaw Hall where there are some beautiful grounds and gardens surrounding the old hall. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Walks page."
