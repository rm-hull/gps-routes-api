  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk along this disused railway line between Waterford and Dungarvan . The route runs for about 46km along a multi user path with fine views of the River Suir, the River Mahon and the coast to enjoy. Starting in Waterford the route runs past Mount Congreve, Kilmeaden and Kilmacthomas. This interesting town lies on the River Mahon and includes the noteworthy Kilmacthomas Viaduct. The final section runs along the beautiful Copper Coast, a geopark which extends for some 17 km from Kilfarrasy in the east to Stradbally in the west.",
