  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Binevenagh in the Keenaght Hills of County Londonderry. The hill is part of the wider Binevenagh Area of Special Scientific Interest and Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The reserve includes some impressive geological features and lots of interesting plantlife. There's also grazing animals including bulls, cows, ponies & sheep. You can start the walk from the car park at Binevenagh Lake. You'll then pass along the water before exploring the woodland trails in the Binevenagh Forest. Just north west of the lake there's also a climb to Binevenagh View where there are some fine views to the nearby Lough Foyle. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit Roe Valley Country Park near Limavady. The park includes riverside trails, pretty waterfalls, spectacular gorges and attractive woodland.",
