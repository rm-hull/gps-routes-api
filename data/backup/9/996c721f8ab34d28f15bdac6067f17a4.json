  "description": "This walk takes you through the delightful Gwaun Valley, near Fishguard. The steep sided valley includes riverside paths, attractive woodland, water meadows and pretty bluebells in the spring. This walk runs from Llanychaer to Pontfaen on fairly flat paths, for a distance of about 2.5 miles (so just over 5 miles there and back). The walk starts from Llanychaer and follows footpaths east along the Afon Gwaun. You'll pass the woodland of Tre-llwyn Wood where you can look out for a variety of woodland bids including like redstarts, nuthatches and sparrowhawks. The route also passes Llanychaer churchyard where you can see the 1200 year old Crucifixion Stone. To extend your walking in the area you can head to Fishguard and pick up the wonderful Pembrokeshire Coast Path. If you follow it north east it will take you to Dinas Head. The lovely headland commands great views over Fishguard Bay.",
