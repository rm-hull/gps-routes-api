      "caption": "The windmill seen from the south in the December of 2005. The structure is often claimed to be England's most unusual windmill since it was designed as an architectural landmark as much as a functioning mill. The current machinery dates from 1860 and was used until about 1910 before gradually becoming derelict. The mill was restored to working order between 1965 and 1971 and is now owned by Warwickshire County Council. Open days are held for members of the public to visit the mill, although these had to cancelled during the early part of 2001 when the windmill lost two of its sails in a storm. As can be seen from the picture these have now been repaired."

  "description": "This walk visits a 17th century windmill near Harbury in Warwickshire. The Grade I listed mill is a well known local landmark and the earliest tower mill in England to retain any of its working parts. You can start the walk from the roadside parking close the mill. It's located on Windmill Hill Lane just to the west of Harbury. From here you can directly access a footpath leading up to the windmill. It's about a half mile walk there and back, taking place on a fairly flat grassy path. The mill is in a nice position surrounded by some lovely Warwickshire countryside. There are also views to a Roman settlement in the adjacent field, to the north west of the mill.",
