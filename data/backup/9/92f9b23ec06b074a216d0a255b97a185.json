  "description": "This walk visits the Iron Age hill fort of Figsbury Ring near the city of Salisbury in Wiltshire. The remote site is located just a few miles north east of Salisbury . You can start your walk from the on site car park and then follow footpaths west up to the hill top. From here you can enjoy some glorious views over the countryside to Salisbury Plain and the city with its famous cathedral. It's particularly lovely in the warmer months when you can see butterflies and skylarks around the pretty wildflowers. The Monarch's Way crosses the hill. You could pick up this waymarked trail and follow it north west to visit the nearby villages of Winterbourne Dauntsey and Winterbourne Gunner. Head south east takes you across Winterbourne Down to Middle Winterslow.",
