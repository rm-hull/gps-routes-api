Blackdown is the highest point in both the historic county of Sussex and the South Downs National Park. It is also one of the highest points in the south east of England, exceeded by Walbury Hill and Leith Hill. There are several footpaths from the surrounding villages including a steep walk up the southern escarpment from Lurgashall. Blackdown is also well known as the site of the poet Tennyson's houses, Aldworth and Foxholes. Keen to escape the summer 'trippers' who came to his Isle of Wight home, Farringford House, Tennyson purchased Blackdown, and built Aldworth in 1869.   There are three National Trust car parks at the site and the Sussex Border Path can also be picked up here."

  "description": "This walk runs from Haslemere to Petersfield through the beautiful Sussex greensand hills. The path takes its name both from its serpentine shape and from passing through the habitat of all three British species of snake. The route crosses many heathland areas and heads along the greensand ridges in the western Weald, visiting Liphook, Milland, Fernhurst, Petworth Park, Fittleworth, Duncton, Burton Mill Pond, Heyshott, Midhurst, Stedham and Nyewood before reaching the serpent's tail at Petersfield Lake and Heath in Hampshire. The trail is waymarked with white plastic discs showing a snake in the approximate shape of the route on a purple triangle. Route highlights include a climb to the highest point on the South Downs at Black Down in West Sussex. You'll also visit the pretty Iping and Stedham Commons near Midhurst.",
