  "description": "This circular cycle and walking trail takes you around Cardiff Bay along part of Sustrans National Cycle Route 8. On the way you will pass the bay's numerous caf\u00e9s, pubs, heritage sites and the International Sports Village. The ride also crosses Pont y Werin (The People's Bridge). This pedestrian and cyclist bridge was opened in 2010 and spans the River Ely between Cardiff Bay and Penarth. Along the way there's lots of pretty marinas and often historic some tall ships to see too. Other highlights include the civil engineering marvel of the Cardiff Bay Barrage and the wildlife rich Cardiff Bay Wetlands Reserve. There is a boardwalk here where you can look out for birds including common reed buntings, reed warblers and sedge warblers. Also look out for the 19th century Pierhead Building, a Grade I listed building formerly used as the head office for the Great Western Railway. The route runs for just under 5 miles on flat surfaced paths. You can continue your exercise in the city on the popular Taff Trail which will take you along the River Taff.",
