  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Applecross peninsula, north-west of Kyle of Lochalsh in Wester Ross, Scottish Highlands. You can start the walk from the car park at Applecross Bay and then follow the quiet coastal road north to Sand where there is a nice beach. The walk then returns through the hills where you can enjoy some splendid views to Raasay, Skye and Rona. The area is also great for wildlife with red deer, pine martens, otters, water voles, adders, blue hare, foxes, a rare wildcat and pipistrelle bats. Birds include tawny and barn owls, white tailed and golden eagles, great skua, arctic tern, great spotted woodpeckers, song thrush, bullfinches, golden plover, skylark, merlin, greenshank, dunlin, red and, occasionally, the rarer black grouse, dotterel, and rock ptarmigan. There also plenty of marine life with common seals near the shore, as well as basking sharks, minke whales, porpoises, and bottlenose dolphins. To continue your walking in the area head south to the delightful village of Plockton where you can enjoy fine views over Lochcarron .",
