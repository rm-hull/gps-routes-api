This picture, taken on the northern, top path shows Yew tree roots growing through the clints in the magnesian limestone. The gorge is renowned for its unique geological and ecological features. It stands out as one of the finest examples of gorges within the Creswell Limestone Heritage Area. The landscape is characterised by Magnesium Limestone cliffs, which host distinctive rare plants, animals, and ancient woodlands. Notably, limestone from this area was used in the reconstruction of the Houses of Parliament after the 1834 fire."

Archaeologists also discovered bones of Ice Age animals, such as reindeer and hyena, highlighting the area's rich prehistoric significance. To visit Dead Man's Cave, start from the Anston Parish Hall car park and follow the well-marked path to the gorge. At the fork, take the higher path, leading to a mini gorge with unexcavated rock shelters and fissures. Just before the path descends, take the right fork to reach the edge of the limestone cliff. The left path descends to the cave/rock shelter."
