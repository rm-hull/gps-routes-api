  "description": "This circular walk from Coulsdon South train station makes use of some of the area's waymarked footpaths to take you on a tour of the hills, countryside and woods to the south of Coulsdon. The route run for just over 8 miles and is a great way to enjoy some nice North Downs scenery from the outskirts of London. Starting from the train station you immediately pick up the London Loop and follow it south across Farthing Downs . The downs are a large area of chalk grassland surrounded by attractive woodland and countryside. The trail then leads through Happy Valley Park where you will find Devilsden Wood and more chalk grassland with interesting flora such as the rare man orchid and round-headed rampion. You then branch of to the east to visit Coulsdon Common. The (127 acre) public open space has some nice woodland and grassland to explore. The path continues past Dean Hill and Piles Wood before coming to Chaldon. Near here you pick up a section of the North Downs Way . Follow this west past Hilltop Farm before picking up the Downland Circular Walk. This will take you north past Tollsworth Manor, a 15th Century Grade II listed house with a 17th and 19th century extension. The final section takes you north past Alderstead Heath to return to Farthing Downs and the train station. To continue your walking in the area head a short way to the south and visit Mercers Country Park in Merstham. There's a nice footpath around a pretty lake to try here. If you follow the North Downs Way east you can pick up the Woldingham Circular Walk and explore the area to the south of the village. Heading west will take you to Reigate Hill and Gatton Park .",
