The walk passes through Wrington, Chew Stoke, Chew Magna, Compton Dando and Pensford with sections along the River Yeo and River Chew to enjoy. Other highlights on the route include the Stanton Drew Stones which include the Great Circle - the second largest stone circle in Britain (after Avebury Stones ). You'll also pass the lovely Chew Valley Lake which has delightful nature trails and a variety of wildlife. Near here there's also the photogenic Pensford Viaduct which is a Grade II listed building, spanning the River Chew near the attractive village of the same name. All the way there's splendid views of the Mendip Hills AONB and the Somerset countryside.",
