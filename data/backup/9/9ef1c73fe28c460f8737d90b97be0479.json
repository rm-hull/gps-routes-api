  "description": "This pretty Essex village has some nice country trails, local waterside footpaths and a noteworthy Norman church to visit. This circular walk from the village visits Little Wakering before a waterside stroll along the creeks of the River Roach to the north of the settlement. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north west to visit Little Wakering. Here you can pick up a footpath heading east along Little Wakering Creek, Fleethead Creek and Barlinghall Creek. You continue south along Potton Creek to Oxenham, passing Rushley Island on the way. At Landwick cottages you turn west to cross Great Wakering Common before returning to the village.",

To the west there's also the circular Roach Valley Way which explores the area around neighbouring Rochford. It visits Hockley Woods and passes close to the RSPB reserve on Wallasea Island. It also visits the nearby village of Paglesham which lies just to the west of the island. The village is a pleasant place for a stroll with trails along the river and Pagelsham Creek. There's also a fine 17th century pub for refreshments afterwards. For more walking ideas in the area see the Essex Walks page."
