If you look closely you may be able to see the barbed wire, intended to keep people out."

  "description": "This pretty Essex village has some nice country trails, local waterside footpaths and a noteworthy Norman church to visit. This circular walk from the village visits Little Wakering before a waterside stroll along the creeks of the River Roach to the north of the settlement. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north west to visit Little Wakering. Here you can pick up a footpath heading east along Little Wakering Creek, Fleethead Creek and Barlinghall Creek. You continue south along Potton Creek to Oxenham, passing Rushley Island on the way. At Landwick cottages you turn west to cross Great Wakering Common before returning to the village.",
