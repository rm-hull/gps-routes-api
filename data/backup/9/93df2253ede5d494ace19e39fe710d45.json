This is one of the largest tracts of heathland left in Dorset, now owned by the national Trust. Only 15 per cent of the original acreage of this rare habitat now remains in Dorset. Originally the local commoners' practice of grazing stock and gathering firewood kept the heath in this condition. Nowadays this has to be done artificially to preserve the heath and it rare flora and fauna. Thomas Hardy made this kind of heathland famous in his books such as Return of the Native."

  "description": "Enjoy a walk through beautiful Dorset heathland in this delightful National Nature Reserve near Wimborne Minster. There are miles of good walking tracks taking you through over 1000 acres of woodland and heathland. In the summer the purple heather and gorse are really beautiful. The area is also fantastic for wildlife - look out for New Forest Ponies, Dartford warbler, Curlews, various reptiles and a variety of butterflies. This circular walk starts at the Whitesheet car park and follows footpaths across the heath to Cock's Moor Pond and Newman's Lane. You then pick up the Ferndown, Stour and Forest Trail to take you back to the car park through peaceful woodland. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Castleman Trailway and head into the nearby Ferndown Forest for more peaceful woodland trails.",
