  "description": "This walk visits the expansive Lough Ramor in County Cavan. The walk starts in the town of Virginia which is located on the northern side of the lake. From here you can follow footpaths down to the lakeside where there is a park and a picnic area. Additional amenities include a small fishing/viewing pier and a boardwalk pier stretching into the lake. There is also a modestly sized children's play area. Limited space is available for parking caravans or motor homes, particularly advisable on quieter days or if arriving early. Adjacent to the lake is a Deer Park Forest, offering numerous hours of enjoyment with its various pathways leading through a picturesque forest landscape. The area also includes the Virginia Park Lodge Hotel , a truly unique 18th Century hunting estate with miles of scenic pedestrian walkways. There is a fine pub here where you can enjoy some post walk refreshments. At the lakeside you can look out for a variety of wildlife including cormorants and swans. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit the fascinating Loughcrew . This ancient site includes includes a number of tombs thought to date to the 4th millennium BC. There are great views from the hill top to enjoy here as well. Just to the west there's Lough Sheelin where there are lots of interesting birds to look out for on the water.",
