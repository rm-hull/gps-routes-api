  "description": "Climb to Elidir Fawr, the northernmost peak in the\u00a0Glyderau range on this challenging walk in Snowdonia. The walk takes you to the 924\u00a0metre (3,031\u00a0ft) summit from the village of Nant Peris at the bottom of the Llanberis Pass. It's only about a 2 mile climb, but quite steep. The walk starts from the parking areas off the A4086 in Nant Peris. Cross the A4086 and then pick up a country lane heading north. A footpath then takes you the rest of the way to the summit, passing the Afon Dudodyn on the way. There are fabulous views over the peaks and reservoirs of the national park. You can extend the walk by continuing a short way on to the pretty Marchlyn Mawr reservoir. Following the path further will take you to Foel-Goch and then on to Y Garn . From the 947\u00a0m (3,107\u00a0ft) summit there are great views of Llyn Clyd and the Ogwen Valley. Also nearby are the climbs to Glyder Fawr and Glyder Fach and Tryfan .",
