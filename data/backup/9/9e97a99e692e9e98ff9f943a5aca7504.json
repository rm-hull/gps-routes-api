The priory, founded in 1141 by Maurice de Londres as an offshoot of Gloucester\u2019s Benedictine abbey, stands as a remarkable example of Norman Romanesque architecture in Wales. The priory's church, presbytery, and transepts are particularly noteworthy for their austere design and historical significance. In addition to its architectural heritage, Ewenny Priory is distinguished by its unusually robust defences. The impressive walls and gates that remain today hint at a significant level of fortification. The exact reason for such defences in a small and otherwise unremarkable settlement like Ewenny is uncertain. There is speculation that these fortifications might have been more for display rather than practical defensive purposes. Despite the ambiguity surrounding the purpose of its defences, Ewenny Priory has maintained a continuous and active presence in the community. The Norman nave, a testament to the priory's enduring legacy, still functions as the local parish church, underscoring its long-standing role in the region's religious and cultural life."
