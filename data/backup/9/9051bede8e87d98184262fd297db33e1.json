  "description": "This walk visits the Grade I listed Fawsley Hall in Northamptonshire. The splendid old hall dates back to the 15th century and is now a hotel where you can enjoy luxury accomodation or an afternoon tea. The grounds are very pretty with lakes, formal gardens and parkland landscaped by Capability Brown in the 1760s. There's also the noteworthy St Mary's Church which dates back to the 13th century. The Knightley Way passes through Fawsley Park so you can enjoy a walk along the public footpath with views across the park. This walk starts at the hall and follows the waymarked trail north to visit the nearby Badby Woods. The peaceful woods are a nice place to extend your walk with a number of easy trails and pretty bluebells in the spring months. To continue the walk head a couple of miles east to visit Everdon Stubbs. The small nature reserve is a nice quiet place for wildlife watching in the area.",
