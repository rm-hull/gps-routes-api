There are also very good facilties with a Nature Centre, cafe and a delightful Walled Garden with a maze and picnic area. There are many walking trails but Tilgate is popular with mountain bikers too, while National Cycle Route 20 also runs through the park. Our London to Brighton Cycle Route passes through the park and is a good way to continue your exercise. It's a popular route running along signed paths all the way to the coast.",
