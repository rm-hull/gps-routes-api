  "description": "Enjoy a walk along one of the Lake District's most beautiful lakes. Derwent Water (or Derwenwater) is particularly lovely - it's surrounded by fells and has several pretty islands including Derwent Island House, an 18th-century residence owned by the National Trust\u00a0and open to the public on five days each year. The route makes use of the Cumbria Way and the Allerdale Ramble walking trails so is well defined and way-marked throughout. The walk starts in the popular town of Keswick and follows the path along the western side of the lake. On the way down you stay close to the waters edge for most of the way. There are also some lovely woodland sections to enjoy. At the end of the lake you return north on the Allerdale Ramble with a short climb taking you along the lower part of Cat Bells fell and away from the lakeside. There are fabulous views of the lake from the high points before descending through Overside Wood and returning to Keswick.",
