The African version was a little larger than this one, though \u0096 it covered over 300 square miles! In spring the pool is covered in water lilies."

  "description": "This Surrey based town has some nice easy waterside trails along the local river and canal. This walk from the train station takes you along a section of the Blackwater Valley Footpath to the Frimley Hatches Nature Reserve and the village of Frimley Green. You'll then enjoy another waterside footpath along the Basingstoke Canal toward Pirbright . Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of water loving birds around the reserve's lakes. The walk starts at Frimley train station on the western side of the town. From here you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it south along the River Blackwater and a series of lakes. At the nature reserve turn east to visit the village of Frimley Green where there's a pretty village green, a nice pub and Wharfenden Lake. Near the lake you can pick up the canal and follow it east past a series of locks, aqueducts and weirs towards Pirbright and Woking . Near here you could extend the walk by visiting Brookwood Cemetery .",
