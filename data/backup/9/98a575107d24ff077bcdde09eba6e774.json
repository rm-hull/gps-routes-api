  "description": "Explore this attractive Herefordshire town and enjoy riverside trails along the River Lugg. The walk starts in the town centre at the noteworthy Grange Court. The timber-framed building was built in 1633 by John Abel, and moved to its present location in 1859. It is extravagantly decorated with carvings, including mermaids, angels, animals, flowers and grotesque people. The route then follows public footpaths north past Leominster Priory which dates from the 13th century. You cross the River Kenwater before picking up riverside trails on the eastern side of the River Lugg. Follow the trails south to Eaton Hall where you cross the river and follow the trails back into the town centre. You can extend your walking in the area by heading north to Berrington Hall. There's nice footpaths to follow around the 250 acres of 'Capability' Brown designed parkland here. You can follow the long distance Herefordshire Trail from the town to the hall, via Eyton and Luston. Also nearby is the heathland of Bircher Common and the interesting Iron Age Hillfort at Croft Ambrey at Croft Castle. A few miles to the south of the town you will find Queenswood Country Park. There's some nice waymarked trails here and an arboretum, with over 1,200 rare and exotic trees from all over the world. The park also includes the tranquil Bodenham Lake Nature Reserve where you can look out for various wildfowl on the water.",

      "content": "The Black and White Village Trail starts at the train station in the town. This long distance footpath explores several of the towns and villages of the county. It's named after the wonderful old timber framed buildings which are typical of the area. On the route there's some fascinating history and excellent views of the surrounding rolling countryside. Following the trail west will take you to the delightful settlement of Weobley where you can visit the Norman church and The Ley, a Grade-I listed farmhouse dating to 1589.  A few miles north west of the town you'll find the pretty village of Shobdon which is well worth a visit. The picturesque village includes the grounds of the 18th century Shobdon Court with a number of pretty pools to see. There's also the historic Bateman Arms pub which dates from 1750. You can explore the village on the Shobdon Circular Walk. For more walking ideas in the area see the Herefordshire Walks page."
