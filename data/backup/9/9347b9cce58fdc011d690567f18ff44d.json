You could leave the path near here to explore Frenchay village which includes a lovely large village common overlooked by a number of 18th-century houses built by wealthy Quaker families. Sporting buffs will be interested in the common as it used to be the home of the historic Frenchay Cricket Club. This was captained by W.G. Grace, the famous Victorian cricketer who also captained England and Gloucestershire."
