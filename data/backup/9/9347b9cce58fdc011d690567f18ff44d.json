Sporting buffs will be interested in the common as it used to be the home of the historic Frenchay Cricket Club. This was captained by W.G. Grace, the famous Victorian cricketer who also captained England and Gloucestershire."

      "content": "The route runs for about 18 miles on a path that rises steadily from Bristol to Old Sodbury. If you'd like an easier walk you could start in Old Sodbury and then gently descend into Bristol. Near the start of the walk you'll pass the noteworthy Snuff Mills near the historic village of Winterbourne. This pleasant park includes an old mill which was used for cutting and crushing stone from the sereies of quarries in the Frome Valley during the late 19th century. The area is also great for wildlife watching with otters seen in the river and various birds in the peaceful surrounding woodland. Adjacent to the mill is the Oldbury Court Estate. You could take a small detour from the path to explore the estate which includes some nice parkland trails. Just to the south of the trail you can pick up the Bristol and Bath Railway Path. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line between the two cities. When in the centre of Bristol you could pick up the River Avon Trail for more riverside walking through the area. At the other end of the route the trail links with the epic Cotswold Way National Trail. For more walking ideas see the Cotswolds Walks and Gloucestershire Walks pages."
