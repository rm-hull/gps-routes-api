  "description": "This is a fine circular walk around the beautiful Buttermere lake in the Lake District National Park. The lake has a delightful walking path running along most of the shoreline making for an idyllic waterside stroll. It's one the most popular and scenic areas of the Lake District with the lake surrounded by several fells. Look out for the High Stile range to the south west, Robinson to the north east, Fleetwith Pike and Haystacks to the south east and Grasmoor to the north west. You start off in the pretty village of Buttermere which takes its name from the lake. The village contains several Grade II listed farmhouses and barns dating from the 16th and 17th centuries. It's a short stroll south from the village centre to the lake. You then pick up the shoreline trail passing through a rock tunnel beneath Hassness on the way round. The fells of Fleetwith Pike and Haystacks make a tremendous backdrop to the walk. Back in the village you can enjoy refreshments at one of the fine pubs. The Bridge Inn is a firendly pub with a good menu and an outdoor seating section with fine views of the surrounding fells. The lake is reachable on foot from the popular town of Keswick on the Keswick to Buttermere Walk . It's about a 9 mile hike, passing Catbells and Robinson fell on the way. If you would like to extend this walk then you could head to Crummock Water which is right next to Buttermere. Loweswater is also not far and is generally a more peaceful option as there are usually fewer visitors to this area. For great views back down to the water you could try the climb to the lovely Rannerdale Knotts which overlooks Buttermere and Crummock Water. The small fell also includes the delightful bluebell valley.",
