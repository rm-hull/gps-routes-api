  "description": "The North Yorkshire town of Grassington is an excellent base for exploring the beautiful Wharfedale on foot. It is the main residential and tourist centre in Upper Wharfedale and a popular place for walkers. Centred on its small cobbled square are a number of shops, public houses, cafes, restaurants and hotels. There is also the fascinating Grassington Folk Museum which tells the story of the history of Wharfedale. This walk uses the Dales Way and other public footpaths to visit some of the highlights of the area. You'll enjoy riverside paths, waterfalls, rushing becks, historic houses, challenging climbs and wonderful limestone scenery. The walk starts in the centre of the town and follows the Dales Way to the River Wharfe where you pick up the riverside path. It heads south east to the beautiful Linton Falls where there is a great viewpoint from the bridge over the river. The route continues towards Hebden and Burnsall before turning north along the Fir Beck towards Skyreholme. Shortly after you come to the delightful Parceval Hall Gardens. This Grade II listed manor house has 24 acres of formal and woodland gardens to explore and is well worth a small detour from the route. The walk continues to another major highlight of Wharfedale at Troller's Gill. The wonderful limestone gorge includes the pretty Skyreholme Beck which flows through it. The final section of the walk climbs to Grimwith Reservoir. The large reservoir is another must see attraction of the area. It has a splendid circular trail running around the perimeter of the water with a wide variety of water loving birdlife to look out for. To continue your walking in the Grassington area you could head north west of the town to the Grass Wood Nature Reserve. The reserve has miles of woodland trails with lots of wildlife to look out for. If you follow the Dales Way north from the town you could visit the interesting limestone valley at Conistone Dib and the pretty village of Kettlewell. See full details on the Grassington to Kettlewell Walk. This is another great area for walkers with the climb to Great Whernside starting from the village. You could also try our alternative Grassington Circular Walk which visits the pretty village of Hebden before climbing into the countryside above the town.",
