  "description": "Llanidloes is nicely positioned for walking with waymarked trails eminating from the town in all directions. As such you are spoilt for choice with so much lovely scenery to explore. This circular walk makes use of the Severn Way long distance trail to explore the countryside to the west of the town. There's nice views of the River Severn and the River Dulas which also runs through the little town. Starting in the centre of town follow the waymarked path south west along Penygreen Road. You'll then cross the Severn on the Felindre Bridge and head north west past Felindre Mill. The country lane takes you along the river to Bronfelen where you turn south along a bridleway. You can then follow a nice scenic country lane past Caencoed and back into the town. There's several other good options for extending your walking in the area. You could pick up the epic Glyndwr's Way and follow it north west to visit the beautiful Llyn Clywedog . The lake is a great place for birdwatching and also includes a spectacular dam which is the tallest concrete dam in the UK. Also of interest are the peaceful woodland trails in nearby Hafren Forest and the Sarn Sabrina Walk which runs around the town.",
