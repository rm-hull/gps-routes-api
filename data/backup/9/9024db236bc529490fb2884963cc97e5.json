  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll down to Esthwaite Water from the village of Hawkshead on this easy walk in the Lake District. Esthwaite is one of the less well known lakes of the national park. It's also one of the smaller ones, covering around 280 acres (1.1 km2). Esthwaite is well known for its trout and pike fishing. Starting in the centre of the village you can follow footpaths and country lanes south and then east to the water's edge. There's a good sized car park and lots of nice cafes in Hawkshead where the route starts. The walk starts from St Michael and All Angels Church in the village and picks up a footpath heading south from there. This takes you to Roger Ground where you turn east on a country lane towards the lake. You'll pass the Waterside House B&B before coming to the lake. There's lovely views across the lake to the surrounding fells. Also look out for the resident Ospreys diving for fish on the water. To extend your walking in the area you can enjoy a climb to Latterbarrow from Hawkshead. From the summit there are great views over Esthwaite Water and Lake Windermere. On the western side of Esthwaite, there's the expansive Grizedale Forest which has miles of good cycling and walking trails. On the eastern side of the water you can enjoy a climb to Claife Heights and the pretty Moss Eccles Tarn.",
