  "description": "This walk takes you through a lovely wooded gorge to the Falls of Bruar in Perthshire. There is a good sized car park at the House of Bruar which is located just to the south of the falls (you can see this on the street view link). You soon pick up the footpath taking you along Bruar Water and through pine woodland to the falls. Along the way you will find several deep black pools, stone bridges, viewpoints and picnic spots. It's a fairly steep climb but worth the effort as the falls are clear and beautiful. There are two main falls plus a series of smaller ones to enjoy. The falls were immortalised in an 18th century poem by Robert Burns named the 'The Humble Petition of Bruar Water to the Noble Duke of Atholl'. Since then they have been a popular tourist attraction. To extend your walking in the area head to Pitlochry and enjoy a waterside walk on our Pitlochry, Killiecrankie and Loch Faskally Walk . The route takes you along rivers and lochs with leaping salmon to look out for on the way. Also in Pitlochry you can try a challenging climb to Ben Vrackie . From the mountain summit there are fantastic views over the Cairngorms.",
