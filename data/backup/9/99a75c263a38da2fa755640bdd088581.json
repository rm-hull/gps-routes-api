  "description": "This walk takes you through a lovely wooded gorge to the Falls of Bruar in Perthshire. There is a good sized car park at the House of Bruar which is located just to the south of the falls (you can see this on the street view link). You soon pick up the footpath taking you along Bruar Water and through pine woodland to the falls. Along the way you will find several deep black pools, stone bridges, viewpoints and picnic spots. It's a fairly steep climb but worth the effort as the falls are clear and beautiful. There are two main falls plus a series of smaller ones to enjoy. The falls were immortalised in an 18th century poem by Robert Burns named the 'The Humble Petition of Bruar Water to the Noble Duke of Atholl'. Since then they have been a popular tourist attraction. To extend your walking in the area head to Pitlochry and enjoy a waterside walk on our Pitlochry, Killiecrankie and Loch Faskally Walk. The route takes you along rivers and lochs with leaping salmon to look out for on the way. Also in Pitlochry you can try a challenging climb to Ben Vrackie. From the mountain summit there are fantastic views over the Cairngorms.",

      "content": "The falls and surrounding woodland make for a fine dog walk so you'll probably see other owners on your visit. It's best to keep them on leads on the falls path as there are some steep edges. Water bowls can be found at the House of Bruar car park."

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "Head a few miles south and you could visit Queen's View Loch Tummel. There's a splendid viewpoint here with views over the loch to the surrounding mountains. In the adjacent Allean Forest there's also miles of great walking trails to try. To the east of the loch there's the Linn Of Tummel, a picturesque spot at the confluence of the rivers Garry and Tummel. The National Trust owned area has some nice woodland trails with pine martens and other wildlife to look out for. Just south east of Pitlochry there's the Black Spout Waterfall to visit. It's a picturesque spot with rushing falls, woodland trails and views of the Blair Atholl and Edradour Distilleries."
