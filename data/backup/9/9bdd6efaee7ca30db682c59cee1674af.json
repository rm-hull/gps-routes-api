  "description": "Climb to the summit of Ben Vrackie on this challenging walk in Pitlochry. Start the walk from the car park just to the north of the town near Moulin. The route then heads north, skirting the edge of the woodland of the Tay Forest Park. You climb towards Craig Bhreac before coming to the lovely Loch a' Choire. The final section takes you up some steps to the 841 m (2759 feet) summit. From here there are wonderful views over the Cairngorms. You can return the same way or try an alternative path around the western side of Loch a' Choire. To continue your walking in the Pitlochry area then try our Pitlochry, Killiecrankie and Loch Faskally Walk. The route takes you along rivers and lochs with leaping salmon to look out for on the way. Also nearby are the Falls of Bruar. The lovely wooded gorge includes beautiful waterfalls, several deep black pools, stone bridges, viewpoints and picnic spots.",
