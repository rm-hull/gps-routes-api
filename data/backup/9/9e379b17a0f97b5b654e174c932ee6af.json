  "description": "This pretty Cotswolds village is located in a lovely spot close to the River Windrush and River Thames. This circular walk explores the area to the south of the village, visiting the River Thames, Shifford Lock, Standlake Common and the village of Newbridge where the two rivers meet. There's lots of nice waterside paths and fine views of the surrounding Oxfordshire countryside to enjoy on the way. The walk starts in the village and heads south west past a series of lakes towards Shifford and Chimney Meadows Nature Reserve where there's lots of water loving wildlife to see. Near here you cross the water at the Shifford Lock Cut and head south towards Duxford Ford. Here you pick up the Thames Path and follow the waymarked National Trail east towards Newbridge where the Thames and the Windrush meet. You then cross the river and follow footpaths across Standlake Common, passing several more lakes before arriving back in the village.",
