  "description": "The Lancashire village of Aughton is located just to the west of the market town of Ormskirk. This circular walk explores the Clieves Hills area located to the north of the settlement. The area has some pleasant country lanes and footpaths with fine views over the countryside of the Lancashire Plain. On a clear day you can also see the city of Liverpool and the Welsh Hills. You can start and end the walk from Aughton Park railway station on the Ormskirk branch of the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. You can catch the train to the village from Ormskirk or Liverpool Central station. To extend the walk head west to pick up the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and enjoy an easy waterside walk along the towpath.",
