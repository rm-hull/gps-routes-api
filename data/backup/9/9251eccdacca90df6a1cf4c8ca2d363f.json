On visiting Winterton-on-Sea in 1722, Daniel Defoe commented that all the houses of the village were constructed from the timbers of wrecked ships. In order to stabilise the coastline against erosion marram grass was planted and by the early 19th century dunes had built up, forming a barrier between the high water mark and the ridge on which the lighthouse stands. During the second half of the 20th century the coastline has again changed in that some of the dunes eroded. The area is mostly situated at approximately sea level and erosion and flooding are constant potential risks to the village."

The reserve is unusual in that it shows greater ecological similarities to the dune systems of the Baltic - which support acidic plant communities - rather than the dunes on the North Norfolk Coast - where the sand is calcareous. The site supports well developed areas of dune heath, wet 'slacks' between dunes and dune grassland which grades into grazing marsh and birch woodland. The sand dunes are interspersed by peaty areas, where heather and reindeer moss can be found growing in abundance."

Horsey Mere is the only broad in Norfolk surrounded by a high level bank for which reason it is called a mere, rather than a broad. The term 'mere' originates from an old Dutch word meaning an artificial lake. The mere is part of the Broads national park area, and the Horsey Estate is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Horsey Estate was purchased by the National Trust from the Buxton family in 1948. The Buxton family still manage the estate in partnership with the National Trust and it is thanks to the fact that nature conservation has always been a priority for the Buxtons that Horsey remains an important place for wildlife. In winter Horsey Mere is an internationally important wildfowl refuge and home to thousands of ducks including teal, wigeon and pochard."

The reserve consists of open shallow brackish water surrounded by reeds and sedge fens and is believed to have been created by the flooding of peat bogs prior to the 13th century. Due to its excellent water quality, the broad has one of the most diverse assemblages of aquatic plants in Broadland. The surrounding reed swamp is composed of common reed and commercial sedge beds."

  "description": "This village in Norfolk has lovely coastal walking trails, a wonderful dune based nature reserve and some gorgeous local broads and meres to visit. The village itself is also very pretty with delightful cottages, unusual roundhouses and a fine 17th century pub to visit. This circular walk from the village takes you along the beach to the nearby Horsey Windpump and Horsey Mere . You'll also visit the picturesque Martham Broad where there's a nature reserve and good birdwatching opportunities. The walk starts in the public car park on the beach at Winterton. From here you can follow footpaths heading north through the Winterton Dunes. The dunes are part of a National Nature Reserve where you can look out for a variety of coastal birds and the natterjack toad. You can follow a path through the dunes to Bramble Hill and Horsey Gap. Here you leave the coast to follow footpaths south west to Horsey Windpump and Horsey Mere. You can climb the mill and enjoy fabulous views over the mere and surrounding broads. After exploring the mere the route heads south from the mill to the Hundred Stream before coming to Martham Broad and the mill near the village of West Somerton. From here you follow footpaths east to East Somerton where you'll pass the remains of St Mary's church. Shortly after you return to Winterton on Sea where the route finishes.",
