  "description": "Hazel Grove is located in the Stockport area of Greater Manchester, close to the Peak District National Park. This walk from the town uses part of the Ladybrook Valley Interest Trail and other public footpaths to visit some of the local highlights including Poynton Lake and the Macclesfield Canal. It's a pretty area with views of the Lady Brook and lots of wildlife to see around the picturesque Poynton Lake. Near the canal you will also link up with the Middlewood Way. This popular shared cycling and walking trail runs betweens Macclesfield and Marple along the old railway line.",
