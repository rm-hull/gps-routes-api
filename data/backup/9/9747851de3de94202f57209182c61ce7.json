  "description": "This pretty village in Greater Manchester has some nice river and canalside trails to try. You're also very close to the Derbyshire Peak District countryside which can be explored to the east. This circular walk from the village takes you around Braybns Park where you can enjoy some pleasant riverside trails along the River Goyt. On the western side of the park you can then pick up a section of the Peak Forest Canal and visit the picturesque Marple Canal Locks. The walk starts and finishes from the train station in the village. You can extend the walk by heading north to pick up the Etherow Goyt Valley Way and following it east to visit Etherow Country Park. Heading west would take you towards Romiley and the historic Chadkirk Country Estate .",
