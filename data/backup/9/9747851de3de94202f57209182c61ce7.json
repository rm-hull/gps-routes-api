  "description": "This pretty village in Greater Manchester has some nice river and canalside trails to try. You're also very close to the Derbyshire Peak District countryside which can be explored to the east. This circular walk from the village takes you around Braybns Park where you can enjoy some pleasant riverside trails along the River Goyt. On the western side of the park you can then pick up a section of the Peak Forest Canal and visit the picturesque Marple Canal Locks. The walk starts and finishes from the train station in the village. You can extend the walk by heading north to pick up the Etherow Goyt Valley Way and following it east to visit Etherow Country Park. Heading west would take you towards Romiley and the historic Chadkirk Country Estate .",

      "content": "The Cown Edge Way can be picked up just to the east of the village. If you follow it east it will take you into the Peak District where you can enjoy some hill climbs and splendid views. Just to the south east there's the climb to the Mellor Cross. The religous cross marks the site where John Wesley preached during the 18th century. There are fine views from the elevated position of the site. Just to the east is the pretty little hamlet of Rowarth. Here you will find the Little Mill Inn, a delightful Grade II listed inn set in a former candlewick mill, with a waterwheel in the adjacent stream. The historic mill is well known locally and includes an outdoor area with ducks and geese on the river, chickens roaming free and rabbits in a large outdoor pen. Our walk from the village climbs to the geologically fascinating Cown Edge Rocks and Robin Hood's Picking Rods."
