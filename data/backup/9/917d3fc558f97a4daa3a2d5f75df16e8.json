  "description": "This is a lovely walk taking you from the popular town of Ambleside to Skelwith Bridge via Loughrigg Tarn. It's a fairly easy route, running for just under 4 miles with some moderate climbs. Starting in Ambleside head west through Rothay Park before climbing to Miller Brow and Deer Hows. There's great views back down to Ambleside and Windermere Lake from the high points around here. The route then descends to Ivy Crag before another short climb up to Loughrigg Tarn. It's a delightfully peaceful spot with the tranquil waters of the tarn surrounded by some beautiful countryside. After rounding the tarn you descend to Neaum Crag and then to Skelwith Bridge where you can visit Skelwith Force waterfall. The impressive falls are located on the River Brathay and include a viewing area where you can get close up to the rushing water. Near here there's a nice riverside cafe where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. Across the road there's also the Skelwith Bridge Hotel. From here you can pick up the bus back to Ambleside. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Cumbria Way and head west to visit Colwith Force waterfall. The falls drop 40 feet over several stages and are a spectacular sight when in full spate.",
