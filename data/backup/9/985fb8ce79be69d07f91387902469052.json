  "description": "Explore the stunning gardens and woodlands surrounding this Italianate mansion near Maidenhead. The grounds include several beautifully laid out gardens. The Rose Garden with red, orange and yellow flowers, the oriental water garden with Chinese pagoda and the Long Garden with stunning floral displays and topiary. There are also miles of woodland paths with stunning views back to the gardens and over the surrounding Berkshire countryside. Look out for elephant, bear and tiger wood carvings as you go. The grounds also extend down to the River Thames so there is the opportunity for some waterside walking too. Other highlights include the recently restored maze, a number of exquisite temples, pavilions and follies, and the Fountain of Love located the end of the lime tree avenue which runs up to the house. The house itself is now a luxury hotel but tours are available for the general public. The house has been home to an earl, three countesses, two dukes, a Prince of Wales and the Viscounts Astor. During the 1960s, it became the setting for key events of the notorious Profumo Affair. The Thames Path and the Shakespeare's Way walking routes run past Cliveden. Both of these are good options if you would like to continue your walk. You could also head west to Bisham Woods where there are miles of good walking trails and mountain bike tracks to try. The Beeches Way runs past the northern edge of Cliveden. If you pick this up and head east you will soon come to the splendid Burnham Beeches Nature Reserve. The popular site covers over 500 acres with a network of woodland trails. There's also ponds, grassland, heathland with wildlife including Exmoor Ponies.",

Some areas are also off lead too with the National Trust providing a map at the information point."

      "content": "The house is strongly associated with the Profumo Affair of the 1960s. Conservative politician John Profumo and Christine Keeler met at the house in 1961. They subsequently started an affair which was to force his resignation, severley damage the government of the time, and create a lasting impact on the future course of British politics. Just to the north there's the neighbouring village of Wooburn Green. There's a pleasant large green here with a number of historic properties including a 16th century public house. There's also a pretty local park with walks along the River Wye and peaceful adjacent woodland. You can pick up the Beeches Way just to the north of the house and follow it towards the worthy settlement."
