  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Constantine Bay to Harlyn Bay on the Cornish coast. The walk starts from the car park at Constantine Bay where you'll find a popular surfing beach. From here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it north to Trevose Head . At the northern tip of the headland there's the Trevose lighthouse and some splendid views to enjoy. The route then heads south along Polventon Bay to Harlyn Bay where there's another lovely beach. Here you can turn west to follow inland paths to Constantine Bay village where there are the remains of the ancient St Constantine's Church. From the village it is a short stroll back to the car park where the route finishes. You can extend your walking in the area by heading to nearby Padstow on the Padstow to Harlyn Bay Walk .",
