  "description": "Climb to the 1,130 m (3,710 ft) summit of this famous Munro in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The peaks of Ben Lui are designated as a National Nature Reserve with lush mountain vegitation including saxifrages, mosses and lichens. This walk starts from the car park in Glen Lochy just off the A85 and crosses the River Lochy before a pleasant woodland section along a burn. After leaving the woodland you continue the climb past Fionn Choire to the summit where you can enjoy wonderful views of the surrounding peaks. You can extend your walk by heading to Beinn a' Chleibh which lies about 1.5 miles to the south west.",
