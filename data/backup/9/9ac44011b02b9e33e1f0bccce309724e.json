  "description": "Explore the woodland, gardens, parkland and riverside in this beautiful country park in Gwynedd. The park and gardens are Grade One listed and home to some of the rarest flora and fauna in the Wales. Glynllifon contains many lovely walking trails including one through woodland and along the River Llifon with follies and sculptures along the way. There is also a cafe and a maze and exhibits such as steam power pistons restored by Fred Dibnah. The park sits next to the Lon Eifion Cycle/Walk Route which runs along a disused railway line. If you'd like to extend your walking in the area then this is a good option. The surfaced path has great views of the Welsh Highland Railway and Snowdonia National Park.",
