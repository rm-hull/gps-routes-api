In what way they might be related is a matter of conjecture, but such a vast array of monuments indicates that the site was of great spiritual importance to the people who lived in the area."

The quarry closed in December 1997 and much of the cutting machinery remained in the decaying sheds in this picture until contractors removed all the scrap metal, including the crane in late 2007. The deep flooded pit and huge spoil tip dominate the landscape here now."

  "description": "This walk visits the Merrivale Prehistoric Settlement on Dartmoor. The area is a fine place for a walk with a fascinating Bronze Age settlement surrounded by some lovely Dartmoor scenery. The ancient area includes a complex of ritual sites, three stone rows, a stone circle, standing stones and a number of cairns. There is a car park just east of the photogenic Merrivale Bridge where you can start your walk. Trails will then take you around the site with great views over Dartmoor to enjoy on the way. You can extend the walk by climbing to Great Staple Tor and Roos Tor for some wonderful views over the area. The climb to Great Mis Tor also starts from the eastern Merrivale car park.",
