  "description": "This circular walk takes you through the beautiful Padley Gorge, part of the wider Longshaw Estate in the White Peak area of the Peak District National Park. The route runs for a distance of just over 3 miles and includes some moderate climbs. You'll reach a height of over 1000ft from the high points with great views to enjoy over the Peak District hills and a series of photogenic waterfalls. The walk starts from Grindleford Station but you could just as easily start from the car park at the Longshaw Estate visitor centre which is also on the route. From the station you can pick up the Padley Gorge Trail and follow it along the pretty Burbage Brook which runs through the wooded gorge. At Burbage Bridge you turn south east, passing the Fox House Inn and the Longshaw Estate visitor centre. The centre is housed in the Shooting Lodge and includes nice tea rooms where you could stop for refreshments. The final section runs through Granby Wood and the oak woodland of Yarncliff Wood before returning to the station. Our Froggatt Edge Circular Walk passes very close to Grindleford so it's easy to extend the walk if you have time. The elevated route includes great views, interesting rock formations, sheltered birch woodland and lots of lovely heather to see in the late summer.",

They have a decent bar menu and a beautiful terraced garden over-looking the Derwent river valley. If the weather is fine it's a great place to enjoy a drink and a bite to eat. You can find it in the village on Sir William Hill Road with a postcode of S32 2HS for your sat navs."
