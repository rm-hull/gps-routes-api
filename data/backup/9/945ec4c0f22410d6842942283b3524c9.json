  "description": "This circular walk explores the lovely countryside surrounding the Suffolk village of Lavenham. The route runs for about 5 miles, exploring the countryside to the east of Lavenham before visiting the nearby village of Brent Eleigh. It's a fairly flat route with a couple of short climbs, so suitable for most abilities. Start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the village and follow the footpath north east. You'll pass some of the wonderful half-timbered medieval cottages that the village is famous for. The route then picks up the Clay Lane track to head east past Clay Hill to Spragg's Wood. You then turn south along Hall Lane, leading you into Brent Eleigh. The village has a noteworthy church which dates from the 13th-century and includes a number of 14th century paintings. It's also a good place to stop for refreshments at what is roughly the half way point of the walk. The Cock Inn does a good selection of meals and has a nice outdoor seating area as well. The route leaves the village, heading south east along Cock Lane. A public footpath then leads west to Bear's Lane Farm where you pick up a country lane to take you back into Lavenham. To continue your walking in the village, try our Lavenham Railway and Woods Walk. The route uses a section of the St Edmund Way long distance trail to take you through the village and then into the countryside along a disused railway line.",

The route uses a section of the St Edmund Way long distance trail to take you through the village and then into the countryside along a disused railway line. A few miles south east of the village you'll find the delightful village of Kersey. It's one of the prettiest places in the county with medieval cottages, the famous Water Splash and a fine old timber framed pub. The circular Kersey Walk explores the countryside around the village and visits the little village of Lindsey on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Suffolk Walks page."
