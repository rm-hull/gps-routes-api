  "description": "Climb to Helvellyn from Thirlmere Lake on this challenging climb. Helvellyn is the third highest mountain in England at 950m (3,120\u00a0ft) and one of the most popular climbs in the country. It is situated in the Lake District National Park between Thirlmere Reservoir and Ullswater. This route starts at the parking lot at Thirlmere Reservoir and takes a direct, short route to the summit via Helvellyn Gill and Browncove Crags. It's a steep ascent but the path is well defined for most of the route so there isn't much scrambling. The views from the summit are spectacular. On a clear day you can see the Solway Firth\u00a0and hills of south-west Scotland to the north-west,\u00a0Cheviot\u00a0and the\u00a0Pennine Hills\u00a0to the north-east,\u00a0Morecambe Bay, Blackpool and the coast of North Wales to the south, and the Irish Sea to the west. Thrill seekers can take an alternative route from Glenridding via Striding Edge - an exposed knife edge ridge\u00a0which is not for the faint hearted. See the video bellow for details. If you would like an alternative route up to the summit you can ascend from Glenridding. This requires a challenging scramble along Swirral Edge or Striding Edge and requires a head for heights. The Red Tarn Walk shows most of this route.",
