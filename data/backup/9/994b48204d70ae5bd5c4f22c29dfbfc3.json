It sits between Higher Market street on the right and Lower Market Street on the left. The street plan of this area has not changed since this was a medieval market place with the houses and shops at the front of narrow medieval burgage strips. This is still the commercial core of Penryn but it is obviously no longer a major shopping centre as it has been since medieval times. There is distinct lack of the normal high street shops."

  "description": "This Cornish based town has some lovely river and coastal walks to try. It's an attractive and historic town with several buildings dating from Tudor, Jacobean and Georgian times. As such the town is an important conservation area with the centrepiece the Town Hall Clock which dates from 1839. This walk from the town takes you along the Penyrn River to nearby Flushing. The walk starts in the town centre and follows a footpath along the harbour towards Gorrangorra. You continue east along the river towards Trevissome House before finishing on the Quays at Flushing. There's some nice views over the river to Falmouth on the opposite side here. You can also catch the Flushing Ferry over the river to visit the bustling port.",

It's positioned right next to the river so you can sit outside and enjoy a meal while admiring the boats in the harbour. It takes it's name from the beach directly outside where you can look out for a variety of wading birds. You can find them at Jubilee Wharf, with a postcode of TR10 8FG for your sat navs."

There's a nice circular trail around the lake with lovely countryside views over the water and a noteworthy ancient church on the western side. Just to the north east there's the worthy village of Mylor Bridge where you can enjoy some lovely waterside walks along the Mylor Creek and Restronguet Creek, on the beautiful Fal Estuary. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
