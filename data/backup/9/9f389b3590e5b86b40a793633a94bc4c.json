  "description": "A popular riverside walk between these two attractive Yorkshire towns. The route uses a section of the Harrogate Ringway to take you along the River Nidd and through the Nidd Gorge . On the way you will pass the Nidd Viaduct, old mills and rushing weirs. Look out for a variety wildlife such as tawny owl, roe deer, woodpeckers and herons on the water. The route starts in Harrogate town centre and heads north to pick up the Harrogate Ringway waymarked trail. You continue north towards Knox where you turn east through Bilton to the Nidd Viaduct. You then enter the Nidd Gorge where the river enters a deep ravine with sheer, tree covered valley sides. The gorge makes up approximately 3 miles of the entire length of the river and stretches from the Nidd Viaduct to Grimbald Bridge, just south of\u00a0Knaresborough. At the end of the walk you can catch the train directly back to Harrogate or you could continue along the Harrogate Ringway. In Knaresborough you can pick up the Knaresborough Round to continue your walking in the area. The 20 mile circular walk takes you on a tour of the countryside, lakes, rivers, woodland and villages surrounding the historic Yorkshire town.",
