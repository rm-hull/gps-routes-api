Remains of Castle Acre Priory, which is one of the largest and best preserved monastic sites in England, the foundation of Castle Acre Priory in about 1090 sprang directly from a visit by William de Warenne II and his wife Gundrada to the great French monastery of Cluny. So impressed were they by its beauty and holiness that they vowed to introduce the Cluniac order of monks to England. Through the opening you can see St James's Church in the village."

  "description": "This lovely circular walk takes you around the grounds of Castle Acre Priory, before heading along the River Nar to the nearby Castle Acre Common. You can then explore the wider countryside surrounding the village on various footpaths and bridleways. The walk starts at the castle in the centre of this pretty Norfolk village. The remains of the motte-and-bailey castle are well worth exploring before you head off towards the priory. It dates from the 11th century and is in the care of English Heritage. From the castle you head west through the village to the priory. The fascinating and atmospheric ruins date back to the late 11th century. There are substantial remains of many of the buildings round the cloister, a beautiful west end church gable and a herb garden. After exploring the priory you continue west along the Nar Valley Way to West Acre where you can stop for refreshments at the Stag pub. You can then follow other trails through the countryside to Bartholomew's Hills before returning to the village along the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path. If you would like to extend your walk then you can continue along the River Nar to Narford Lake and Narborough, a few miles west of West Acre. Following the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path south will take you towards Swaffham where you'll find some fine Georgian buildings and an interesting medieval church. Head north and you will come to the pretty neighbouring village of Great Massingham. Near here you can pay a visit to the historic Houghton Hall and gardens. You can virtually explore the grounds of the priory on the google street view link below!",

      "content": "For more interesting local history in the area head to Castle Rising near King's Lynn. Here you'll find the ruins of an English Heritage owned castle surrounded by impressive earthworks. The pretty little village of the same name is also well worth exploring. Just to the north of the village you'll also find Sandringham Country Park. The expansive park surrounds the Queen's famous country retreat. In the park you'll find miles of excellent woodland and parkland walking trails. On the western side of the estate there's also the interesting village of Wolferton. Here you can visit the noteworthy Wolferton Railway Station. The now disused station was well known during the 1800\u2019s through its association with the Royal Family who used the station because of its proximity to Sandringham House. There are also trails to pick up around the Dersingham Bog Nature Reserve in this area. The reserve is part of the wider Sandringham Royal Estate and includes attractive heathland with interesting flora and fauna to see.Bawsey Country Park is also located nearby and has some lovely parkland and lakes with excellent wildlife spotting opportunites. Just north of the park you'll find purple heather and Dartmoor ponies on Roydon Common. Follow the Nar Valley Way west and you will soon come to Shouldham Warren where there are two colour coded waymarked walks. The nature reserve includes beautiful pine woodlands and a fine Rhododendron Avenue. The associated village is also worth seeing with a pretty village green and a 14th century church to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Walks page."
