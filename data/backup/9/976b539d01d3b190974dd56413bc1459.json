The setting includes an ancient manor house that inspired the fictional home of Lady Chatterley. This connection with literature adds to the village's historical and cultural significance. Teversal is designated a conservation area due to the importance of its architectural and historical heritage. Many of its buildings are listed, built from local stone and traditional roofing materials, preserving the village's charm. Nearby Silverhill Woods, once a colliery spoil heap, is now transformed into a natural space, boasting the title of Nottinghamshire's highest point. A striking statue of a miner, holding a Davey lamp, stands at the summit, offering panoramic views across five counties on clear days. This monument serves as a tribute to the region\u2019s mining heritage and its transformation into a green space for locals and visitors alike. The village also includes a Grade one listed mediaeval church with some wonderful architectural and ecclesiastical features."

  "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking along these former railway lines, located on the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire border. It's a nice flat path, with good views of the surrounding countryside to enjoy on the way. The circular route starts from the Teversal Trails visitor centre on Carnarvon Street in the Ashfield district of Nottinghamshire. The centre has lots of information on the walks and cycle routes in the area. There's plenty of parking and a nice cafe for refreshments at the end of your exercise. From the centre you head north along the old railway toward Upper Pleasley where you will find Pleasley Pit Country Park in Derbyshire. The former colliery site has been converted into a lovely country park and local nature reserve with ponds, reed beds, grassland and woodland. At the park the route turns south towards the village Skegby where there are a number of interesting old buildings to see. Just before reaching the village you turn west, passing Coppy Wood before returning to the visitor centre. The trail passes very close to Hardwick Hall which is well worth a visit. Here you can enjoy 2,500 acres of parkland, woodland, wetland and farmland on series of good trails. Near the start of the route you will brush the eastern edge of Silverhill Wood. The country park has some good woodland cycling and walking trails and also includes the highest point in Nottinghamshire.",
