  "description": "A circular walk around the Oxfordshire village of Shrivenham, visiting the Wilts and Berks Canal and a local nature reserve. The walk starts in the village and heads south to visit the Wilts & Berks Canal. This section of the old canal has recently been restored by volunteers. Follow the towpath east towards Stainswick Lane before turning north to pass the nature reserve. The route then heads along the High Street in the village where you can see a number of pretty thatched cottages and the old stocks.",
