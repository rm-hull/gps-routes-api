  "description": "The Kirkstone pass is located a few miles north of Ambleside at an altitude of 1,489 feet. This makes it the Lake District\u2019s highest pass that is open to motor traffic. It is named after a large standing stone 500 metres from the inn on the road to Ullswater. This walk from the Kirkstone Pass Inn takes you up to the nearby Red Screes summit. It's only just over half a mile away but is a fairly steep climb. Start the walk from the parking area at the remote inn. The pub is in an unusual elevated position making it the third-highest public house in England. From the inn you cross the road and pick up a trail heading north west up to the Kilnshaw Chimney and the red Screes summit. From here there are excellent views over the surrounding fells, down to Windemere Lake and across to the coast. There's also a pretty tarn at the summit. After taking in the views you descend back to the pub on the same paths.",
