  "description": "This circular walk visits the mysterious King Arthur's Cave in the Wye Valley AONB near Symonds Yat. It's a lovely walk with long riverside sections and peaceful woodland trails. The area around the cave is also very quiet with just the sound of the river and birds to enjoy. Start the walk from the Hollow Rock car park in Symonds Yat East. From here you can pick up footpath taking you up to the river. Here you can follow the waymarked Wye Valley Walk south along the river to Lady Park Wood. A footbridge takes you over to the north side of the river here before trails through Lords Wood lead you to King Arthur's Cave. The cave entrance lies less than 100 metres above the river on a hill, with a double interconnected entrance and two main chambers. It's also a designated nature reserve under the protection of the Herefordshire Nature Trust. There is evidence that the cave was occupied by man during the Upper Palaeolithic era, and flint tools and woolly mammoth bones have been unearthed within and around the caves. After exploring the cave the walk heads north east through the woods and quarry to Symonds Yat West. Here you can catch the old rope ferry over the river and follow the path back to the car park. To continue your walking in the area try the wonderful climb up to Symonds Yat Rock where there are fabulous wide ranging views over the Wye Valley.",
