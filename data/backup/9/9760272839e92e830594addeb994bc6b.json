  "description": "A waterside walk along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal from Appley Bridge to Burscough in Lancashire. There are train stations at either end of the walk so you can do it in either direction and then get the train back. It's a lovely section of canal, running for about 6 miles, passing through Parbold and Newburgh, before arriving in Burscough. About half way between Appley bridge and Parbold you can take a detour and visit Parbold Fairy Glen. It's a splendid spot with pretty streams, beautiful waterfalls, dramatic cliff faces, wooden bridges and shady woodland trails. At Burscough you can turn north and follow the Rufford Branch of the Leeds Liverpool Canal to the National Trust owned Rufford Old Hall on our Burscough Canal Walk. There'salso the option of heading east on the Wigan Canal Walk to visit Wigan Flashes Nature Reserve where there's an abundance of water loving wildlife to see.",
