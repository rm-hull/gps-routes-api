Being a chalk spring, it can run dry in periods of drought, in which case the pond level sinks, and can even dry up altogether, revealing the usual rubbish that such a site seems to attract."

  "description": "Follow the Cray Riverway on this easy waterside walk through Bromley. The walk starts off in Orpington at the attractive priory gardens where you'll find the source of the River Cray. You then head north through Sidcup, Bexley and Crayford where you join the River Darent. The Darent then leads you to the final stretch alongside the River Thames, finishing near Erith. At the northern end of the route the trail meets with the Darent Valley Path. The trail runs south along the river towards Darenth Country Park and Sevenoaks, passing through the Kent Downs AONB .",
