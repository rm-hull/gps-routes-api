Benmore Botanic Garden, located near Dunoon on Scotland\u2019s west coast, is a stunning destination for nature enthusiasts, offering visitors over 120 acres of vibrant, diverse plant collections from around the world. The garden, managed by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, is renowned for its impressive landscape, blending mountainous terrain with rare and exotic plant species. One of its highlights is the awe-inspiring avenue of towering giant redwoods, planted in 1863, creating a cathedral-like experience under their vast canopies. Beyond the redwoods, visitors can explore an extensive collection of rhododendrons, which fill the garden with colour and fragrance, especially in spring and early summer. In autumn, trees like the Japanese Katsura display vibrant hues and release a sweet, candyfloss-like scent. The Benmore Fernery is another unique feature, showcasing ferns in a semi-subterranean Victorian glass structure that attracts both casual visitors and fern enthusiasts. There are also structures such as the Bhutanese and Chilean pavilions, adding a cultural layer to the botanical displays by reflecting the origins of many plants found here.\nFor those looking for a scenic hike, the ascent through the garden leads to a viewpoint that overlooks Holy Loch, providing spectacular views of the surrounding landscape. Wildlife, including red squirrels and, occasionally, golden eagles, add to the charm of this garden, making it a peaceful sanctuary for plant lovers and outdoor adventurers alike"
