Enjoy the fragrant roses, peonies, violas, and lupins in spring and summer. Walk along the south terrace for stunning views of the Montrose Basin and beyond. Lady Augusta added the stone steps, pillars, yew hedges, and parterre, while the urns on the pillars are modern. Admire the espaliers of pears and Scottish apple varieties on the walls. The 1723 sundial on the lawn is older than the house. Don't miss the towering wellingtonias planted over 160 years ago, among the first in the UK."

  "description": "Enjoy a stroll around the beautiful grounds of this historic estate in Angus. The fine Georgian house is surrounded by some stunning gardens and woodland where you can look out for red squirrels and other wildlife. Walking highlights include Lady Augusta\u2019s Walk, which traverses the Den of Dun, a narrow gorge situated in the western section of the estate. Along the way, visitors will encounter cascading waterfalls amidst well-established woodland adorned with rhododendrons and azaleas, creating a vibrant spectacle during the spring season. Upon reaching the west walled garden, remnants of the original Dun Castle and the family mausoleum await exploration. Dating back to the 14th century, the castle succumbed to destruction during the 17th-century Civil War. Subsequently, this area transitioned into a thriving kitchen garden supporting the main residence. Look out for wildlife sightings \u2013 roe deer, otters, and red squirrels occasionally grace the surroundings, alongside woodland birds such as treecreepers, woodpeckers, and yellowhammers. Continuing the woodland trek beneath the road bridge leads to Fordhouse Barrow, an ancient burial mound, before circling back to the residence. This site, during the Neolithic era circa 4000BC, served as a religious site. Inhabitants constructed a lengthy barrow \u2013 a substantial rectangular mound formed with wooden posts and earth \u2013 where they interred their deceased within the mound or perhaps laid them atop it. You can continue your walking around the Montrose Basin where there is a nature reserve with a huge variety of wildlife.",
