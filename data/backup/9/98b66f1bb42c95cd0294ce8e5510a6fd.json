  "description": "Enjoy a woodland walk through this beautiful Arboretum near Tetbury in the Cotswolds. Here you will find 15,000 specimens from all over the world in an area covering about 600 acres. It is considered one of the most valued and significant collections of trees in the whole of the United Kingdom. In autumn it is a simply stunning spectacle providing one of the best natural fireworks displays in Britain. In spring you can see rhododendrons, azaleas and magnolias in the Old Arboretum and wildflowers, bluebells and cherry trees in Silk Wood. The area is criss crossed with numerous well surfaced walking trails. The Macmillan Way and the Monarch's Way long distance trails also run past the site so you can easily pick up a trail to extend your walk. The pretty town of Malmesbury is also nearby. There's nice riverside walks along the River Avon and the fascinating Malmesbury Abbey to visit here.",
