  "description": "This Wiltshire based village is a great place to visit with excellent walking opportunities in the surrounding area. There's canalside paths and the countryside of Pewsey Downs Nature Reserve and the Vale of Pewsey to explore. You can also easily access the village by train, direct from London Paddington station. This circular walk from the village takes you along a section of the Kennet and Avon Canal before exploring the countryside of the Vale of Pewsey to the north of the village. The walk starts at Pewsey Wharf on the canal, just to the north of the village centre and train station. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it west to Stowell Park, Lower Bristow and Wilcot before coming to Honeystreet where you leave the canal. Head north to Alton Barnes and Walkers Hill. This section takes you past the Pewsey Downs and the Alton Barnes White Horse . The area is designated as a National Nature Reserve and covers three hills and the Alton Barnes chalk white horse cut into the hillside. There's splendid views here stretching across the Vale to Salisbury Plain and the MOD's Imber Range . Near Walkers Hill and Knap Hill you pick up the  where you pick up the Tan Hill Way and follow it east to Draycott Hill, Gopher Wood, Huish Hill, Oare Hill and Martinsell Hill. It's a lovely section with fine views from the elevated position of the trail. Just after passing Martinsell Hill you pick up a country lane and follow it south east to the village of Wootton Rivers where you can pick up the canal again. Follow the towpath west and it will take you back to Pewsey Wharf, passing Carrel Crown Bridge and Milkhouse Water on the way.",
