  "description": "This Cheshire based village is crossed by two signficant long distance trails. There's also some fine local hill climbs to historic sites and miles of woodland trails in the surrounded forested areas. This figure of eight loop walk visits some of the walking highlights of the area from the village. On the route you'll pass Peckforton Castle and Peckforton Hills, Beeston Castle, Bickerton Hill and Maiden Castle. The walk starts in the village and uses sections of the Eddisbury Way and Sandstone Trail to visit Peckforton Castle and Beeston Castle to the north east. Peckforton Castle is a Victorian country house built in the style of a medieval castle during the 19th century. It is now operated as a hotel. Beeston Castle dates from the 13th century and is one of the most popular viewpoints in the region. You then head south along the Sandstone Trail through the Peckforton Hills to Bulkeley Hill, Bickerton Hill and Maiden Castle. The Iron Age hill fort dates from 600 BC and commands a fine view over the Cheshire Plain You then head past Brown Knowl and Harthill to return to the village.",
