  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the Rhossili headland on the beautiful Gower Peninsula. The walk start from the car park in the village of Rhossili. Here there is a National Trust shop in one of the former coastguard cottages. You then follow a good surfaced footpath along the headland with wonderful views of the beautiful Rhossili Bay and beach. You continue towards Kitchen Corner where there are splendid views of Worm's Head. This unusual promontory, is shaped like a giant sea-serpent and marks the most westerly tip of Gower. It is possible to walk to Worm's Head  but only when the tide is out so check tide times before if you intend to extend your walk here. The route continues along the coast to Tears Point with views of the lovely Fall Bay. The final section takes you through the countryside back to the car park. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb to the high point of the Gower at Rhossili Down on our Rhossili Bay Walk. The Gower Way long distance walk starts in Rhossili so you could follow the trail inland and visit the wonderful Cefn Bryn, an elevated sandstone ridge known as the 'backbone of Gower'. You could also pick up the Wales Coast Path and follow it north along Rhossili Bay to Llangennith. Using the google street view link below you can virtually explore area!",
