  "description": "This nice waterside walk visits Devonport Leat on Dartmoor. The route runs from near Burrator Reservoir to the aqueduct over the River Meavy just to the north. The leat was constructed in the 1790s to carry fresh drinking water from the high ground of\u00a0Dartmoor\u00a0to the expanding dockyards at Plymouth Dock. You can can now follow nice footpaths along the water in the Princetown area of Dartmoor. Start the walk from the car park at Lowery Cross, just to the west of the reservoir. From here you head north east along the leat, passing through the woodland just north of Burrator. Eventually you will come to the River Meavy Aqueduct on Walkhampton Common. This walk returns on the same paths but you could extend your outing by following the path along the eastern side of Burrator Reservoir . Here you can also enjoy a climb up to Sheepstor and Gutter Tor for fine views over the area. You can visit the other end of the leat around Wistman's Wood where it begins. There's a footpaths running along the least just to the west of the wood. You can follow it up to Beardown Tors to create a circular walk starting from the car park at Two Bridges .",
