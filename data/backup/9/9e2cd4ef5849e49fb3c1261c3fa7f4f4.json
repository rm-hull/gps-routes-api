  "description": "This Suffolk based town has some nice local trails along the Stour Brook and the\u00a0River Stour which run through the area. This walk takes you along a disused railway line which runs through the town. It is designated as a local nature reserve and includes a nice flat footpath with lots of flora and fauna to look out for. Start the walk from the East Town Park on Coupals Road at postcode CB9 7UR for your sat navs. It's a pretty park with river views, flower beds and picnic tables. The railway path also passes through it so you can pick it up and follow it north west through the town. It runs along a nice surfaced path so it's suitable for most abilities. After exploring the railway path you can enjoy a stroll around the town where there are some interesting old buildings including Anne of Cleves House which was built in 1540 by Henry VIII.",
