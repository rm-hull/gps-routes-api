  "description": "This walk in the Essex city of Chelmsford takes you along the River Can and River Chelmer to Sandford Mill. The walk starts in Central Park where there is the impressive 18-arch Victorian railway viaduct spanning the River Can. It's a lovely place to start the walk with a pretty lake, bell meadow and the Marconi Ponds local nature reserve. After strolling through the park you pick up the riverside footpaths along the Can, heading east and passing the Essex County Cricket Ground on the other side of the river. You continue east with the option of taking a detour north along the River Chelmer to the Chelmer Valley Nature Reserve. It's only a mile to the north and runs for approximately 2.5km from Valley Bridge to Victoria Road. This route continues east along the Chelmer, passing pretty meadows on your way to Sandford Mill. Here you could pick up the Centenary Circle and Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation Canal long distance trails and further explore the area around the city. The canal will take you along the easy towpath to the delightful Paper Mill Lock and the attractive town of Maldon on the Blackwater Estuary.",
