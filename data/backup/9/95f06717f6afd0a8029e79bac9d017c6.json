The internal gothick arch which divides the larger outer chamber from the dark inner one reflects that in the footbridge at the southern end of the walk down to the grotto. This too, along with Tower House, were also built by Dr Sharpe. The two niches above the grotto entrance used to house statues of Adam and Eve. The tunnel is 15m long, roofed with large slabs (over which the path runs) but is now a crawl. It is said to have allowed discrete access for bathers from the cave to the river."

The north face of the house is built in an 18th-century Gothic style whilst the south face, with its stairs up the outside, resembles a large Northumbrian bastle house."

Marks perhaps carved into the doorpost by the Knights Templar, who may have used the church in the 13th Century, are still visible."

  "description": "Explore these pretty little woods in the village of Hartburn on this short walk in Northumberland. A river runs through the area with a deep pool reputed to have been used to hide silver and valuables during Viking Raids. Look out for wildlife including red squirrels, badgers and otters and various interesting plants and flowers. There's also a splendid Grade ll listed grotto near the river. It was  created in the 18th century as a changing area for ladies wishing to bathe in the Hart Burn. Hartburn Glebe is situated about 6 miles (10 km) to the west of Morpeth. To continue your walking in the area you could visit Wallington Hall. There's some lovely walks here in the grounds of a country house with lakes, woodland, parkland and a beautiful walled garden.",
