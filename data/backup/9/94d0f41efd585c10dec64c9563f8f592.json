  "description": "This walk climbs to the Iron Age Hill Fort on the top of Foel Drygarn in the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire. You can start the walk from the public car park which lies just to the south east of the hill. From here you can pick up a trail heading north west to the hill summit which stands at a height of 363 metres. Here you will find a trig point, rocky outcrops and some splendid views over the surrounding hills to the coast at Dinas Head. There's also the three ancient stone cairns, regarded as Bronze Age burial mounds. To continue your walking in the area you could head west along the Preseli Hills Golden Road and visit the nearby peaks of Foel Cwmcerwyn and Foel Eryr .",
