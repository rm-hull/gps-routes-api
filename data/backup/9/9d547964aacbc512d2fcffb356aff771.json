  "description": "This 37 mile (60km) circular walk was created to celebrate the Queen's Jubilee in 2012. The 60km length is significant as each km represents each year of the Queen's 60 year reign. The route visits several of the capital's finest parks and includes waterside walks along the Regent's Canal and the Thames Path . The walk is well marked with a distinctive set of pavement slabs. As a circular walk you could start and finish from any location along the route. This version appropriately starts at Buckingham Palace. You then head west passing through the splendid Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens . The park includes the Serpentine Lake, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, Italian garden, statues, fountains and the Round Pond. From Kensington Gardens, you turn north passing Bayswater and Paddington before picking up the Regent's Canal which you follow east to Regent's Park . It's a beautiful park with a boating lake and the famous zoo. After leaving the park you continue along the canal through Camden Town , King's Cross and Tower Hamlets where you will pass through the lovely Victoria Park. The park is a highlight of the walk and was voted London's best local park by Time Out magazine in 2008. The route continues east through West Ham and East Ham before meeting the River Thames. You will pass the famous Royal Victoria Dock and Royal Albert Dock before crossing the river and picking up the Thames Path . You then turn west towards Greenwich where you will pass Greenwich Park and the Cutty Sark. From Greenwich you continue along the riverside path through Bermondsey before passing London Bridge, Tower Bridge , the Royal National Theatre and the London Eye. The final section takes you across Lambeth Bridge, past the Houses of Parliament and then through the splendid St James's Park . Look out for the resident pelicans in the park before finishing back at the palace. Although this is classified as a walk much of this route can be cycled, in particular the section along the Regent's Canal.",
