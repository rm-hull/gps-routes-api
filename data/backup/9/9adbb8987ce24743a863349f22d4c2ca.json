  "description": "This North Yorkshire Dales village is located in beautiful Wensleydale near Castle Bolton and Leyburn. This walk from the village takes you south to visit the Redmire Force Waterfall on the River Ure in beautiful Wensleydale. You start off in the village and follow footpaths and country lanes to Lower Thoresby and Slapestone Wath. Here you can cross the river on a series of stepping stones before turning east to visit the waterfall. It's a very photogonic spot and particularly impressive after rainfall. To extend the walk head north west from the village to visit Bolton Castle. The historic 14th century castle includes lovely gardens, a maze and excellent views from the top.",
