  "description": "This popular coastal walk takes you along the cliff top path in Ballydavid on the Dingle Peninsula of County Kerry. The walk runs for about 5km heading north along a section of the Dingle Way , a circular waymarked footpath running through the area. You can start off at the car park in Ballydavid and then follow the trail along the fairly flat coastal path to the Radio Masts. Along the way there are some wonderful views over the Atlantic Ocean and the surrounding hills and countryside. You can extend your walk by continuing along the circular Dingle Way in either direction. If you were to head east for example you could visit Annascaul Lake . The picturesque lake sits in a wonderful remote spot surrounded by mountains and a beautiful river valley.",
