  "description": "Visit these wonderful waterfalls and enjoy woodland trails and views of Loch Ness. It's a very popular area for walkers with good footpaths taking you through attractive woodland to the spectacular 165 feet high falls. You can park in Upper Foyers and then follow a series of steps down to the gorge and the falls. There are two viewpoints where you can take in the full majesty of the falls and take some photos. After enjoying the rushing water you can return the same way by climbing the steps up to the car park. You can extend your walk by heading through the forest to the loch and the pretty Foyers Bay. You can then enjoy a stroll along the shoreline of Loch Ness before crossing the River Foyers where it enters the loch. Follow the same path back to the car park to finish the walk. There is a nice tea shop in the village where you can enjoy refreshment after the steep stepped climb. There's tables outside where you can enjoy great views across the loch. See the street view link to see the area.",
