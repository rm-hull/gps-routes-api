  "description": "This Lincolnshire Wolds walk takes you from the medieval village at Biscathorpe to another medieval site at nearby Wykeham. It's an attractive area with lovely views of the River Bain valley and some interesting historical sites to investigate. The walk starts at Biscathorpe Park next to the site of the ancient settlement. Here you can pick up the Viking Way and follow the waymarked trail north towards on Burgh on Bain and Grimblethorpe. The route then turns west, crossing the River Bain, before coming to Wykeham with its hall, pond and ancient village. The ruins of the 14th century church are still visible. Wykeham Hall survived the abandonment of the village, and still stands. The village is located just a few miles west of Louth where you can enjoy an easy waterside walk along the Louth Canal .",

The area also includes Goulceby and the unique landscape of the splendid Red Hill Nature Reserve. There's a steep chalk escarpment with wonderful views and some rare plants and flowers to see here. The long distance Lincolnshire Wolds Way passes through the area. The circular trail visits some of the highlights of the AONB on a decent waymarked footpath. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lincolnshire Walks page."
