  "description": "This Lincolnshire Wolds walk takes you from the medieval village at Biscathorpe to another medieval site at nearby Wykeham. It's an attractive area with lovely views of the River Bain valley and some interesting historical sites to investigate. The walk starts at Biscathorpe Park next to the site of the ancient settlement. Here you can pick up the Viking Way and follow the waymarked trail north towards on Burgh on Bain and Grimblethorpe. The route then turns west, crossing the River Bain, before coming to Wykeham with its hall, pond and ancient village. The ruins of the 14th century church are still visible. Wykeham Hall survived the abandonment of the village, and still stands. The village is located just a few miles west of Louth where you can enjoy an easy waterside walk along the Louth Canal .",
