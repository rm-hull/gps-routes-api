Crosskeys Bridge is the third bridge to cross the river Nene at this location. The first timber and cast iron bridge was built by Rennie & Telford in 1831. It was replaced by another, designed by Robert Stephenson, in 1850. The current bridge, a swing bridge like its predecessor, was built in 1897 and used to once cater for road traffic on one side and rail on the other. The railway reached Sutton Bridge in 1862 but with the Beeching cuts it was closed in 1965 and the bridge converted to purely road use."

Whilst there, he spent much of his time painting the geese that flew in from the adjoining marshland. The small nature reserve for wildfowl which he set up here was the predecessor to a much larger one at Slimbridge. Neither East nor its twin, the West Lighthouse situated across the river, were functioning lighthouses but built in 1881 as landmarks for ships entering the Nene. Both are private dwellings."

  "description": "This riverside village is located on the River Nene in the South Holland district of Lincolnshire. Both the Nene Way and Peter Scott Walk long distance footpaths run through the area. This walk from the village takes you along the Nene Way north to visit the Sir Peter Scott Lighthouse and The Wash Nature Reserve. The lighthouse was inhabited by the naturalist and artist Sir Peter Scott who bought a large area of the Ouse Washes and established a nature reserve. You can follow footpaths north along the river to visit the lighthouse and the reserve where you can look out for a wide variety of wildfowl. To continue your walking in the area head south along the river to visit the town of Wisbech .",
