  "description": "Walk from the town of Bakewell to the magnificent Chatsworth House in the Peak District. It's about a 3 mile route, following footpaths through the countryside to Edensor and then onto the estate. Though a short walk there is some moderate climbing to do along the way. Start the walk from the main car park in Bakewell and then pick up footpaths heading east past the golf club. The paths then head pass the dew pond on Calton Pastures and then through New Piece Wood. The path bends round to the north taking you into the village of Edensor. It's a very pretty place with a number of listed buildings, including the 19th century St Peter's Church. Chatsworth is the home to the Dukes of Devonshire, many of whom are buried in the churchyard. From Edenor it is a short stroll to the house, where you cross the River Derwent before coming to the entrance. Here you'll find 1000 acres of parkland to explore with views of the River Derwent, woodland trails and fallow deer.",
