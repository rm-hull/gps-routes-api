  "description": "A circular walk around Tindale Tarn, in the parish of Farlam and the Carlisle\u00a0district of\u00a0Cumbria. Start the walk from the former mining hamlet of Tindale where you can pick up trails heading west around the pretty tarn. There's lovely views of the Tarn Beck, the Bruthwaite Forest and Tindale Fells to the south. You'll also pass the pretty stone cottages at Tarn House which incorporates a Peel tower. The hamlet is also notable as the site where Stephenson's\u00a0Rocket\u00a0resided before it was donated to the\u00a0Science Museum\u00a0in London. You can also start the walk from the RSPB's Geltsdale car park at the eastern side of the reserve.",
