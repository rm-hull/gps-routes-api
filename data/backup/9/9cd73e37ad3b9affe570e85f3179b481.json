  "description": "A circular walk around Tindale Tarn, in the parish of Farlam and the Carlisle district of Cumbria. Start the walk from the former mining hamlet of Tindale where you can pick up trails heading west around the pretty tarn. There's lovely views of the Tarn Beck, the Bruthwaite Forest and Tindale Fells to the south. You'll also pass the pretty stone cottages at Tarn House which incorporates a Peel tower. The hamlet is also notable as the site where Stephenson's Rocket resided before it was donated to the Science Museum in London. You can also start the walk from the RSPB's Geltsdale car park at the eastern side of the reserve.",

      "content": "Head west and there's more waterside walks around Talkin Tarn Country Park and Castle Carrock Reservoir. There's also the peaceful Gelt Woods which can be reached on the circular Brampton Walk. Just a couple of miles to the north east of Brampton there's Miltonrigg Woods to explore. There's more peaceful woodland trails here with pretty bluebells in the spring and lots wildlife to see. Lanercost Priory is also located in this area. The English heritage run site was originally founded in 1169 as an Augustinian monastery. Today the substantial priory ruins are well worth a visit for the fascinating history and architecure. For more walking ideas in the area see the North Pennines Walks and Cumbria Walks pages."
