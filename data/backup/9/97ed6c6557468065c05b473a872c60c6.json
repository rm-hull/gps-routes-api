  "description": "This Cheshire based village lies just to the south of the city of Chester. It's a nice place for a stroll with historic buildings in the village and good footpaths along the River Dee which lies just to the east of the settlement. This walk starts in the village and takes you south along the riverside paths to neighbouring Aldford. On the way you will pass the impressive Eaton Hall, country house of the Duke of Westminster. The estate includes a fine mansion surrounded by beautiful formal gardens which are open to the pubic for a few days each year. As an alternative walk you could head north along the river into Chester. Here you could enjoy more waterside walking on the Chester Canal Walk or delve into the history of the area on the Chester Walls Walk .",
