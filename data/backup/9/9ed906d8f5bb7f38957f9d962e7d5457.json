  "description": "Climb to this gritstone edge and enjoy wonderful views over the Derwent Valley in the Peak District. You can start the walk from the Robin Hood pub car park just to the south of Birchen Edge. From here you can pick up the footpaths to take you across the gritstone edge to the wonderful view point where you will find Nelson's Monument. Next to this are three boulders carved with the names of three of Nelson's ships: Victory, Defiance and Royal Soverin. It's a splendid spot with interesting rock formations and fabulous views over the surrounding area. Just to the west you'll find Gardom's Edge. A public footpath runs past it towards Eagle Stone and Baslow Edge. This is a good option if you'd like to further explore this geologically fascinating area. You should see lots of rock climbers as you go. Birchen Edge is located very close to the splendid Chatsworth Park. Here you'll find 1000 acres of parkland to explore with views of the River Derwent, woodland trails and fallow deer. The Derwent Valley Heritage Way also passes nearby Baslow so you can enjoy a riverside stroll through the area. Also nearby is the spectacular Curbar Edge which has more interesting rock formations and expansive views of the Eastern Moors.",
