The surrounding villages include Rode, situated about 2 miles (3 km) to the south-west, and North Bradley, just a mile to the east. The Lambrok Stream, a tributary of the River Biss, flows near the village. It is fed by streams originating from the south and west of the parish. This stream flows to the south-east of Southwick before turning to form part of the parish's north-eastern boundary, which borders Trowbridge. The stream is an important geographical feature, contributing to the area's drainage and natural landscape."

  "description": "Southwick Country Park is a popular place for walkers with a series of well laid out walking paths linking a series of fields. It is located on the edge of Trowbridge in Wiltshire. This walk takes you through the 100 acre site and into the surrounding countryside where you can see woodpeckers, buzzards  and water voles. There is also a nature centre where you can feed the animals. See the video below for more details of this. To continue your walking in the area you could try our Trowbridge Park and River Walk which visits the lovely sensory garden in the park. Biss Meadows Country Park is also nearby and has some good riverside trails to try. The park is also located close to the town of Bradford on Avon where you can extend your walking along the Kennet and Avon Canal and the River Avon.",
