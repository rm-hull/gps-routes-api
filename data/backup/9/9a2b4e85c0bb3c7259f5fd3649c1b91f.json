  "description": "Explore Godrevy Head and enjoy wonderful views of St Ives Bay and the Cornish coast on this splendid coastal walk. The area is managed by the National Trust so there's good footpaths and facilities along this stretch of coast. Along the way there's pretty beaches, attractive countryside, heathland and a wide variety of wildlife to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for dolphins, seals and basking sharks in the water below. You can start the walk from the Godrevy National Trust car park off Churchtown Road, near Gwithian Bridge. You then head north along the coast path towards Godrevy Point where there are splendid views towards Godrevy Island and its lighthouse. The path continues along the headland to Navrax Point, passing Kynance Cove on the way. The route then turns south passing the lovely heathland of The Knavocks where you should look out for ponies grazing. The final section passes Castle Giver Cove and Higher Pencobben before finishing at Hell's Mouth where you can watch hundreds of seabirds around the cliffs. There is a cafe at Hell's Mouth where you can rest and take on some refreshment before heading back to the car park on the same path. You can extend your walk by continuing along the coast path to Portreath Walk . The path passes Reskajeage Downs, Carvannel Downs and Tehidy Country Park . The park is located just a few miles east of Hell's Mouth and contains 250 acres of woodland and lakes. There's nice cycling and walking trails and lots more wildlife to look out for around the lake.",
