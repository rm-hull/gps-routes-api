  "description": "This large West Sussex village is located west of Hassocks next to the South Downs. The village has an interesting high street with a number of historic properties dating from the 18th century and a 15th century public house of some note. This walk from the village takes you south across the Downs to Danny House before climbing to the splendid viewpoint on Wolstonbury Hill. Danny House lies just south of the village and is regarded as one of the finest stately houses in Sussex. The Grade I listed Elizabethan red brick mansion was built in 1595 by George Goring, on the site of an older house. The historic parkland estate covers 400 acres and includes a Bronze Age enclosure, eight acres of gardens and a large area of ancient woodland. Here you can see woodland flower species including butterfly orchid, early purple orchid, wild garlic and guelder rose. Butterflies such as white admiral and silver-washed fritillary can be found here too. Cricket is recorded in the Thomas Marchant\u2019s diaries as having been played at Sand Field, Danny Park in 1717. This makes Sand Field the earliest identifiable cricket ground in the world. The route continues south to climb to Wolstonbury Hill where you can enjoy wonderful views over the South Downs. There's an ancient hill fort, chalk grassland and lots of pretty summer wildflowers here.",

      "content": "The New Inn is an historic pub of some note. The inn dates back to 1450 and was built from old ships timbers, though the building now has a Georgian fa\u00e7ade. The cellar also has a strange tunnel (now bricked up) that is rumoured to lead to the church and Danny House some two miles away. Outside there's a lovely large garden area surrounded by beautiful flowers and old walls. In the summer there's garden parties, BBQ's, Hog Roasts, open air music & plays. You can find them on the High Street at postcode BN6 9RQ for your sat navs."
