  "description": "This Gloucestershire based town sits on the eastern side of the Forest of Dean. This walk from the town takes you into the forest to visit the Woorgreens Lake Nature Reserve. In the reserve there's marsh, lake, woodland and heathland habitats with lots of interesting flora and fauna. Keep your eyes peeled for birds such as cuckoo, crossbill and hobbies chasing dragonflies over the lake in the late summer. You can follow forestry tracks to the lake and then a waterside path around the small water. There's also a cycle track along a dismantled railway line in the area. To contine your walking in the area pick up the Speech House Walk, and visit the nearby Speech House Lake, the Cyril Hart Arboretum and the 17th-century hotel. There's also the popular Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail in this area.",
