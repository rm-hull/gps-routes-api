In the foreground the trail drops down a short but quite steep slope toward an embankment where it crosses Westwood Brook. It then turns to the right behind the trees in the dip and loops briefly off the edge of the picture before following the obvious line of trees (right to left) into the distance toward Pilsley. In the distance on the left are houses in the Station Road area of Pilsley. On the hilltop on the right is Cocktop (a farm). The white shapes in the field in the middle distance are birds scares."

  "description": "This is a super off road cycling and walking trail running from Grassmoor Country Park to Tibshelf. The route follows National Cycle Route 67 but there is also a detour at Wolfie Pond which heads east to the Williamsthorpe Nature Reserve before rejoining the route south. You can use this to create a circular walk along the trail. The trail follows the route of the old Grand Central Railway through the countryside passing the Locko bird and wildlife reserve on the way. The start and end points of the route are also delightful with Grassmoor Country Park at one end and the woodlands and meadows of Tibshelf Ponds at the other. The trail is located just three miles south of Chesterfield town centre. If you're are on your bike you could follow the Chesterfield to Alfreton cycle route along National Cycle 67 as an extension of your ride.",
