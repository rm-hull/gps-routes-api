  "description": "Enjoy a long, waterside walk along the River Yarrow in this splendid 700 acre country park in Chorley, Lancashire. The park has a number of well maintained walking paths, lakeside trails and a visitor centre. It is located less than 2 miles from Chorley town centre. The area is also a nature reserve so you can look out for a variety of birds as you make your way along the paths. Public footpaths branch off to the east of the park. You can pick these up and head to the nearby Duxbury Woods to extend your walk. There's more nice woodland trails along the Yarrow here. Just to the north you will find the pretty Astley Park which includes the River Chor, woodland, gardens and a beautiful lake.",
