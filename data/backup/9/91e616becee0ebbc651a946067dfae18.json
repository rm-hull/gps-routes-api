  "description": "Opened in 2011 this super, circular cycle and walking route, follows a series of safe, traffic free paths around Sheerness on the Isle of Sheppey. You will run along the attractive Isle of Sheppy coast and Sheerness beach, while there is also a pleasant waterside section along the Queenborough Lines or the canal bank as it is known locally. At the eastern end of the route you'll also pass Barton's Point Coastal Park where there's a pretty lake with birdlife and a beach. This is a nice family cycle ride as it takes place on flat, off road paths. Walkers looking for an easy circular walk will also find it suitable. The route is easily accessible, starting and finishing at Sheerness-on-Sea railway station.",
