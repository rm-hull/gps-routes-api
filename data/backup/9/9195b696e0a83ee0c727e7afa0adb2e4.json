  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the city of Winchester in Hampshire. The walk makes use of the Itchen Way long distance footpath to take you along the River Itchen to St Catherine's Hill before returning to the town centre on other public footpaths. The walk starts in the centre of the city near Wharf Bridge and the Wolvesey Palace. It's a nice waterside walk with the option of taking a short detour to climb St Catherine's Hill for nice views over the city and the surrounding countryside. You can extend the walk by continuing south along the Itchen to Shawford and Twyford. There are also nice footpaths across Twyford Down, just to the south east of the city centre.",
