  "description": "This delightful Norfolk town has some nice walking trails to follow along the River Bure in the town centre. There's also lovely nature trails to try at Hoveton Broad, just to the south east of the town. This walk takes you to the nearby town of Coltishall, using a section of the Bure Valley Path which starts in Wroxham. It runs for about 3 miles on fairly flat paths so it's suitable for most abilities. The walk starts on Wroxham Bridge over the Bure in the town centre. You follow the lovely riverside path north west to Wroxham Railway Bridge where you pick up the Bure Valley Path. The trail heads west through some attractive countryside before coming into Coltishall. Here you can enjoy refreshments at one of the pubs or cafes before returning the same way. To continue your walking in the area try the Hoveton Walk which visits the nearby Hoveton Hall. The 19th century house includes some beautiful grounds with stunning gardens, a pretty lake and popular snowdrop walks in February.",

Near here you can pay a visit to the lovely Blickling Hall where there are three colour coded trail to follow around the estate. You can also pick up the Marriot's Way rail trail on the Aylsham Aylsham Walk.If you head east towards Horning there are some nice footpaths around the Bure Marshes Nature Reserve, a fine riverside pub and a foot ferry service to take you over the Bure. The walk from Horning also visits the pretty Salhouse Broad. The pretty little broad is located just south east of Wroxham. The Coltishall Walk uses part of the Bure Valley Path to create a circular walk along the trail and the river. It's a particularly pleasant section of the river around the pretty village which is often referred to as the \"Gateway to the Broads\" as it marks the start of the navigable portion of the River Bure. A few miles south east you will find the delightful Ranworth Broad. There's a nature reserve here with a visitor centre, woodland, reed beds, a boardwalk and a huge variety of birdlife to see. There's also the noteworthy 16th century church of St Mary to visit in the village of Ranworth. The church has a 100ft tower which you can climb for excellent views over the area. To the east there's the splendid How Hill. This fine old house includes a nature reserve, tea rooms, beautiful gardens and riverside paths along the River Ant. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Walks page."
