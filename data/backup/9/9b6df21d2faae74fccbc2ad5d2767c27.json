  "description": "This circular walk around the Kent village of Lympne visits Lympne Castle and the Royal Military Canal Path . You'll also pass close to Port Lympne Zoo which has some nice landscaped gardens and an animal reserve. It's located to the west of the route and requires an entry fee. It is private land so please keep to the public paths as defined on the route map below. The walk starts at the public car park at West Hythe which is shown on the Ordnance Survey Map below. From here you can pick up the Royal Military Canal Path and follow it west along the water for just over a mile, passing the remains of Lemanis Roman Fort on the way. You can then pick up the Saxon Shore Way and head north before turning east past Lympne Place. The route continues east through Lympne village to Shepway Cross passing Lympne Castle on the way. The medieval\u00a0castle dates from the 13th century and is now used for corporate events and weddings. Please note the castle is private and generally not open to the public. There are some open days where you can enjoy a dining experience. At Shepway Cross you turn south past Lympne Park Wood before returning to the car park.",
