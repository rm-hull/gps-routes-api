  "description": "Enjoy a short walk to these pretty falls from the little village of Resolven in the heart of the Vale of Neath. It's about a one mile walk from the car park in the village to the spectacular 80 feet high waterfall. The route follows the St Illtyd's Walk long distance footpath through some attractive oak woodland. It's a lovely spot with carpets of bluebells in the spring and the rushing waters of the Melincourt Brook. There's also the added advantage of being able to go behind the falls and experience the rushing waters from close up. The Neath Canal runs past Craig Nedd near the start point for this walk. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the towpath and enjoy a waterside walk to Glynneath. There's also miles of trails in Rheola Forest to the east of Resolven. Our Neath Waterfalls Walk starts in nearby Pontneddfechan. It explores Waterfall Country visiting the spectacular Four Waterfalls Walk .",
