  "description": "This attractive Oxfordshire based town is in a great spot riverside and country walks. The ancient market town includes many 16th and 17th century buildings and the site of a medieval abbey. Eynsham is also very close to the Cotswolds AONB and the famous university city of Oxford. This circular walk from the village takes you south to visit the Thames Path and Farmoor Reservoir. The walk starts in the village and heads south east towards the 18th century Swinford Toll Bridge and Eynsham Lock on the river. Here you can pick up the waymarked National Trail and follow it south to the reservoir. You can then follow a lovely circular trail around the water with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. After rounding the reservoir you can then retrace your steps to the village. The walk can be extended by visiting the peaceful woodland trails in the expansive Wytham Woods. The woods are located only a mile east of the river path near Swinford.",
