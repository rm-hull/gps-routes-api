  "description": "This town on the Wirral is a great place for walkers with fine coastal trails and a lovely local nature reserve. This walk visits the Heswall Dales and Cleaver Heath Nature Reserve on the western side of the town. There's some pleasant footpaths on the reserve with lots of interesting sandstone outcrops and a variety of wildlife to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for Lizards, moths, butterflies, badgers and foxes as you make your way over the heathland paths. Flora includes pretty heather, woodland scrub and western gorse. The elevated position of the reserve also means there are fine views over the River Dee to enjoy from the high points. You can easily extend the walk by heading south to pick up the popular Wirral Way and exploring the splendid Wirral Country Park .",
