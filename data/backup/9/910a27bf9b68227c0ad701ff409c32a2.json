  "description": "This large Cumbrian town has some good coastal walking opportunites along Morecambe Bay and the Duddon Estuary. It's also very close to the Lake District National Park which is a walkers paradise. In the town you can visit a significant ancient abbey and enjoy a stroll along the docks where the town's ship-building heritage is on show. This walk uses sections of the Cumbria Coastal Way and the Haematite Trail to take you to the Sandscale Haws National Nature Reserve. The walk starts at the historic Furness Abbey on the north eastern fringes of the town. The 12th century abbey was once the second-wealthiest and most powerful Cistercian monastery in the country, behind Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire. The site is now run by English Heritage who premit access for a fee. You can then explore the ruins and the visitor centre where there are a number of stone carvings and effigies to see. After exploring the abbey you can pick up the Haematite Trail and follow it south towards the docks and coast. Here you can pick up the Cumbria Coastal Way at Hindpool and follow the waymarked footpath north to Sandscale Haws. The coastal nature reserve has some nice footpaths with sand dunes, lots of wildlife and views of the Duddon Estuary. After exploring the reserve the route retraces its steps back into Barrow.",
