  "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking trails in this large park in Sutton Coldfield. National Cycle Network route 534 runs through the park along the Plans Brook and there are other cycle trails on the western side of the park. There's 100 acres to explore with a lake, ornamental gardens and woodland. It's a nice area for a safe, family cycle or an afternoon stroll. To extend your outing you could head a mile north to New Hall Valley Country Park. You can follow National Cycle Network route 534 along the Plans Brook to get to New Valley where you will find more good cycling and walking trails and an 18th century water mill. Also nearby is Sutton Park with 200 acres of open heathland, woodlands, wetlands, marshes and lakes. Just to the south of the park you can pick up the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal at Tyburn and enjoy a waterside cycle or walk.",
