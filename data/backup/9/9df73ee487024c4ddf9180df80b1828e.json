Hawsker was a small intermediate stop and its ticket sales reflected this; it sold only 8,982 tickets in 1922. The station is now (2007) the headquarters of Trailways Cycle Hire and has old railway carriages used as accommodation on site."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from the village of Hawkser to nearby Whitby on the North Yorkshire coast. There's much to enjoy with fine coastal cliff top views, a photogenic old railway viaduct and a wonderful ancient abbey. The walk starts in Hawkser village and then follows a track north east to the coast where you can pick up the Cleveland Way. Follow the waymarked trail north west to Saltwick Bay and then onto Whitby where you will pass the famous abbey ruins. The walk then heads south through the town to Fishburn Park where you will pick up a shared cycling and walking trail along the Cinder Track. You can then follow this old railway line south east, crossing the old Larpool Viaduct and passing neighbouring Stainsacre before returning to Hawkser.",
