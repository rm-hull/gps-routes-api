  "description": "Explore the woodland, limestone, wetland grassland and scrub in this large National Nature Reserve near Peterborough. There's lots of rare plants and interesting wildlife to be found in the reserve. In particular look out for butterflies including silver-washed fritillary, purple hairstreak and white admiral. The reserve is located just to the west of Peterborough city centre with a parking area at the northern end. Extend your walking in the area by heading south and picking up the Nene Way through the lovely Ferry Meadows Country Park .",

      "content": "To continue your Nature Reserve walking head just a few miles north east to visit the Barnack Hills And Holes National Nature Reserve. There's a rather interesting and unusual landscape here with grassy undulating slopes in an ancient medieval quarry. The site is noted for some signficant flora and fauna as well. You can find the reserve on the western side of Barnack village near Stamford. Postcode for sat navs is PE9 3EU. The Peterborough Green Wheel is a great way of further exploring the city on a signed route. The fairly easy 20 mile circular trail visits Ferry Meadows, the River Nene Way and the villages of Marholm and Etton. It is suitable for both cyclists and walkers. Also for cyclists National Cycle Route 63 runs past the reserve. It will take you through the heart of the National Forest from Burton on Trent to Wisbech. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cambridgeshire Walks page."
