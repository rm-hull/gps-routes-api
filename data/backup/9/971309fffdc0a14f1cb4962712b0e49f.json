The acidic soils here support a variety of vegetation types, including maritime heathland, grassland, and scrub. Notably, the area is home to the nationally scarce Soft-leaved Sedge (Carex montana). On the steep, wet cliffs to the east, you can find Ivy Broomrape (Orobanche hederae) and Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum capillus-veneris), both of which are also nationally scarce species."

  "description": "This is an easy coastal walk from Carbis Bay to St Ives, with wonderful views over St Ives Bay. It's a good surfaced path, running along a section of the long distance South West Coast Path. You'll pass the golden sands of Carbis Bay beach, Porthminster beach and Porthmeor beach. The popular walk also visits St Ives Head before finishing on Porthminster beach, next to the Tate Gallery St Ives. The walk starts from Carbis Bay train station so you can get the train back from St Ives. You follow a path above the train line towards Porthminster Point and beach. The walk then descends to the town, heading along the beach to the pier and harbour. You then round St Ives Head before finishing at the Tate. The gallery has rotating modern art exhibitions, focusing on British artists. Nearby, the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden, in the modernist artist's former studio, displays her bronzes and other works. Boat trips go to the nearby seal colonies on the Carrack Rocks and other locations along the coast. The beaches are beautiful and there's numerous places to buy refreshments before the return leg of the walk. To extend the walk you can continue along the coast path on the St Ives to Zennor Walk. Heading east will take you to the lovely Hayle Estuary where there is a RSPB reserve and tremendous views of Porth Kidney Sands. The long distance St Michaels Way also passes through the area. Pick this up to visit the famous St Michael's Mount.",
