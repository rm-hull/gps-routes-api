  "description": "Enjoy a walk from Great Ayton to this iconic landmark on Easby Moor. Captain Cook's Monument is an obelisk 60 ft (18 m) high in memory of the great British explorer. This walk starts in the village of Great Ayton and climbs to the monument through woodland and moorland. You then pick up the Cleveland Way to take you across Great Ayton Moor to the wonderful Roseberry Topping . This distinctive hill commands wonderful views across the Cleveland Plain towards the Pennine Hills. The route then descends from Roseberry Topping to Great Ayton and the finish point. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb Roseberry Topping on the National Trust walk or continue east along the Cleveland Way towards Guisborough Forest and Walkway .",
