  "description": "Visit the fascinating ruins of Lesney Abbey and enjoy a stroll through the adjacent ancient woodland, on this lovely walk in south east London. To start your walk you can park at the Lesnes Abbey car park just of Abbey Road. Abbey wood train station is also very close to the entrance to the ruins at the northern end of the park. Just stroll along Abbey Road for a few minutes and the abbey ruins are just on your right. The abbey dates from the late 12th century and is dedicated to St Mary and St Thomas the Martyr. After exploring the ruins you can also visit the arboretum and the ornamental garden. The walk extends into Lesney Abbey Woods just to the south of the ruins. There's a nice selection of footpaths surrounded by pretty flowers such as daffodils, bluebell and wood anemone. Look out for wildlife including butterflies and a variety of woodland birds. The park has good facilities with a nice cafe and an exhibition giving details of the history of the abbey. The Green Chain Walk passes right through the grounds so there is plenty of scope for extending your walk. If you follow the trail east it will take you into Bostall Woods. Continue south east and you will soon come to Shooter's Hill and Oxleas Wood where there is an elevated terrace garden with fine views over the city of London and the countryside of the surrounding counties. If you head north along the path it will take you to the River Thames via the pretty Southmere Lake.",
