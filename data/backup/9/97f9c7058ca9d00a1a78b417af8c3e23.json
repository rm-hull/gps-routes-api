  "description": "Enjoy a walk through this lovely village known as the 'Venice of the Cotswolds'. The High Street is particularly picturesque with the River Windrush running through it with several pretty little stone bridges crossing. This walk makes use of the North Cotswold Diamond Way and the Oxfordshire Way to take you through the countryside to the nearby fishing lakes. You could also extend your walk by following the Windrush Way west along the river. The walk also passes Birdland which has a variety of exotic birds and a collection of penguins. There is a large pond full of salmon which can be fed by the public. The 1930s Model village and Model Railway Exhibition are also well worth seeing. To extend your walking from the village try our Circular Walk from Bourton through Naunton and The Slaughters . It will take you to the village of Naunton along the river before heading to The Slaughters where there's lovely paths along the River Eye to enjoy.",
