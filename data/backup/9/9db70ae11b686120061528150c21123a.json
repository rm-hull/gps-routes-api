  "description": "This walk climbs to Ragleth Hill above Church Stretton in the Shropshire Hills. It's a fairly steep climb but only about a 1.5 mile walk from the town centre. Though not as popular a climb as its neighbour of Caer Caradoc, the hill provides some truly excellent views. The walk starts from the train station in Church Stretton where you can pick up the Jack Mytton Way. This waymarked footpath will take you south toward Dryhill Farm before climbing to Ragleth Hill. The hill stands at a height of just under 400 metres, offering fine views over the town below and the surrounding countryside. If you look to the north you can see Caer Caradoc which offers an opportunity for extending your walking in the area.",
