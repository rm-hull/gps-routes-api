  "description": "This walk visits ruins of Ardvreck Castle on the shores of Loch Assynt near Lochinver, Sutherland. There is some roadside parking next to A837 on the eastern side of the loch. From here you can follow a footpath a short distance to the photogenic castle ruins. The castle dates back to the 15th century and sits in a striking location on a promontory jutting out into the expansive loch. There's also some wonderful scenery to enjoy as you make your way along the loch. You can extend your walking in the area by heading a few miles north east to visit Eas a' Chual Aluinn, the highest waterfall in the UK. The walk also visits Loch na Gainmhich, a popular starting point for the walk to the falls.",
