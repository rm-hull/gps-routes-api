The park contains 154 acres of free access parkland, 360 acres of farmland, delightful Edwardian rhododendron gardens (with views to Windsor Castle) and an Arboretum with a fine collection of specimen trees and a beautiful ornamental pond. There are also excellent facilities with a tea room overlooking the Edwardian gardens and designated picnic areas. Cycling is permitted, except in the Temple Gardens and the Arboretum. Cycle racks are located next to the tea room. For cyclists there is also the Beeches Way Cycleway. This 12 mile, signposted route joins Black Park, Stoke Common, Burnham Beeches and Dorney Lake allowing you to extend your ride if you wish. For walkers you may also like to try the Beeches Way Walk which passes through Black Park Country Park .",
