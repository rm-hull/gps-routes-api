  "description": "These delightful gardens near Kidderminster are perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll. There's well laid out footpaths taking you around the compact site. Highlights include the towering Crimean Pines, a Magnolia Garden and an Italian Garden with water features and a pretty fountain. There's also lovely tree lined paths and nice views of the River Severn and the Severn Valley Railway steam trains. It's easy to extend your walking in this lovely area if you have time. You can pick up the Severn Way and follow the riverside footpath north to Severn Valley Country Park and the village of Hampton Loade. Also nearby is the pretty Trimpley Reservoir and Eymore Wood with nice trails to follow around the water and through the adjacent woodland. You can visit these locations on our Severn Valley Railway Walk which starts from Bewdley and offer great views of the wonderful old heritage railway. The Upper Arley Circular Walk also visits the arboretum and the reservoir and is a shorter alternative. The Worcestershire Way long distance footpath passes nearby Upper Arley so this is another good option. Following it north east will take you to Kingsford Country Park and Kinver Edge .",
