  "description": "Follow the River Barle from Dulverton to the famous medieval bridge at Tarr Steps. The walk takes you along a section of the Exe Valley Way long distance footpath with river views and woodland trails along the way. The walk starts in the small town of Dulverton, close to the border with Devon. It's a great base for exploring Exmoor and includes the Exmoor National Park Authority headquarters. Head west from the town centre to Bridge Street where you cross the river on the Barle Bridge. The ancient bridge has 5 stone arches and dates from the middle ages. Follow the riverside path north west, passing Burridge Wood and Northmoor Common before coming to Brewer's Castle Iron Age Hillfort. You continue through Hawkridge before branching off to the right and arriving Tarr Steps. The old clapper bridge is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, dating from the medieval period. You can extend the walk by exploring the Tarr Steps Woodland National Nature Reserve which includes a wide range of interesting flora and fauna. The Two Moors Way runs along the river through the attractive woodland of the reserve. You could also head to nearby Withypool and visit Landacre Bridge. The medieval bridge is another picturesque spot in the national park.",
