  "description": "This is a lovely, largely traffic free cycle or walk across Rempstone Heath in Dorset. The route begins at Norden Station and soon enters the peaceful Rempstone Estate with its woodland, fields and heathland. On exiting the estate there are two alternative paths you can follow. The first heads towards the Sandbanks ferry with splendid views of Poole Harbour and Brownsea Island. The other takes you to Studland with its fabulous beaches and attractive coastline. Either of these make good alternative starting points for the ride although the Sandbanks ferry will be more accessible for most. Cyclists should use a mountain bike or hybrid as the off road tracks on Rempstone Heath are quite bumpy and sandy in places. Most of this route takes place on the traffic free Rempstone estate so is also suitable for walkers. To further extend your walk you could explore the Studland Heath Nature Reserve with its dunes, heathland and variety of wildlife. You can also pick up the South West Coast Path at the Sandbanks Ferry and head to Old Harry Rocks and Swanage. Just to the east you will find Godlingstone Heath where you can visit the impressive Agglestone Rock. The large sandstone block commands wonderful views across the heaths to the coast.",
