  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the pretty Lamaload Reservoir near Macclesfield in the Peak District National Park. The route runs for about 2 miles with some small climbs on the way. You can start the walk from the car park on the north eastern side of the water, just off Hooleyhey Lane. Then follow footpaths and country lanes around the site, passing through woodland areas as you go. It's a lovely peaceful place with great views across the water to the surrounding hills and countryside. You could extend the walk by following footpaths south west to visit Tegg's Nose Country Park. There's some excellent views to enjoy from the elevated park.",
