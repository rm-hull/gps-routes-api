  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk through this lovely nature reserve near Newport on the Shropshire/Staffordshire border. In the reserve you'll find well surfaced footpaths taking you through pretty woodland and along the large mere which is the largest natural lake in the West Midlands. The area is great for birdwatching too. Look out for\u00a0Eurasian curlew\u00a0and\u00a0common snipe from one of the bird hides. The reedbed habitat also supports reed warbler and sedge warbler\u00a0while marsh harrier and osprey have also been seen in the area. This walk takes you to the reserve from the village of Forton just north of Newport . You can also reach the reserve by bike using \u00a0National Cycle Network Route 55\u00a0and Regional\u00a0Route 75.",
