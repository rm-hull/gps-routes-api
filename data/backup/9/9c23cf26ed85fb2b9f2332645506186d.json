    "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk through this lovely nature reserve near Newport on the Shropshire/Staffordshire border. In the reserve you'll find well surfaced footpaths taking you through pretty woodland and along the large mere which is the largest natural lake in the West Midlands. The area is great for birdwatching too. Look out for Eurasian curlew and common snipe from one of the bird hides. The reedbed habitat also supports reed warbler and sedge warbler while marsh harrier and osprey have also been seen in the area. This walk takes you to the reserve from the village of Forton just north of Newport. You can also reach the reserve by bike using National Cycle Network Route 55 and Regional Route 75.",

There's also a noteworthy 12th century church and a 13th century castle. You can walk from the town to the nearby Cop Mere where there are more nice waterside paths to try. Just to the west there's the market town of Newport where you can enjoy another waterside stroll along the old Newport Canal. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
