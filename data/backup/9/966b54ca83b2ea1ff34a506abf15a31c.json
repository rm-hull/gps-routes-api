  "description": "This walk visits the Pewley Down viewpoint near Guildford. The route includes a canal-side stretch and a visit to Chantry Woods, before climbing the hill. The walk starts on the River Wey Navigation Canal near to the train station in Guildford. You follow the Wey South Path along the canal to Shalford Park where you pick up the North Downs Way. Follow it east and it will take you through Chantry Wood. The woods have some nice trails to try and pretty bluebells in the spring. Just before you reach Halfpenny Lane you turn north west and follow the Mile Path bridleway up to Pewley Down. From here there's nice views over the surround North Downs countryside and woodland. To extend the walk you can enjoy a climb to St Martha's Hill which is located just to the east of Chantry Wood. There's more great views over the Surrey Hills from here.",
