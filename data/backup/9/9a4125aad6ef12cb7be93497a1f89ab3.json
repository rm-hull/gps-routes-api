  "description": "This historic Buckinghamshire village sits in a fine riverside location in the Chess Valley. The pretty settlement includes a series of 17th and 18th century cottages around a village green with an old pump. Also of note is Latimer House, a red brick Tudor style mansion, designed by Edward Blore, and completed in 1838. This circular walk from the village takes you along the river to visit nearby Chenies. You'll then pass through West Wood before crossing the river and returning to the village. Chenies Manor House is one of the area highlights. The historic Tudor House is a Grade I listed building and is surrounded by award-winning gardens and several medieval features. Part of the walk uses a section of the Chess Valley Walk. This long distance waymarked footpath is a great way of further exploring the area.",
