  "description": "Enjoy waterside walking along the River Eden and Hoff Beck on this circular walk around Appleby-in-Westmorland. The route runs for about 7 miles on fairly flat paths, with wonderful views of the Eden Valley and nice woodland trails. The walk start from Appleby train station and crosses the river before turning south through the town. You then join a riverside footpath near to the Grade I listed Appleby Castle. The site includes a 12th-century castle keep and a mansion house. The interesting old buildings are set in an attractive courtyard surrounded by curtain walls. You can book history tours of the castle or hire the 15th century Great Hall for weddings and other events. After passing the castle you follow the trails south to the little village of Great Ormside. The village includes Ormside Hall, a 17th century house which incorporates the remains of a late 14th century tower house. The village has a cafe which is a nice place to stop for refreshments at what is approximately the half way point of the walk. The route then heads west through the countryside toward Hoff, passing the pretty Tilekiln Ponds on the way. At Hoff Bridge you pick up the Hoff Beck and the Dales High Way to take you back to Appleby. You also have the option here of taking a detour south to visit Rutter Force where there's a beautiful waterfall next to the photogenic Rutter Mill. To continue your walking in the Appeby area, head north to Dufton to pick up the Pennine Way long distance trail. You can then follow the path up to the popular High Cup Nick for wonderful views over the Eden Valley. The climbs to Murton Pike and Dufton Pike are also to be found in this area, just to the east of the settlement.",
