  "description": "This walk takes you from the village of Bushmills to the Giant's Causeway on the coast of County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The route links two of the major attractions in the area - you can visit the splendid Bushmills Whiskey Distillery and then enjoy a short walk to the spectacular Causeway coast. The trail heads north from the village, passing alongside the old Bushmills Railway. It's a surfaced path so easy walking and also suitable for cyclists. Along the way you can also enjoy some fine views of the surrounding countryside before coming the coastal section with its wondeful rock formations. You can return along the same path or catch the heritage train if you prefer.",
