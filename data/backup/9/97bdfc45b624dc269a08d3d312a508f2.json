  "description": "Visit this wonderful coastal headland on this exhilarating walk in South Devon. There's spectacular cliff tops, pretty beaches and great views along the coast. The spot is also significant as the southernmost point of Devon and a good place for wildlife watching. Look out for the rare cirl bunting and chestnut-sided warbler as you make your way through the area. There's also lots of pretty wildflowers and interesting plants, with orange tip, heath brown and red admiral butterflies fluttering around them. The walk starts from the Prawle Point car park, about a mile south west of the village of East Prawle. From here it is a short walk to the Coastwatch Lookout at Prawle Point. Here you will find the Coastwatch visitor centre with a wealth of information about the area. From the headland you can see various birds on the cliffs such as cormorants, razorbills, fulmars and little owls. There's also lots of pretty vegetation including tormentil, birds foot trefoil and autumn squill. After rounding the headland you head north to Gammon Head and Pig's Nose where you turn inland. Other footpaths then take you back to the car park. It's easy to extend your walk by picking up the South West Coast Path and heading north west towards East Portlemouth. Here you can catch a ferry over the estuary and visit Salcombe. There are nice walks here around the Salcombe and Kingsbridge Estuary and up to Bolt Head. Heading east along the coast path will take you past Lannacombe Bay to Start Point where you can enjoy interesting tours at the lighthouse.",

Inside there's a cosy, quirky olde worlde interior where you can enjoy a good range of meals and ales. On warmer days you can sit outside and enjoy views of the charming village green. You can find them in East Prawle at postcode TQ7 2BY for your sat navs."
