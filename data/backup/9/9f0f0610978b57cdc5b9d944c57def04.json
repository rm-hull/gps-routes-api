  "description": "This splendid cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway path from Caernarfon to Bryncir on the edge of the Snowdonia. It's a good surfaced traffic free path making it ideal for a safe family cycle or a leisurely walk. There are lovely views of the surrounding Welsh Countryside and mountains such as Yr Eifl (or the Rivals) and Snowdon. The route runs alongside the Welsh Highland Railway so you should also see some wonderful steam trains as you go. The route starts at Caernarfon at the impressive Caernarfon Castle, and heads south through the town, crossing the River Seiont on the way. You continue to Llanwnda and Groeslon where you pass the lovely Glynllifon Country Park. It's well worth taking a short detour from the path and visiting the park with its woodland, gardens, parkland and river. There is also a cafe, a maze and exhibits such as steam power pistons restored by Fred Dibnah. The route continues through Penygroes before the final stretch takes you to the finish point at the little village of Bryncir. The route uses part of National Cycle Route 8 or Lon Las Cymru. This long distance route can be used to extend the ride. The northern section is known as Lon Las Menai. It runs north from Caernarfon to the old slate harbour of Port Dinorwig (Y Felinheli).",
