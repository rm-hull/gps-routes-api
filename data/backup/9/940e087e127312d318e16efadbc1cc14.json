  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Dumbrock Loch in Milngavie. You can park at the car park in Mugdock Country Park which is just opposite the loch. Cross the road and you can then head through a gate and follow a footpath north to the small loch. It's a lovely place which is perfect for wild swimming. There's also some other footpaths around the adjacent Dumbrock Muir where you can see Highland cattle roaming around.",

      "content": "Head south and you can explore the country park which includes a visitor centre, a walled garden and nice waterside trails around Milngavie Reservoir. To the north, in Strathblane you can pick up the Strathkelvin Railway Path. This shared cycling and walking trail will take you towards Gartcosh via Kirkintilloch, with fine views of the Campsie Fells. Just to the north east of the park there's the pretty Loch Ardinning to visit. The loch is owned by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and is a great place for easy walks and wildlife spotting. Similarly Bardowie Loch is also nearby. To the north west there's the interesting Burncrooks Reservoir Walk which visits the unusual narrow rocky chasm at the Whangie before heading to the pretty reservoir. Near here there's also something of a hidden gem at the Devil's Pulpit in Finnich Glen. There's a wonderful deep sandstone gorge and rushing waterfall to see in this geologically fascinating area. The epic West Highland Way starts in Milngavie. You could pick up the waymarked trail and follow it north to Craigallian Loch and Carbeth Loch on the Milngavie to Drymen Walk."
