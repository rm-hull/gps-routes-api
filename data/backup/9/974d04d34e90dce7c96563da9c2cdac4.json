This circular walk from the village heads east to visit the splendid viewpoint at Mynydd Bodran. The walk starts in the village on the lovely old stone arched bridge. You can then follow country lanes east to climb Mynydd Bodran. From the hill summit there are splendid views down to the village and across the surrounding hills and countryside. On a clear day you can see as far as Snowdon and the Welsh coast. Continue east and you will come to the River Aled where you can follow a riverside footpath south to link with another country lane. Follow this west and it will take you past the woodland of Coed Bryn Kenrick before returning to the village.",

      "content": "Head a few miles north east and you could enjoy a walk around the splendid grounds of the 19th century Bodelwyddan Castle. The coastal North Wales Path can also be picked up to the north in nearby Abergele. Here you could visit the woodland, gardens and viewpoint at Gwrych Castle. The Grade I listed castle became famous in 2020 when it was used as the setting for the 20th series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! On the western side of the castle there's the small village of Rhyd y Foel where you can enjoy a climb to the Pen y Corddyn Mawr hill fort. There's photogenic limestone scenery and more fine views over the River Dulas valley from this interesting ancient site. To the west is the climb to Cadair Ifan Goch, a National Trust owned area. From the summit of the hills there are excellent views over the River Conwy Valley to the Carneddau mountains."
