It is estimated that the wood has been continually under coppice management for at least 300 years."

  "description": "This National Nature Reserve near Bury St Edmunds is one of the best places in Suffolk for wildlife. There's nice walking trails taking you through the woods to a lovely lake with a bird hide. Birds in the woods include garden warbler, blackcap and willow warbler. Other wildlife to look out for includes a variety of butterflies and deer in the adjacent fields. There's also lots of interesting flora with over 370 plant species. Woodland flowers include bluebells, oxlip, herb paris and ramson (wild garlic). There's three trails to try in the reserve. These will take you around the reserve and into the adjacent Monkspark Woods. To continue your walking in the are you can head west towards Stanningfield and pick up the long distance St Edmund Way. Following it north will take you into Bury St Edmunds where you can visit the delightful Abbey Gardens.",
