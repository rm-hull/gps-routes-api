  "description": "This 130 acre park includes waterside cycling and walking trails around Lower Gorton Reservoir. The park is the start point for the traffic free Fallowfield Loop cycle route which runs along the National Cycle Network to Chorlton. Our Audenshaw Reservoir Walk visits the park from Guide Bridge train station. It uses a section of the Ashton Canal and the Tameside Trail to visit the reservoirs and the park. It's a nice way to reach the park, particularly if you are coming by public transport.",
