  "description": "This pretty South Oxfordshire village is in a great spot for riverside walks and exploring the Chilterns Hills AONB. There's also a noteworthy Norman church and an 18th century pub for refreshments after your exercise. This walk from the village follows a lovely section of the Thames Path to the neighbouring settlements of Shillingford, Little Wittenham and Dorchester . The walk runs for just under 6 miles, following a flat riverside path for most of the way. Highlights include the delightful Benson Lock, a peaceful spot where you can watch the boats pass through the village. There's also picturesque bridges, weirs and some lovely countryside views to enjoy on the way. To continue your walking around Benson head south along the river to visit neighbouring Wallingford . The historic town is a fine place for a stroll with an interesting local musuem and a 15th century Town Hall and the ruins of the 11th century Wallingford Castle.",
