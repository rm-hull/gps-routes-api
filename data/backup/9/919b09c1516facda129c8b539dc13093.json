  "description": "Explore these stunning National Trust owned gardens on this short walk in the Cotswolds. The gardens were created by American horticulturist, Major Lawrence Johnston and contain a number of beautifully designed outdoor 'rooms'. Highlights include the kitchen garden, plant house, herbaceous borders and the orchard. There are also a number of peaceful footpaths to follow to the various secret gardens. If you would like to continue your walk you could follow the Monarch's Way to the pretty Cotswold hamlet of Hidcote Bartrim. Just a mile or so to the south you will find the pretty village of Ebrington with a wonderful 17th century pub and the 14th century Ebrington Manor. You can explore the area on our Ebrington and the Foxcote Estate Walk which takes you through some lovely countryside with streams, woodland and ponds. The Heart of England Way also runs through the nearby village of Mickleton. This long distance path will take you to Upper Quinton and Chipping Campden .",
