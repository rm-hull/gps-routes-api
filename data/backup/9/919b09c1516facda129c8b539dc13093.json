  "description": "Explore these stunning National Trust owned gardens on this short walk in the Cotswolds. The gardens were created by American horticulturist, Major Lawrence Johnston and contain a number of beautifully designed outdoor 'rooms'. Highlights include the kitchen garden, plant house, herbaceous borders and the orchard. There are also a number of peaceful footpaths to follow to the various secret gardens. If you would like to continue your walk you could follow the Monarch's Way to the pretty Cotswold hamlet of Hidcote Bartrim. Just a mile or so to the south you will find the pretty village of Ebrington with a wonderful 17th century pub and the 14th century Ebrington Manor. You can explore the area on our Ebrington and the Foxcote Estate Walk which takes you through some lovely countryside with streams, woodland and ponds. The Heart of England Way also runs through the nearby village of Mickleton. This long distance path will take you to Upper Quinton and Chipping Campden .",

      "content": "There's two excellent on site cafes where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. If you fancy a pub lunch we recommend The Ebrington Arms in the delightful village of Ebrington. The award winning pub does excellent food and is set in a wonderful village location with fine views of the surrounding Cotswolds countryside. It's a special place and was recently voted the UK's number 1 village pub by The Times. The inn also has an interesting history, with its charming stone building dating all the way back to the 1640s. Inside there's period pieces including wooden fireplaces and beamed ceilings. You can find it in the village on May Lane at a postcode of GL55 6NH for your sat navs. It's located just over a mile south of the gardens. The pub is also very dog friendly and can provide treats for your pet."

The Mickleton Walk starts from the village and visits Kiftsgate Gardens, Hidcote Gardens and Chipping Campden. Less than a mile to the south of Chipping Campden there's the neighbouring village of Broad Campden where you'll find the 18th century pub known as the 'local' of Father Brown, the crime-solving priest who stars in the BBC drama filmed in the Cotswolds.  The circular Upper Quinton Walk visits the house from the village to the north. The sister village of Lower Quinton includes a noteworthy 16th century pub once owned by Henry VIII. Just to the west is neighbouring Honeybourne where you will find many historical buildings including a noteworthy thatched pub which dates to the 13th century. The circular walk from the village visits Bretforton where there's an unusual National Trust run pub dating from the medieval period. For more walks in the area see the Cotswolds Walks page."
