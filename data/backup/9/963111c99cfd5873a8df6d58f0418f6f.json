  "description": "This West Sussex town is situated close to the South Downs where you can enjoy some splendid walks. This walk from the town visits some of the highlights of the area including Ditchling Common Country Park, Stoneywish Nature Reserve and the popular Ditchling Beacon, located to the south of the town on the South Downs. The walk starts just to the south of the train station where you can pick up a bridleway heading north east towards Ditchling Common. The common is a fine open space for walking with miles of trails and a wildlife pond. Follow the trails south through the common and you can pick up the Sussex Border Path at the south eastern edge. This waymarked trail will take you south through the countryside of the Low Weald to the village of Ditchling. Just to the east of the village is the Stoneywash Nature Reserve where there's some nice trails and lots of wildlife to see. Continue south through the village and you will soon come to the Ditchling Beacon Nature Reserve. There's a fine viewpoint here with excellent views over the surrounding area.",
