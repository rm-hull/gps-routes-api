  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle on the new waterside path around this beautiful lake and country park in Cornwall. The track runs around the perimeter of the lake and is great for families or anyone looking for a nice easy ride. There are also lovely views of Bodmin Moor and the surrounding Cornish countryside. A cafe overlooking the lake is perfect for rest and refreshment after your exercise. The circular trail runs for a distance of about 3 miles so should take around an hour to complete on foot. Siblyback Lake is located just a few miles north of Liskeard. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could visit the splendid Golitha Falls where you will find spectacular waterfalls in a woodland gorge.",
