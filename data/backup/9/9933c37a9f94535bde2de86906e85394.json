The area was developed from the first decade of the twentieth century onwards on land leased by Ambrose Gorham, then the major landowner in Telscombe. The cream buildings in the centre of the picture are now the Badger's Watch pub. Prior to that they were early 19th century coastguard cottages and the only buildings to be found along this stretch of the cliffs before 1900."

      "caption": "The point where Telscombe Cliffs becomes Peacehaven also means a change in cliff top road layout. There is some distance between houses and cliff edge in the former whilst the houses in the latter have an unmade road and fence before the cliff edge is reached. However, the section below the cliff is now protected by the sea defences constructed in stages between 1976-96. The Promenade itself is indicative of Peacehaven's development starting here and finishing above Friar's Bay on the eastern boundary of the town but split into sections by parks and a lack of roadway."

  "description": "This walk takes you along the Telscombe Cliffs Esplanade in the Lewes District of East Sussex. In the village there's a nice cliff top path with some splendid views over the coast. There is also access from the clifftop down steps to the quiet shingle beach. You can start the walk from the car park of the Smugglers Rest pub. From here you can follow the cliff top path east towards Peacehaven before finishing at the Meridian Monument. This monument marks where Peacehaven lies on the meridian. It's a great spot with more excellent sea views. You can continue your walking along the popular Undercliff Walk which runs just below the cliffs. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Telscombe Cliffs. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
