  "description": "This walk explores Thurstaston Common before heading to Wirral Country Park on the coast. It's a varied walk with woodland trails, pretty heather, hill climbs and wonderful coastal scenery to enjoy. You can start the walk from the car park in Royden Park and then pick up the footpaths heading south across the common. Here you'll find woodland, heathland and a viewpoint at Thurstaston Hill. There's lovely views over the Dee Estuary, the city of Liverpool and the Welsh coast from here. Also look out for the striking Thor's Stone, a large sandstone outcrop and a place of romantic legend. After taking in the views the route descends to Thurstaston Hall where you follow Station Road to Wirral Country Park. The coastal park is the first designated country park in Britain, opening in 1973. You can climb the 60 feet high, boulder-clay cliffs where there are splendid views of the Wirral Peninsula. There's also a visitor centre and a number of pretty ponds where you can look out for a variety of wildlife. Follow footpaths south east through the park and you will see another path leading off to the north east. This will take you to 'The Dungeon', a wooded ravine with a small waterfall. Turn left here and you will soon arrive back at the village and the common. This walk uses a section of the Wirral Way long distance trail near the coast. You can extend the walk by picking up the popular route. Heading north will take you to West Kirby, while heading south will take you to Heswall and Neston .",
