  "description": "This walk follows the Wareham Forest Way from Wareham to Sturminster Marshall . The expansive forest has miles of trails with ponds, viewpoints and heathland to explore. You start on the River Frome in Wareham and head north to Wareham Forest for a lovely wooded section through the heart of the forest. This section takes you through Wareham town, Wareham common and the River Piddle Valley before passing through the conifer plantations of the forest and its abundance of wildlife. After leaving the forest behind you pass through Old Park and East Morden before coming to the finish point at Sturminster Marshall. This walk is waymarked with signs along the length of the route. To extend your walking in the Wareham area you can pick up the The Hardy Way and follow it to Corfe Castle and Kimmeridge Bay .You are also very close to the Hartland Moor and Arne Nature Reserves. The Sika Trail cycling trail also runs through the forest and is suitable for walkers too.",
