  "description": "This beautiful nature reserve near Faversham has nice trails to follow along the Swale estuary and Oare Creek. It's a great place for bird spotting with a huge variety of wetland birds to look out for. You can start the walk from the car park and visitor centre on the estuary. You can then follow a section of the Saxon Shore Way and other footpaths to form a circular walk around the marshes. The route visits the little village of Oare where there's a 13th century church, an old windmill and two pubs where you could stop for refreshments. You'll also pass along the delightful Oare Creek with lots of boats and views over to Nagden Marshes. The Swale Heritage Trail also passes through the marshes so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Head west and you can visit Conyer, Sittingbourne and the pretty Milton Creek Country Park .",
