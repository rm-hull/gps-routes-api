  "description": "This circular walk visits Lanty's Tarn from the village of Glenridding in the Lake District National Park. The pretty tarn sits just to the south of the village. You can follow footpaths up the site where there's a pleasant footpath along the secluded and peaceful tarn. The walk then heads west through the Brownend plantation towards the pretty Mires Beck.\nAlong the way you can enjoy splendid views over Ullswater Lake and Grisedale. You then follow the Mires Beck north to Rattlebeck Bridge where you can pick up another waterside footpath along the Glenridding beck to return you to the village. To extend the walk you could head west to visit Red Tarn on a longer, more challenging walk. To continue your walking in the Glenridding area try the Glenridding to Aira Force Walk which visits a beautiful waterfall above the lake.",
