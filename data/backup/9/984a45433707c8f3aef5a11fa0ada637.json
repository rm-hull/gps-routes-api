  "description": "A circular walk around the Peak District village of Eyam, visiting Eyam Edge, Bretton Moor and the village of Foolow. Starting from the village centre you head north to the Plague Stone and Bole Hill. Soon after you come to Sir William Hill Road whcih you follow west to Eyam Edge and Bretton Moor. There's some lovely views of the White Peak from the elevated position of William Hill and the adjacent moor. The route then descends to Bradshaw Lane which you follow to the small village of Foolow. Here you'll find a nice village green with an ornate medieval cross and the Grade II listed St Hugh\u2019s Church. From Foolow you can pick up a public footpath heading east across farmland back into Eyam. To continue your walking in the area you can try our other Eyam Walk which takes you up on to Eyam Moor. Just to the east of the village you can pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way and enjoy riverside paths through Grindleford and Calver .",
