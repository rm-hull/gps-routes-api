Built in 1896 as the Station Bar, you can now enjoy refreshments on the former station platform and enjoy the view of the old railway line running past the door, which is now the Speyside Way long distance trail. The pub includes a garden area with fine views over the fields and car parking. You can find them at postcode AB38 9QP for your sat navs. The pub is dog friendly."
