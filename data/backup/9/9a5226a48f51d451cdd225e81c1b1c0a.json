  "description": "This is a lovely coastal walk from the town of Aberystwyth to the village of Borth along a section of the Ceredigion Coast Path. Borth is located about 5 miles north of the town with a nice footpath taking you along the beaches and cliffs. There's some moderate climbs along the way so a reasonable level of fitness is required. From the cliff tops there are fantastic views down to Aberystwyth and along the coast. The walk starts by the pier on the sea front of Aberystwyth, near to the train station. You then head north past Constitution Hill, a wonderful viewpoint with a large Camera Obscura giving a bird's eye view of 1000 square miles of countryside and coast. The route continues along the cliff top path to Clarach Bay, where you can stop for refreshments at the cafe. Here you'll also find a lovely beach and views of the Afon Clarach which runs into the bay. The path then climbs above Clarach Bay to Wallog where you will pass an attractive shingle spit named Sarn Gynfelyn. The final section takes you past the cliffs of Craig y Delyn before descending into the pretty resort of Borth. Features in the village include a nice sandy beach and an ancient submerged forest visible at low tide along the beach. There's also a train station so you can return to Aberystwyth very easily. To extend the walk continue north along the coast path to the Dyfi National Nature Reserve. The reserve includes lovely beaches, lots of wildlife, views of the Afon Leri and a visitor centre.",
