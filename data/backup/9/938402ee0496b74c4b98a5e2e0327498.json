  "description": "Castle Crag is the smallest hill included in Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. It stands at 290 m (950 ft) in the beautiful Borrowdale area of the Lake District. This walk begins at the pretty village of Grange and makes use of the Cumbria Way and the Allerdale Ramble to take you along the River Derwent before ascending Castle Crag.  At the summit you will find a circular cairn of slate and a memorial to Borrowdale men killed in World War I. The views of Derwent Water and Borrowdale are truly wonderful. The climb can also be started from nearby Rosthwaite . If you wanted to continue your walk you could follow the Cumbria Way north to the beautiful Derwent Water and enjoy a lakeside stroll. Another popular fell is the nearby Catbells which gives faboulous views across Derwent Water.",
