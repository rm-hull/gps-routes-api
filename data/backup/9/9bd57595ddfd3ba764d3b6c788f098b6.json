Unlike most Roman forts which are of decidedly square shape, this one follows the lines of the peninsula on which it was built. Originally the sea lapped against its walls but it is now nearly a mile away. The Normans used the fort for their overnight camp before the Battle of Hastings and soon after built the castle (seen here) in a corner of the fort. The castle was further fortified in World War II."

Work started on this brick castle in 1441, brick was an unusual material for a castle due it's weakness over stone, hence it was more of a fortified house than a true castle. In 1776 the interior was ripped out and sold, so until 1912 only the outer walls remained, then the interior was rebuilt. The castle is now owned by Queen's University of Ontario, Canada, they use it as an International Study Centre."

  "description": "Follow in the steps of William the Conqueror on this historic walk through the Sussex countryside. The 31 mile walk commemorates the famous battle fought in 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, Duke of Normandy, and the English army under the command of Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson. The route starts at Pevensey Castle where the Norman army stayed before proceeding to the Battle of Hastings. You then head through the countryside to the 15th century Herstmonceux Castle with its moat and Elizabethan gardens. The path then continues through Ashburnham to the fascinating Battle Abbey , set on the site of the 1066 Battle of Hastings. The final section takes you to the finish point at the attractive town of Rye via Westfield and Icklesham . Here you can visit Camber Castle , a ruined Device Fort built by King Henry VIII to protect the Sussex coast of England against the increasing risk of a French attack in 1539.
