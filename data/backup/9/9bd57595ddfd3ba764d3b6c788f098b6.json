Unlike most Roman forts which are of decidedly square shape, this one follows the lines of the peninsula on which it was built. Originally the sea lapped against its walls but it is now nearly a mile away. The Normans used the fort for their overnight camp before the Battle of Hastings and soon after built the castle (seen here) in a corner of the fort. The castle was further fortified in World War II."

Work started on this brick castle in 1441, brick was an unusual material for a castle due it's weakness over stone, hence it was more of a fortified house than a true castle. In 1776 the interior was ripped out and sold, so until 1912 only the outer walls remained, then the interior was rebuilt. The castle is now owned by Queen's University of Ontario, Canada, they use it as an International Study Centre."

  "description": "Follow in the steps of William the Conqueror on this historic walk through the Sussex countryside. The 31 mile walk commemorates the famous battle fought in 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, Duke of Normandy, and the English army under the command of Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson. The route starts at Pevensey Castle where the Norman army stayed before proceeding to the Battle of Hastings. You then head through the countryside to the 15th century Herstmonceux Castle with its moat and Elizabethan gardens. The path then continues through Ashburnham to the fascinating Battle Abbey, set on the site of the 1066 Battle of Hastings. The final section takes you to the finish point at the attractive town of Rye via Westfield and Icklesham. Here you can visit Camber Castle, a ruined Device Fort built by King Henry VIII to protect the Sussex coast of England against the increasing risk of a French attack in 1539.

      "content": "There's some good choices for refreshments in the lovely Rye Harbour area. The William the Conqueror pub is located right on the harbour and worthy of investigation. Recently refurbished, it\u2019s a smart, friendly, traditional pub, boasting real ales, hearty pub food and a friendly welcome. There\u2019s a large outdoor area here, with plenty of alfresco seating on the banks of the River Rother. It's a great spot to enjoy lunch while looking out for some of the local wildlife that make this a Site of Special Scientific Interest. You can find the pub near the car park on the eastern side of the reserve at postcode TN31 7TU. The delightful Avocet Tea Room is located in the same area as well. The tea room also includes a lovely art gallery showcasing the talent of local artists. The gallery is run by award-winning photographer Peter Greenhalf and former journalist Morgan (who makes all the cakes). The gallery reflects the artists\u2019 love of the natural world and is well worth seeing if you have time after your walk. At Pevensey Bay consider stopping off at the historic Castle Inn. The inn dates all the way back to the 16th Century. It's recently been tastefully renovated, with its low ceilings and oak beams it retains its 'old world' pub charm. The pub has a large suntrap garden which is enjoyed by many during sunny weather. It's also dog friendly and a great place to stop at for refreshments on the route. You can find the inn at a postcode of BN24 6HS for your sat navs. In Icklesham there's the Robin Hood which is an historic 17th century pub. There is a magnificent open fire and a large dining area to the rear offers locally sourced, home cooked food. The pub hosts pool and p\u00e9tanque teams and is the home of the local Bonfire Society. There is a large garden to sit out in on warmer days. It also has a children\u2019s play area. You can find them at postcode TN36 4BD. They are dog friendly."

      "content": "At the northern edge of Rye harbour there's the Rye Castle Museum or Ypres Tower. The museum has lots of interesting artifacts and exhibits to see including locally-made medieval pottery, an embroidery depicting many aspects of Rye life and history, medieval artifacts, activities and town maps. You can also climb to the top of the tower and enjoy fantastic views over the harbour and the river. It's a nice place to visit after your walk if you have time.  Above: Ypres Tower or Rye Castle. A worthy addition to your outing. At Battle you can pick up the 1066 Bexhill Link and follow it south to Crowhurst, the Fore Wood Nature Reserve and the coastal town of Bexhill. Between Hastings and Bexhill the route coincides with the Combe Valley Greenway. This shared cycle and walking route will take you through the lovely Combe Valley Countryside Park where you will find reedbed, fen, riverside paths, countryside trails, a nature reserve and a wide variety of wildlife.
