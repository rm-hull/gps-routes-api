  "description": "The Wendling Way is a waymarked walk forming part of Norfolk's Platinum Jubilee Trails. The  trail runs for just over 3 miles from Dereham to Gressenhall, passing through some attractive countryside on the way. Walk highlights include the Rush Meadow Nature Reserve in the valley of the Dereham stream, on the northern outskirts of Dereham. The site consists of species rich fen habitats with extensive areas of wet alder woodland. It's also great for wildlife with a number of bird species to see. The route then passes through The Wendling Beck Project, one of the most important and exciting rewilding projects in the country. Near the end of the route you could visit the Hoe Rough and Beetley Meadows Nature Reserve. It's a nice extension to the walk with peaceful riverside trails and wildlife such as otter, water vole and great crested newt to see.",
