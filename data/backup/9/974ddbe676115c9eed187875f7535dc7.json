  "description": "This popular coastal walk runs from Ballycotton village to Ballyandreen along a wonderful cliff top path. The route runs for about 5 miles (9km) with a number of seated viewpoints along the way. The area is great for wildlife watching so look out for Peregrine Falcons, herons, oystercatchers and sandhoppers on the way. You may also see dolphins and whales in the waters below during the winter months. Start the walk from the village, near to the lifeboat station. The pretty fishing village sits on a rocky ledge overlooking Ballycotton Bay. It includes a nice sandy beach stretching for about 16 miles to Knockadoon Head. From the lifeboat station there there are lovely views over to Ballycotton Island and the 19th century lighthouse. The path then heads west, passing Ballytrasna Beach and Doonen Macotter before coming to Ballyandreen Bay. Remember to bring your camera as the coastal scenery on the trail is simply stunning! To continue your coastal walking in Cork, head west to the stunning Seven Heads Peninsula on the Seven Heads Walk near Clonakilty. The long circular route visits a number of picturesque coastal villages, sandy beaches and lovely bays. Near here you will also find the Old Head of Kinsale which has a 4 mile loop walk to try.",

      "content": "Head east and there's another hugely popular coastal route on the Ardmore Cliff Walk. The specatcular trail starts at the noteworthy Cliff Hotel which includes a Michelin starred restaurant. Also to the east is the Knockadoon Cliff Walk near Youghal. Here you can enjoy fine views of Capel Island from Knockadoon Head. In Youghal itself there's also the Youghal Beach Boardwalk to try. The popular walk follows a splendid long boardwalk connecting the 3 beaches of the town. To the west of Youghal you can pick up the first section of the Midleton To Youghal Greenway. The shared cycling and walking trail will eventually run all the way to Youghal along the old railway line. A few miles to the west there's another local highlight at Charles Fort. The National Monument of Ireland dates back to the 17th century and includes good footpaths to follow around the Bastions. There's also some excellent views over Kinsale harbour and exhibitions where you can learn all about the history of the area. Also to the west there's more cliff top walking on the Crosshaven Cliff Walk. This fine circular walk provides wonderful views over Cork Harbour and visits the 16th century Camden Fort Meagher. To the north of Crosshaven there's the 13th century Blarney Castle to explore. The ancient castle is surrounded by some beautiful grounds and gardens with miles of footpaths to enjoy. Near here there's the circular Cork Marina Walk where you can enjoy fine views over the River Lee and a visit to the 16th century Blackrock Castle."
