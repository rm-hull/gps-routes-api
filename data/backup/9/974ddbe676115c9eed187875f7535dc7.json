  "description": "This popular coastal walk runs from Ballycotton village to Ballyandreen\u00a0along a wonderful cliff top path. The route runs for about 5 miles (9km) with a number of seated viewpoints along the way. The area is great for wildlife watching so look out for Peregrine Falcons, herons, oystercatchers and sandhoppers on the way. You may also see dolphins and whales in the waters below during the winter months. Start the walk from the village, near to the lifeboat station. The pretty fishing village sits on a rocky ledge overlooking Ballycotton Bay. It includes a nice sandy beach stretching for about 16 miles to Knockadoon Head. From the lifeboat station there there are lovely views over to Ballycotton Island and the 19th century lighthouse. The path then heads west, passing Ballytrasna Beach and Doonen Macotter before coming to Ballyandreen Bay. Remember to bring your camera as the coastal scenery on the trail is simply stunning! To continue your coastal walking in Cork, head west to the stunning Seven Heads Peninsula on the Seven Heads Walk near Clonakilty . The long circular route visits a number of picturesque coastal villages, sandy beaches and lovely bays. Near here you will also find the Old Head of Kinsale which has a 4 mile loop walk to try.",
