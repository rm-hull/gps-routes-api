  "description": "This super cycle and walking route takes you on the lochside path around Loch Katrine in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. You start off at the Trossachs Pier and Visitor centre at the south eastern end of the loch where cycle hire is available. You then pick up the excellent tarmac path which starts off fairly flat but does have some climbs along the way. There are great views over the loch and to the surrounding hills and mountains. You'll also pass Glengyle House, the birthplace of Robert Roy MacGregor, the Scottish outlaw and folk hero. The path runs for about 13 miles through woodland and countryside to Stronachlachar on the western side of the loch. Here you can catch the ferry back to Trossachs Pier or if you'd like to extend your outing head to the nearby Loch Arklet or Loch Ard. There's also another great cycling and walking trail along Loch Venachar and Loch Drunkie. Just to the east you will find Glen Finglas where you can enjoy a waymarked walk to the Glen's rivers, streams, waterfalls and reservoir. The climb to Ben Venue also starts from the car park at Loch Achray, close to Loch Katrine. It's a popular walk with great views back down to the lochs.",
