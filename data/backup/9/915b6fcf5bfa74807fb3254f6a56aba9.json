  "description": "This country park and nature reserve is located close to the town of Ashford in Kent. It's a great place for some easy waterside walking with footpaths running along the lakes, ponds and the River Great Stour which runs past the park. You can start the walk from the Julie Rose Stadium car park, on th eastern side of the park. From here you can pick up the footpaths heading around the three lakes, the grassland and the wetland in the park. The reserve is great for wildlife spotting so keep your eyes peeled for birds including hoveller, wigeon, tufted duck and Gadwall. In the summer months you should also see plenty of butterflies fluttering around the wildflowers.",
