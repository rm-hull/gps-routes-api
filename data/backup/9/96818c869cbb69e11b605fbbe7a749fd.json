  "description": "This walk takes you along the old Moray Firth coast line in Cullen. The disused railway line is now a pleasant cycling and walking trail that can be followed to nearby Portknockie. The flat multi user path runs for just over 1.5 miles, passing the photogenic Cullen Viaduct on the way. The impressive structure is one of the local highlights and often features in tourist guides and Scottish calendars. On the walk there's some excellent views of the surrounding coast and countryside. You can turn the linear route into a longer circular walk on the Cullen to Portknockie Walk which follows the Moray Coast Trail along Cullen Bay and Beach.",
