  "description": "This attractive Peak District village is surrounded by some lovely limestone hills, woods and countryside. It's an interesting place with plenty of old buildings including the Old Market Hall which dates from the 17th century. This building is owned by the National Trust and was the first to be acquired by the charity back in 1906 for the princly sum of \u00a350. The hall is well worth a visit with a series of interpretation panels detailing the history of the village and a scale model of Winster. This circular route uses the Limestone Way and the Derwent Valley Heritage Way to create a circular walk to the east of the village. On the way you'll visit Darley Dale and Matlock with some nice riverside paths along the River Derwent to enjoy. The walk starts in the village centre where you can follow footpaths south east to Lunster Rocks where you pick up the Limestone Way. Follow the waymarked trail south east and it will take you to Bonsall Moor, Upper Town and the pretty village of Bonsall. The route then turns north east passing Masson Hill before coming to the popular town of Matlock where you can pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way. Follow the trail north west and it will take you along the river to Darley Bridge. The route then heads west through Cambridge Wood, Cowley Knowl and Clough Wood before returning to Winster.",

      "content": "Head a short distance north and you can visit the neighbouring village of Birchover and visit the nearby Nine Ladies Stone Circle. Here you'll find several Bronze Age stones thought to depict nine ladies turned to stone as a penalty for dancing on Sunday. The popular Robin Hood's Stride can also be visited near the village. The splendid rock formation is one of the highlights of the area. There's also the Bronze Age Nine Stones Close Stone Circle just north of the rocks. Near Matlock you'll find one of the highlights of the area at Cromford Mill. This site is a significant part of the wider Derwent Valley Mills UNESCO World Heritage Site. It includes the world's first successful water powered cotton spinning mill which was built in 1771 by Sir Richard Arkwright. There's nice paths here around the mill complex and along the Cromford Canal. Head a few miles south and you could pick up the circular Brassington Walk and visit Middleton Top and the expansive Carsington Water. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
