  "description": "Climb to the tallest\u00a0waterfall\u00a0in the Peak District on this circular walk from the Peak District village of Hayfield . From the high points on the walk there are splendid views towards Liverpool, Manchester and North Wales. Also look out for mountain hares as you make your way along the route. Starting from Hayfield follow the Kinder Road up to Kinder Reservoir . Follow the footpath north along the water to William Clough on Leygatehead Moor, where there's pretty heather to see during the summer. Just before Ashop Head you reach the Pennine Way which you follow south east to Sandy Heys and Kinder Downfall. The 30-metre (98\u00a0ft) high falls are an impressive sight after rainy weather.\u00a0When there is a strong west wind the water is blown back on itself, creating a cloud of spray which can be seen from several miles away. From the falls you continue south along the Pennine Way to Kinder Low one of the highest points on the plateau. It stands at 633m and includes a white\u00a0trig pillar. You descend south to Edale Rocks where you turn to the west towards Kinderlow Cavern and back into Hayfield. To further explore the magnificent plateau try our Kinder Scout From Edale Walk or the Jacob's Ladder circular walk.",
