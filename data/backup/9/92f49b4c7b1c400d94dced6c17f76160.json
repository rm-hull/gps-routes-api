  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Kearsney Abbey Gardens in the Kent village of Kearsney. The site includes lovely grounds with ornamental lakes and views of the River Dour. It's a lovely place for a stroll with picturesque gardens, specimen trees and lots of wildfowl to look out for on the water. The park is located in the Alkham Valley where you can continue your walking. The Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty includes some fine footpaths and two significant historical sites including the ruins of St Radigund's Abbey and the 11th century St Peter's Church. Just head west through the countryside from the abbey to pick up the circular walk around Alkham village.",
