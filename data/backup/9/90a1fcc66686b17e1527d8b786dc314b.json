  "description": "This Norfolk based village sits just to the south of Attleborough on the popular Tas Valley Way walk. The village and its sister New Buckenham include some interesting buildings including an early 19th century windmill and a ruined castle dating back to the 12th century. In Old Buckenham you'll also find England's largest village green and a 17th century pub to relax in after you exercise. This walk takes you to the neighbouring village of New Buckenham, visiting the historic old castle on the way. You can start the walk in the village where you can pick up the Tas Valley Way and follow the waymarked footpath south east to New Buckenham. Here you can visit the ruins of the Buckenham Castle which dates back to 1176 and includes a moat. You then follow a footpath west to the Warren Plantation before heading north to return to Old Buckenham on public paths and country lanes.",
