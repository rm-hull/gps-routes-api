  "description": "This is a varied and interesting circular walk taking you on a tour of the countryside, villages and historic estates around Bristol. The walk starts in Keynsham at the confluence of the River Chew and River Avon and begins with a lovely waterside section along the River Avon before joining the Bristol and Bath Railway Path . You continue to Winterbourne , with a short section along the River Frome, and then through Stoke Gifford to Henbury where you will pass the splendid Blaise Castle . Described as 'the finest place in England' in Jane Austen's novel Northanger Abbey,  the estate boasts a 19th century mansion, an 18th century castle, a fascinating Victorian museum and 400 acres of parkland. From Henbury you continue through the suburbs of Bristol, crossing the River Avon on the Clifton Suspension Bridge next to the beautiful Avon Gorge Nature Reserve . This diverse ancient broad-leaved woodland is home to many rare plants and animals and is well worth exploring. Soon after you arrive at another walk highlight at the Ashton Court Park . Here you will find 850 acres of woodland and meadows including a deer park, mansions and landscaped gardens. The final section of the walk takes you to Pensford via Dundry Hill , where you will pass the impressive Pensford Viaduct , a Grade II listed building. You then join the River Chew for a delightful waterside section leading you back to Keynsham.",
