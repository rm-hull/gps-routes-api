  "description": "Visit this beautiful Island on the Pembrokeshire Coast and enjoy wonderful coastal views and thousands of breeding seabirds. The island has lovely walking trails along the coast and down the centre of the island. You can visit the island from April to October by catching a boat from Martin's Haven near Marloes village ( Click here for information on sailing times). The island is fantastic for wildlife watching with Puffins, Manx Shearwaters, Dolphins, Harbour Porpoises, Razorbills, Gannets and Fulmars to look out for. In April you can see the Atlantic Grey Seal as they gather to moult at North Haven. The island itself is lovely with fields, cliff tops and interesting coastal rock formations. In the spring and summer months it is covered with pretty flowers such as Bluebells and Campion. Look out for the Skomer Vole and the multitude of Rabbits as you make your way across the reserve. It's a special place and a must see if you are visiting the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. To continue your walking in the area you could explore the wonderful Marloes Peninsula on the Martin's Haven Walk. Also nearby is Marloes Sands and Marloes Mere. Here you'll find a bird hide where you can look out for a variety of birds visting the little lake. Near here you can also visit the lovely Dale Peninsula where you can visit St Ann's lighthouse and Dale Fort.",
