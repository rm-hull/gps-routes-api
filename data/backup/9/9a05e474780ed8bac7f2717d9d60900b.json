  "description": "This large village in South Devon is a nice place to enjoy a stroll. There's an attractive high street with lots of independent shops, a Grade I listed 14th century church and some lovely countryside to explore. This circular walk from the village explores the footpaths and country lanes to the south of the settlement. You'll visit the Mill Leat, Little Modbury and the Ayleston Brook on the walk. On the way there's some lovely views of the surrounding countryside and rolling hills.",

      "content": "Just to the west you can pick up the Erme Plym Trail in the neighbouring village of Ermington. Head south west and you could visit the delightful Wembury Point. There's a marine reserve here with a variety of sea birds and some of the most significant rock pools in the country. The Yealmpton Walk visits the area from the nearby village which lies on the River Yealm. In the pretty settlement you could visit the 400 year old Mother Hubbard's cottage. The quaint old dwelling provided the inspiration for the famous nursery rhyme. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
