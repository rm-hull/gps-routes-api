  "description": "This large village in South Devon is a nice place to enjoy a stroll. There's an attractive high street with lots of independent shops, a Grade I listed 14th century church and some lovely countryside to explore. This circular walk from the village explores the footpaths and country lanes to the south of the settlement. You'll visit the Mill Leat, Little Modbury and the Ayleston Brook on the walk. On the way there's some lovely views of the surrounding countryside and rolling hills.",
