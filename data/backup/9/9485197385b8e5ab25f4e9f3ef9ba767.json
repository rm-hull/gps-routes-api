  "description": "The small coastal village of Torcross sits in a lovely spot next to the large lake in the Slapton Ley Nature Reserve in Devon. This walk from the village takes you south along the South West Coast Path to Start Point via the neighbouring village of Beesands. It's about a 4 mile walk from the village to the lighthouse with the option of circling the headland when you get up there. The walk starts in the village car park and heads south along Bee Sands beach to nearby Beesands. You continue past Tinsey Head, Bickerton and Hallsands where you'll pass the ruined village at Wilson's Rock. You continue south east along the Start Point headland where you will find a lighthouse and steps down to a secluded beach. The area is great for wildlife with seals and dolphins to look out for in the waters below. There's also some wonderful views along the coast from the elevated position of the headland. You can extend the walk by continuing west to visit Prawle Point .",

The pub has an interesting history dating back to the 14th century when it was used by the local fishermen who worked their fishing boats from the village beach in front of the pub. The inn includes a lovely sea front patio where you can relax outside and enjoy sea views with some delicious sea food."
