  "description": "This large freshwater loch is located near Dunecht and Kirkton of Skene in Aberdeenshire. It's a very picturesque area with the loch surrounded by attractive woodland and reedbeds. It's great for wildlife too with concentrations of wildfowl in autumn and winter in particular greylag geese, goldeneye ducks and pink-footed geese. Common gulls and otters are also found on the loch. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit Drum Castle . There's nice trails through Drum Forest and an arboretum containing trees from all regions of the 18th century British Empire. There's also little Robbie Rossie's Loch which lies just to the east of the castle. Kirkhill Forest is located just to the north east. There's miles of good waymarked trails with hill climbs and great viewpoints to be found here.",
