  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along the River Cray in this lovely park and nature reserve in Bexley. There's a small car park off Rectory Lane on the south western side of the park. From here it is a short stroll to the river where you can pick up the London Loop long distance footpath. There's also footpaths through pretty wildflower meadows, ancient woodland and the impressive five arches bridge over the river. Look out for lots of birdlife including little grebe, grey wagtails and kingfishers by the river. It's easy to extend your walk in the area if you have time. You can follow the London Loop south west to Petts Wood and Scadbury Park where there are more nice footpaths through parkland, woodland and meadows. Also nearby is the Joydens Wood Walk which starts from Bexley train station. The woods have over 136 hectares (325 acres) to explore on miles of footpaths and bridleways suitable for cyclists. A couple of miles to the north there's Danson Park which includes a small pocket of woodland, acres of grassland, an attractive lake and well laid out gardens.",

It follows the London Loop to the meadows before heading to Joyden's Wood and the splendid Hall Place where there's a historic house surrounded by beautiful gardens. The Cray Riverway passes through the park. This pleasant waterside walk will take you south along the River Cray to the source at Orpington or north to Erith where it meets the River Darent and the Thames."
