  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this large forest on the South Downs near Eastbourne. There are trails for mountain bikers ranging from gentle off road trails to an exhilarating single track ride. There are two fairly easy waymarked trails for walkers. Look out for wildlife including rare butterflies and deer. This circular route starts at the car park and takes you along some of the bridleways in the forest. It also visits the pretty village of West Dean. It's easy to extend your outing by visiting the nearby Cuckmere River and Cuckmere Haven and Seven Sisters Country Park. You could also pick up the The South Downs Way which runs past the forest. Our South Downs Circular Walk also passes through the forest. It will take you on a tour of the surrounding area, visiting Seven Sisters Country Park and Birling Gap .",

      "content": "The Saltmarsh Cafe & Rooms is located on the western fringes of the forest at Exceat. The delightful cafe is set in a 16th Century farmhouse and includes a pretty courtyard where you can relax on warmer days. The rustic caf\u00e9, kitchen and bar serves a delicious menu with a focus on fresh Sussex produce. Dishes make good use of foraged and seasonal ingredients for a rich and distinctive flavour. Saltmarsh also does high quality accommodation if you'd like to stay in the area. You can find the cafe near the start of the walk in Exceat, on the East Dean Road at postcode BN25 4AD. At the eastern end of the forest there's the village of Friston and the noteworthy Tiger Inn. It's a quintessentially English pub, with its open fire, low-slung oak beams, real ales and hearty food. Dating from the 16th century the pub has been serving surrounding residents, farmers, soldiers, walkers, and smugglers for hundreds of years. There's a nice large outdoor area looking onto the pretty village green. It's a great spot to rest your legs and enjoy a drink before continuing the walk. You can find the pub in the centre of the village at a postcode of BN20 0BY."
