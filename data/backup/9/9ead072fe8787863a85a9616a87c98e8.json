  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this large forest on the South Downs near Eastbourne. There are  trails for mountain bikers ranging from gentle off road trails to an exhilarating single track ride. There are two fairly easy waymarked trails for walkers. Look out for wildlife including rare butterflies and deer. This circular route starts at the car park and takes you along some of the bridleways in the forest. It also visits the pretty village of West Dean. It's easy to extend your outing by visiting the nearby Cuckmere River and Cuckmere Haven and Seven Sisters Country Park . You could also pick up the The South Downs Way which runs past the forest. Our South Downs Circular Walk also passes through the forest. It will take you on a tour of the surrounding area, visiting Seven Sisters Country Park and Birling Gap .",
