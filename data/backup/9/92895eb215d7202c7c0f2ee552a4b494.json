  "description": "This steep sided gorge near Buxton is a lovely place for a peaceful walk. There's splendid cliffs of carboniferous limestone, the River Wye and some unusual riverside stepping stones. The area is also a nature reserve so there's lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. Look out for wildflowers including cowslips, early purple orchids, rock rose and the rare Jacob's ladder. Birds darting around the river and woods include dippers and wagtails. This circular walk takes you through the dale along the River Wye before exploring the area to the north of the river. On the route you'll pass along the popular stepping stones which run along the side of the river. It's a splendid spot with the wonderful limestone cliffs just above your head as you make your way along the stones. Please do take care along the stones particularly if the river is at a high level. You may need to find an alternative route if this is the case. Start the walk from the parking spaces on the Chee Dale Layby just off the A6. Just north of here you can pick up the Monsal Trail and follow it east through the dale to Wormhill Springs and the stepping stones. The route then leaves the river to head north to Hartsop Farm before heading west to pick up the Pennine Bridleway. You can follow the waymarked trail south past Flag Dale to Chee Dale and the car park.",

Heading west will take you through Wye Dale to Buxton. The circular Chelmorton Walk visits the dale from the village to the south. The village includes an ancient 11th century church and a fine 18th century pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Buxton Walks and Peak District Walks pages."
