  "description": "These peaceful woods near Grewelthorpe have miles of nice walking trails to try. It's a special place with grottos, old temples, follies, waterfalls and riverside paths along the River Ure. There's also a nice pond with a fountain, carpets of bluebells in the spring and a variety of woodland birds to look out for. The woods include the famous viewpoint at Limehouse Hill. The climb is well worth the effort as there are splendid views of Masham Church, The Ruin and Mowbray Castle which was famously painted by Turner. The Ripon Rowel long distance walking route passes through the woods so you have the option of extending your walk along the River Ure in either direction. This walk starts from the car park near the woods but you could also start from the nearby town of Masham and follow the Ripon Rowel along the river to the woods. It's about a 2 mile walk from the town. For a longer circular walk see our Grewelthorpe Walk which starts from the nearby village. Just to the west of the woods you will find Nutwith Common where there are miles of forest trails to try.",
