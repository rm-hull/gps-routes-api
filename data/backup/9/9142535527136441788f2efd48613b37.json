  "description": "This walk climbs to the Victorian South Foreland Lighthouse on the White Cliffs above St Margaret's. It's about a one mile walk from the town up to the lighthouse with great coastal views and a visit to the lovely Pines Garden on the way. The route starts at the public car park at St Margaret's Bay and follows a section of the South West Coast Path up to South Foreland. On the way you will pass the coastguard office on Bay Hill before following St Margaret's Road and Beach Road to the Pines Garden. The Gardens are well worth exploring with a waterfall and adjoining lake, a grass labyrinth and an organic kitchen garden with around 40 different species of fruit and vegetables. The site also includes the St. Margaret's Museum. The museum features changing displays about local history including St Margaret's during WW2, and one-time resident Noel Coward. After leaving the Pines the path continues past the Grade II listed St Margaret's Windmill before coming to the lighthouse. The lighthouse was the first to display an electric light anywhere in the world. You can climb to the top of the structure and enjoy great views over to France. There's also a nice National Trust tea room for refreshments after your climb. An alternative route is to park at the White Cliffs visitor centre and follow the White Cliffs Country Trails along the coast to the lighthouse. It's a slightly longer walk at 2 miles. If you wish to extend your walk from the lighthouse you can continue west along the coast path and visit Dover Castle .",
