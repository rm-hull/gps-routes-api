  "description": "Enjoy a walk around this popular tourist attraction built in the style of an Italian village. The village is located on the estuary of the River Dwyryd, about 2 miles east of Porthmadog. Portmeirion was used as 'The Village' in the 1960s television show The Prisoner. The photogenic village has some delighful architecture, pretty gardens and coastal views. After exploring the delightful village you can pick up woodland trails heading south west toward the coast. Known as the 'Wild Wood', it was planted in the mid-nineteenth century by Henry Seymour Westmacott and later by Caton Haigh, the foremost expert of his time on Himalayan flowering trees. There's nice peaceful footpaths leading along a stream to the coastal path. You can visit the village on foot from nearby Porthmadog by crossing the lovely Afon Glaslyn estuary on the Porthmadog Cob. See the Porthmadog to Portmeirion Walk for more details.",

      "content": "If you were to head a few miles east from the town you could explore the wonderful Snowdonia National Park and pay a visit to the beautiful Llyn Trawsfynydd. This huge lake has some lovely cycling and walking trails to try. Near the lake there's also an interesting historical site to see in the shape of Tomen y Mur. This ancient Roman Fort is located just a quarter of a mile to the north east of the lake's visitor centre. The fort was originally constructed in AD 78, and abandoned around AD 140. A millennium later, in the Norman period, the site was reoccupied and refortified with a motte within the old walls. You can still see these walls today. Informative plaques detail the history of the site and the views from the top of the motte are also excellent. To visit the site just follow a footpath north east from the visitor centre. Also to the east is neighbouring Penrhyndeudraeth where there are some lovely walks along the River Dwyryd estuary. Here you can also pick up the Ffestiniog Railway, a splendid heritage steam railway running into the surrounding Snowdonia National Park."
