  "description": "This stunning coastal walk visits the beautiful Cape Cornwall and the Botallack Mines near St Just. There is a National Trust car park right next to the headland from which this walk starts. You pick up the South West Coast Path and head around Cape Cornwall passing the lovely Priest's Cove and the remains of St Helen's Chapel. There are great views towards the Isles of Scilly and Land's End. You continue along the coast to Kenidjack headland where there is an Iron Age Cliff Castle, pretty wildlfowers and rare breed cattle. The next section follows footpaths along the coast and inland, exploring the fascinating ruins of the Botallack Mines. The mines were worked for tin and copper for over 500 years and include the Wheal Edward engine house and the Crowns engine houses. It's a great place for taking photos of the old ruined mining buildings with the backdrop of the coast and cliffs. You can also stop in the village of Botallack for refreshments before the return leg. The route then takes you through the countryside past Kenidjack Farm and Boscean, before picking up the coast path to return you to the car park. The long distance Zennor Churchway and Tinners Way passes the area so you could pick up this trail to further explore the area. The circular walk offers splendid views of the Cornish countryside and coast around St Ives and St Just.",

      "content": "Head south along the coast path and you could visit two of the highlights of the area at Sennen Cove and Lands End. To the north is the Geevor Mine and Levant Mine near Pendeen. Levant mine is notable as the only Cornish beam engine that is still in steam on its original mine site. The Levant engine sits in a small engine house in a dramatic location on the edge of the cliffs. Just to the south is the lovely Cot Valley at Porth Naven. The secluded valley is a fine place for a stroll with a picturesque stream and lots of wildlife to see. A few miles to the east you can pick up the Penwith Moors and Men-An-Tol Walk. This fascinating walk visits several ancient sites including Men-An-Tol standing stones and the Lanyon Quoit dolmen. You'll also pass the remains of the old Ding Dong Mines and climb to the fine viewpoint at Carn Galver. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
