  "description": "This pretty loch is located near Forfar, in the county of Angus. The loch is popular with anglers and bird watchers where you can look out for a variety of water loving birds at the site. Rescobie is fed by Lunan Water which enters the loch from the West and exits to the East. There's an interesting listed church on the northern side of the water to see as well. You can extend your outing by heading east to visit the nearby Balgavies Loch where there's a nice circular walking trail around the perimeter. Forfar Loch Country Park is also nearby.",
