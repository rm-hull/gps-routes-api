  "description": "This shared cycling and walking route runs along a disused railway path from Beverley to Market Weighton in East Riding of Yorkshire. The multi user route follows the flat easy path for a distance of about 10 miles. Along the way you'll pass old bridges and stations with some pleasant country views to enjoy too. The route starts off on the western side of Beverley and heads west, passing the medieval village of Raventhorpe and Cherry Burton. You continue through the pretty Etton Wold, passing the village of Goodmanham before finishing at Market Weighton. You can extend your exploration of disused railways by continuing west to pick up the Bubwith Rail Trail. The trail starts just over 2 miles west of Market Weighton and will take you to Holme-on-Spalding-Moor and the village of Bubwith.",
