  "description": "This long distance walk takes you from the city to the coast, following the route of the London to Brighton Challenge. The route runs for 100km (62 miles) following a series of public footpaths, minor roads and country lanes. It starts in Richmond Park in London and heads south through the North Downs, the Surrey & Sussex countryside before the final section through the South Downs to Brighton. You start off in Richmond Park in South London and follow the Thames Path to Kingston Upon Thames. You then leave the river and head through Old Malden and Stoneleigh before passing through Nonsuch Park in Ewell. The next stage takes you across Banstead Downs to Little Woodcote where you pick up a section of the London Loop to take you through Coulsdon, over Farthing Downs and through Happy Valley Park. You then head into the countryside of the North Downs, passing Chaldon, Bletchingley and Copthorne before a long woodland stretch through Worth Forest. You leave the woods, passing Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, Hayward's Heath and Plumpton where you join the South Downs. The final section then takes you over the South Downs to Brighton via Falmer .",
