      "caption": "Sparkley sea, Sizewell beach. The beach at Sizewell witnessed the historic landing of Henri Peteri and his brother Willem in September 1941. Departing from the Dutch town of Katwijk, the brothers embarked on a remarkable journey in a collapsible canoe, enduring 56 hours at sea. These courageous individuals, who escaped occupied Holland, were known as Engelandvaarders. Among them, approximately 1,700 reached England, with about 200 crossing the perilous North Sea. Regrettably, only eight out of 32 men attempting a canoe trip like the Peteri brothers succeeded in reaching the English coast. In 2005, Henri Peteri initiated the construction of a memorial to honour the men who undertook the challenging journey across the North Sea by canoe. The memorial comprises a pair of crossed kayak oars, symbolizing their remarkable feat, along with a broken paddle that serves as a poignant tribute to those who tragically lost their lives during the voyage. In June 2009, the monument was unveiled by Henri's widow on Sizewell Beach, alongside the original kayak used in the historic expedition. An inscription on the broken paddle reads: In memory of the thirty-two young Dutchmen who tried to escape to England by kayak during World War II to join the Allied Forces. Eight of them reached the English coast. Only three survived the war. The last living survivor dedicated this memorial to his brothers in arms who were less fortunate. He reached England \u2013 and freedom \u2013 on this beach on 21 September 1941."

The village is home to two distinct nuclear power stations, namely the Magnox Sizewell A and the Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) Sizewell B, which are prominently visible to the north of the village. Sizewell A has been decommissioned, ceasing electricity generation in 2006. The decommissioning process is anticipated to continue until 2027, with the site not expected to be fully cleared until 2098. Initially, there were plans to construct a third nuclear power station nearby. However, as of May 2013, significant doubts had arisen regarding the likelihood of reaching an agreement with the government. Nevertheless, in October 2021, the government announced new funding rules to facilitate financing through the Regulated Asset Base (RAB). \"Welcome to Sizewell, twinned with Chernobyl\" was a slogan adopted by anti-nuclear campaigners."

Sizewell Marshes constitute a 260-acre (105.4 ha) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest located adjacent to Sizewell in Suffolk. Situated within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, it forms part of a larger 356-acre (144-ha) nature reserve managed by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust, known as Sizewell Belts. These unimproved wet meadows hold significant importance, designated by Natural England for their exceptional collections of invertebrates, featuring many nationally rare and scarce species. They are also nationally significant for their array of breeding birds typically found in wet grassland habitats. The aquatic flora present within the marshes is diverse, including species such as the nationally scarce soft hornwort and fen pondweed."

The estate is under the ownership of the Ogilvie family. Initially, in the 1950s, it functioned as a progressive school catering to children aged 7 to 13. Over time, it has gained historical significance due to its association with a notable taxidermy collection. Presently, the Christian conference centre is operated by Sizewell Hall Ltd, a registered charity. In 2007, the centre accommodated approximately 6,500 visitors, primarily comprising local church groups from East Anglia, national organizations, and a local youth organization called CYM from Ipswich. Notably, CYM has developed an activity holiday program for schoolchildren known as the African Village, situated within the Hall grounds."
