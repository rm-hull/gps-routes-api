  "description": "This walk visits the 12th century Malahide Castle in the village of Malahide, near Dublin. The castle is surrounded by 260 acres (1.1\u00a0km2) parkland and gardens with miles of fine walking trails to try. Highlights include the The Talbot Botanic Gardens, located just behind the castle, which span multiple hectares and feature a diverse array of plants and manicured lawns. Included within the gardens is a 1.6-hectare walled garden and a collection of seven glasshouses, among which is a Victorian-era conservatory. The gardens are particularly noted for their collection of plants from the southern hemisphere, especially from Chile and Australia. These are a testament to the plant-collecting enthusiasm of the 7th Lord Talbot de Malahide, who was active in this pursuit during the mid-20th century. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Malahide to Portmarnock Coastal Walk . There's some lovely beaches and lots of sea birds to look out for on the trail.",
