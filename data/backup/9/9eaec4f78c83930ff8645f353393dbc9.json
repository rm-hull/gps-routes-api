  "description": "This walk takes you along the River Derwent from Grindleford to Hathersage along the River Derwent. The walk runs for just under 3 miles, making use of the waymarked Derwent Valley Heritage Way for most of the way. On the route you'll pass the ancient Padley Chapel and enjoy nice river views. The walk has train stations at both ends so you have the option of catching the train back. The walk starts from Grindleford train staion which is reachable from Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly. You then head west past Padley Chapel before turning north through Coppice Wood to the river. The riverside path takes you past Kettle House and Leadmill before turning north east to take you into Hathersage. You could turn it into a longer circular walk by returning via Hathersage Booths and Oxhay Wood, just to the east of the river.",
