  "description": "This delightful village near Bath is a fine place for a stroll with thatched cottages, a historic landscaped park and a pretty village green. This circular walk from the village visits Newton Park before climbing to Stantonbury Hill to the west. The grounds of the college are a lovely place for a walk with landscaped gardens and picturesque lakes to see. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths south west to Newton Park and the College. The Park is an 18th-century landscaped garden, designed by the famous landscape gardener Capability Brown. The western side of the site includes Corston Brook where there are a series of prettty weirs. You'll also pass the Grade II listed Newton Park House which was built in 1762. The route continues to the neighbouring village of Stanton Prior before turning north west to climb to Stantonbury Hill where there is an iron age hillfort. You then descend the hill and follow country lane and other trails east, passing along the other side of the park. There's nice views of the park's lakes as you return to Newton St Loe.",
