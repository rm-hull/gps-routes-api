The walk takes you across the Southern Highland of Scotland taking in some of the most beautiful countryside in the UK. Starting from Drymen on the West Highland Way it goes north east to finish in Pitlochry. The path passes a series of beautiful Lochs including Loch Venachar, Loch Tay and Loch Earn. You will also pass a series of spectacular waterfalls such as the Falls of Dochart and The Falls of Moness. There is also a waterside section along the River Tay with the Cairngorm mountains making a splendid backdrop.",
