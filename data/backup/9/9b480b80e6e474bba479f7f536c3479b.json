  "description": "This walk takes you along the Weardale Way from Wolsingham to nearby Frosterley. On the way there's nice views of the River Wear and the surrounding countryside. The walk starts on Wolsingham Bridge where you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it west. It's just over 4 miles on a gradually ascending path. At White Kirkley you'll leave the Weardale Way and follow another public footpath north into Frosterley. This section passes waterfalls, ponds and a number of quarries. The walk could be extended by continuing along the waymarked path into Stanhope. Tunstall Reservoir lies just to the north of the town. You could follow a public footpath heading north from the town along the Waskerley Beck. This will take you to the reservoir where there's a nice circular walk to follow around the water. The Waskerley Way also passes the reservoir. This waymarked cycling and walking trail follows the route of the old Stanhope and Tyne Railway line, visiting Waskerley Reservoir and Smiddy Shaw Reservoir .",
