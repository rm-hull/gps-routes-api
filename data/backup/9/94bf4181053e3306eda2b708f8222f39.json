Also nearby is the manor house, a large late 17th century building. The village's name, initially documented as Chedeham in 1193, originates from the Old English terms c\u0113od(e), signifying \"bay\", and h\u0101m, representing \"homestead\", or hamm, denoting \"peninsula\". The current construction of St. Mary's Church, constructed from flint and rubble, traces back to the 13th century, although there might have been a wooden precursor. Notably, the peninsula isn't referenced in the Domesday Book since it was encompassed within the Manor or Chapelry of Bosham, renowned for its fertile farming land and formerly owned by the Bishop of Exeter."

      "caption": "Salt-marsh Chidham. In 1812, an embankment wall stretching from Chidham to Bosham was constructed, utilizing an old quay. Reflecting on Bosham in the 1860s, Charles Longcroft recounted how the newly enclosed land was cultivated and sown with corn. However, in one fateful November, a fierce tide and gale wind swept in from the southwest, causing the embankment to collapse. By 1825, the sea had reclaimed the territory, submerging the farmland and engulfing recent constructions. Among these was reportedly a grand mansion situated at Cutmill, whose stones were subsequently repurposed in the construction of Cutmill Cottage."

  "description": "This short circular walk explores the area around the village of Chidham in West Sussex. The area has a number of footpaths taking you to the shore and intertidal mudflats of Chichester Harbour. It's an interesting and attractive place with fine coastal views, plenty of wildlife and some nice countryside too. This walk runs for just over 2 miles, starting from the village and taking you to the eastern coast of the peninsula. Here there are nice views over to Bosham with its pretty quay. The route then heads through the countryside to visit the picturesque Chidmere Pond, before passing Middleton Farm and returning to the start point. On the way look out for the large number of wildfowl in Chichester harbour and pay a visit to the anicent St Mary's church which dates back to the 13th century.",
