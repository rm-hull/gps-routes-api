  "description": "This large area of common land has some nice waymarked footpaths to try. The area is made up of attractive Silver birch woodland and gorsey heath with miles of ancient tracks to follow. You can start the walk from the car park off the New Road which leads north to the common from Berkhamsted. From here you can pick up the waymarked trails around the site. The circular trail takes you past Coldharbour Farm and Frithsden Beaches before returning to the car park. Look out for wildlife including wild deer and a variety of woodland birds. The common is part of the wider Ashridge Estate which includes 5,000 acres of woodlands, commons and chalk downland. You can further explore the area on the long distance Ashridge Boundary Trail or the Icknield Way Path. Heading north will take you through Thunderdell Wood and Aldbury Common to Moneybury Hill. Our Chilterns Pub Walk starts from the nearby Greyhound Inn in Aldbury. It visits Aldbury common before climbing up to the iconic Ivinghoe Beacon .",
