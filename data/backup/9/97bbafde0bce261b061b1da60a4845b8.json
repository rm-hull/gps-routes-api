  "description": "This large area of moorland near Bradford is a popular place for walkers and cyclists. There's miles of good trails and fantastic views of Leeds and Bradford from the elevated position of the moor. There's a good sized car park on Glovershaw Lane just to the north west of Baildon town centre. From here you can pick up numerous footpaths and bridleways suitable for mountain bikers. Head south from the car park and you can climb Baildon Hill which rises to a height of over 900ft. It's a great spot to soak up the far reaching views over the Yorkshire cities, towns and hills surrounding the moor. To extend your walking in the area you can head south and visit the delightful Shipley Glen before picking up the towpath along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The lovely glen is right next to the moor and is well worth a visit with its pretty beck and woodland trails. It also includes the splendid Bracken Hall Countryside Centre which has a wealth of information on the area. The River Aire also runs through nearby Shipley. The Bradford Millennium Way and the Dales Way Link also run past the western fringe of the moor. Both these trails will take you to Bingley Moor and Ilkley Moor if you follow them north. Just a few miles to the east at Guiseley you will find Esholt Woods which is another good place for walkers and mountain bikers.",
