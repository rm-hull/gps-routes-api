  "description": "Hartlebury Common and Hillditch Coppice cover 229 acres of lowland heath in Stourport-on-Severn. The area is criss crossed with a number of lovely waymarked walking paths where you can see many varieties of wild plants and insects, especially butterflies and moths. There are a number of habitats to enjoy including woodlands, heather covered hills, an acid bog, a pool and brook. Hartlebury Castle is located right next to the common so you could easily visit this interesting Grade I listed building on your walk.  It was originally built in the mid-13th century as a fortified manor house. It now houses the Worcestershire County Museum where you can find out about the history of the area. Inside there are period room displays including a schoolroom, a nursery and a scullery, while outside in the grounds there is a cider mill and transport display with a fire engine, hansom cab, bicycles, carts and Gypsy caravans. If you'd like to continue your walk then you could easily pick up the Severn Way and enjoy some lovely riverside walking.  Our Stourport Circular Walk also visits the common, the River Severn and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal.",
