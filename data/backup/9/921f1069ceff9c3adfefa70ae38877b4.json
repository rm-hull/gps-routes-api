  "description": "Climb to the highest point in Wiltshire on this circular walk near the village of Alton Barnes. The hill is located on the Pewsey Downs National Nature Reserve near to the Alton Barnes White Horse . The walk starts from the Pewsey Downs car park just to the east of the hill. From here you can pick up a footpath heading west past the white horse hill figure to Milk Hill. At the 295\u00a0m (968\u00a0ft) summit there are extensive views to the\u00a0Mendip Hills, the\u00a0Cotswolds\u00a0and in clear weather as far as the\u00a0Black Mountains\u00a0in\u00a0Wales. After taking in the views you descend to the north on another path. This soon joins with the Wansdyke Path and the Tan Hill Way . Here you have the option of heading west to visit Tan Hill (294m) the second highest point of Wiltshire. The long distance trails also visit some of the other hills in the North Wessex Downs AONB. This route continues the descent east to Red Shore where you turn south to return to the car park. To extend the walk continue west along the Tan Hill Way to visit Morgan's Hill which is also a nature reserve of the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust. Head east along the Wansdyke Path and you will soon come to West Woods where there's miles of peaceful woodland trails to explore.",
