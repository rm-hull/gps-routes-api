      "content": "At Shipley Park you'll come very close to Mapperley Reservoir which is worth a small detour from the route if you have time. The Erewash Canal also runs through the area. You can pick up the towpath and enjoy an easy walk or cycle along this pretty waterway. Here you can visit the impressive Bennerley Viaduct. Just to the east of the town you'll find the Nottingham Canal Nature Reserve at Cossall. There's a nice trail here with lots of water loving wildlife to see. Just to the south west you'll find Dale Abbey where you can visit the ruins of the historic 12th century abbey. The 18th century Locko Park is also located in this area."
