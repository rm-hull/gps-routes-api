  "description": "Wentwood Forest is located a few miles north east of Newport in South Wales. The expansive forest has miles of good woodland trails with bridleways and tracks that are also suitable for mountain bikers. Highlights include the lovely bluebells in the spring and fine views of the Severn Estuary from the high points in the forest. The area is also great for wildlife enthusiasts with 75 species of bird, including rare turtle doves, nightjars and spotted flycatchers to look out for on your visit. This circular walk in the woods explores the eastern area of the forest before heading to the picturesque Wentwood Reservoir which lies on its southern fringes. The walk starts from the Cadira Beeches car park in the heart of the forest at postcode NP26 3BA. Paths will take you around the eastern section before doubling back to visit the reservoir. You can follow paths around the water and climb to Gray Hill where there are fine views over the forest and the surrounding countryside. You then head north through Foresters Oaks to return to the car park.",

It then climbs Chepstow Hill before exploring the western part of the woods and climbing to the viewpoint near the car park. The woods are also located close to Newport and Chepstow where there are more good trails. You could try a waterside stroll along the Newport Canal Walk or visit the historic castle on the Chepstow Walk. You can pick up the Usk Valley Walk near the forest too. This will take you along the River Usk into the town of Usk if you follow it north."
