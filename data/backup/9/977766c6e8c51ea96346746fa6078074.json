  "description": "This walk in Dorset explores the area around Mudeford quay and green before catching the ferry over the water to Mudeford Spit. Here you can enjoy a walk along the beach and the dunes where you will pass the attractive little beach huts. The walk then climbs to the viewpoint on Hengistbury Head where you can enjoy some splendid views over Mudeford to the Isle of Wight. You can start the walk from the good sized car parking area at Mudeford Quay and enjoy a walk around the little park and picnic area with fine views over Christchurch Harbour . There's a nice cafe here for refreshments as well. To continue your walking in the area head east from the car park to visit Highcliffe Castle where there's some fine architecture and pretty gardens to explore.",
