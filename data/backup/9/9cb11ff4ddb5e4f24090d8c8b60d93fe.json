It was built some 100 years later and, as it wasn't practicable to divert the line, a causeway was constructed across the reservoir. The line is not officially closed but hasn't been used for twelve years. This is the view from the causeway looking north."

  "description": "Enjoy a nice circular walk around this pretty reservoir on Anglesey. Also known as Llyn Cefni the lake is located just to the west of the town of Llangefni. The lake and its surrounding woodland make for an easy afternoon stroll. On a clear day the mountains of Snowdonia make an excellent backdrop to the walk. You can start the walk from the reservoir car park, positioned at the northern end of the water. You'll find it just west of Rhosmeirch with a postcode of LL77 7RQ for your sat navs. From here you can pick up the footpaths heading through the woodland surrounding the lake. It's about 3.5 mile walk so will probably take about 1.5 hours at a steady pace. On the way look out for the tracks of the Anglesey Central Railway, although no longer used, they still run over an embankment which crosses the water. The area is also a designated nature reserve with bird hides where you can observe the wildlife which visits the area.",
