It was built some 100 years later and, as it wasn't practicable to divert the line, a causeway was constructed across the reservoir. The line is not officially closed but hasn't been used for twelve years. This is the view from the causeway looking north."

  "description": "Enjoy a nice circular walk around this pretty reservoir on Anglesey. Also known as Llyn Cefni the lake is located just to the west of the town of Llangefni. The lake and its surrounding woodland make for an easy afternoon stroll. On a clear day the mountains of Snowdonia make an excellent backdrop to the walk. You can start the walk from the reservoir car park, positioned at the northern end of the water. You'll find it just west of Rhosmeirch with a postcode of LL77 7RQ for your sat navs. From here you can pick up the footpaths heading through the woodland surrounding the lake. It's about 3.5 mile walk so will probably take about 1.5 hours at a steady pace. On the way look out for the tracks of the Anglesey Central Railway, although no longer used, they still run over an embankment which crosses the water. The area is also a designated nature reserve with bird hides where you can observe the wildlife which visits the area.",

      "content": "Llyn Cefni is the second largest body of water on the island after Llyn Alaw, which is also a reservoir. There's more nice trails and wildlife to see at the 770 acre lake. A couple of miles to the west of the lake is Llanddeusant where you can explore the fascinating Llynon Mill. The 18th century mill is notable as the only working windmill in Wales. The site also includes two Iron Age roundhouses where you can learn all about the ancient history of the area. In Llangefni we recommend a visit to the Dingle Nature Reserve. There's a nice tree lined boardwalk to stroll along here with various wildlife to see. Red squirrels, herons, buzzards and ducks can be seen on this interesting little trail. You can find it to the west of the town centre on the Afon Cefni at a postcode of LL77 7QE. The Lon Las Cefni Cycle Route starts/finishes at the reservoir. You can follow it south along the Afon Cefni to Malltraeth and then on to Newborough Forest. Much of the route is traffic free so also suitable for walkers. The trail can also be followed a short distance south to visit the Dingle Nature Reserve. The pretty reserve includes river trails, a woodland gorge and wildlife including red squirrels. See the Llangefni Walk for more details."
