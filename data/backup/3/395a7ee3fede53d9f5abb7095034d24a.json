  "description": "This challenging circular route explores the range of fells in the upper Kentmere valley area of the Lake District. The route visits some of the quieter areas of the national park while visiting a series of lesser known fells. There's wonderful views of several lakes, the surrounding fells, the Pennine Hills and the Lancashire coast. The path is generally pretty good for nearly all of the route. The walk starts from the village of Kentmere located a few miles east of Ambleside . You then climb towards Garburn Nook along Crabtree Brow and Garburn Pass. The route then turns north to Yoke Fell which stands at a height of 706 m (2,316 ft). From here there are great views of Lake Windermere, Morecambe Bay, Coniston and Langdale. From Yoke Fell you continue to Ill Bell where you will find a number of columnar cairns and splendid views towards the Scafells. The path continues to Thornthwaite Fell via Froswick Fell with great views of Kentmere Common and Kentmere Reservoir below. At Thornthwaite Fell you turn east towards Mardale Ill Bell and Harter Fell. Here you can enjoy nice views down towards Haweswater before turning south toward Kentmere Pike. The path then descends to Shipman Knotts with its rocky outcrops and steep slopes. The final section descends to Wray Crag and High Lane before returning to the village. To continue your walking in this area you could visit the nearby Brothers Water and Hayeswater. Also nearby is the excellent circuit of Haweswater .",
