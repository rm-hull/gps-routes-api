  "description": "This wonderful circular walk takes you through the beautiful Somerset countryside including the Quantocks. The path starts and ends in Taunton on the River Tone and heads north west towards West Bagborough. You continue through Lydeard St Lawrence and Wiveliscombe before a pleasant waterside stretch along the River Tone takes you back to Taunton via Bradford on Tone. In Taunton the trail links with the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal which offers more great opportunities for waterside walking or cycling.",
