  "description": "This wonderful circular walk takes you through the beautiful Somerset countryside including the Quantocks. The path starts and ends in Taunton on the River Tone and heads north west towards West Bagborough. You continue through Lydeard St Lawrence and Wiveliscombe before a pleasant waterside stretch along the River Tone takes you back to Taunton via Bradford on Tone. In Taunton the trail links with the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal which offers more great opportunities for waterside walking or cycling.",

The lovely pub is something of a local gem with its 17th century flagstone floors and inglenook fireplace. Outside there's also a fine courtyard garden to relax in. They serve an excellent Sunday roast and provide rooms and car parking. You can find them in Langford Budville at postcode TA21 0QZ."
