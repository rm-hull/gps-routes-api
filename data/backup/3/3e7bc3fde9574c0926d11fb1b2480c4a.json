  "description": "This is a nice, easy circular walk around Swinsty Reservoir in the Yorkshire Dales. The path is well surfaced and largely flat making the walk suitable for all abilities. The trail runs for a distance of about 3 miles so it's perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll. The walk starts at the car park on the eastern side of the reservoir and follows the footpath through woodland to the Fewston Embankment, passing Fewston on the way. You head along the Fewston Embankment with splendid views of both Swinsty Reservoir and the adjacent Fewston Reservoir. A woodland section through the Swinsty Moor plantation then takes you to Swinsty Hall, before coming to the Swinsty Embankment with great views of the River Washburn Valley to the south. A short waterside section past more woodland then returns you to the car park. It's easy to extend your walking in this lovely area by heading to the nearby Fewston Reservoir, Thruscross Reservoir and Lindley Wood Reservoir for more waterside walks.",
