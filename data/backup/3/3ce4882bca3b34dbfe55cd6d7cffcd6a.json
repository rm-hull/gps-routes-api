  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the beautiful Salcombe and Kingsbridge Estuary Nature Reserve on this walk in Devon. Start your walk from the car park at Lincombe Cross just to the north east of Salcombe. From here you can pick up footpaths along the estuary to Tosnos Point and Snapes Point at the southern end. Reed beds, mudflats and eelgrass beds all help to support an abundance of wildlife on the estuary. Look out for dolphins, seals, basking sharks and a variety of wading birds as you make your way along the paths. To continue your walking in the area you could try our Salcombe and Bolt Head Circular Walk which visits some lovely cliff tops and woodland near the town. Heading north will take you to the town of Kingsbridge itself, where there are nice footpaths to follow from the town to the delightful Bowcombe Creek. You can also catch the ferry over the estuary from Salcombe to East Portlemouth and follow the coast path to Prawle Point , the southernmost point of Devon.",
