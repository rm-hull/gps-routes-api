  "description": "This circular walk from the hamlet of Newby Bridge, climbs through woodland to Finsthwaite Heights and High Dam tarn. The little hamlet is in a lovely spot on the River Leven.  It's at the southern tip of Lake Windermere and one of the lesser visited spots in the Lake District. You can reach the village by catching a boat to Lakeside from Bowness . The old steam train on the Lakeside and Haverthwaite heritage railway will take you from Lakeside to Newby Bridge. The walk starts from Newby Bridge railway station on the heritage railway. You could also start the walk from Lakeside at Lake Windermere. From here you can pick up footpaths climbing through the woods to Finsthwaite Heights. It's a moderate walk, climbing to a height of over 600ft at the high point at High Dam. The walk then descends through more woodland back to the train station. Around Finsthwaite you can take a small detour and visit Bobbin Mill. The extensive working mill produced millions of wooden bobbins vital to the Lancashire spinning and weaving industries. It is the only working bobbin mill left in the Lake District today. You can learn about the history of the mill through tours and an exhibition. To extend your walking in the area you could visit Fell Foot Country Park on the other side of the lake. From here you can enjoy a climb to Gummers How for great views over the lake.",
