  "description": "This long circular walk encircles the historic market town of Bishop's Castle in Shropshire. The walk first heads to Clun with it\u2019s Norman castle, church and interesting houses. You continue to Aston-on-Clun and then to the spectacular Long Mynd (video below). This heathland plateau forms part of the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is owned by the  National Trust. The views are spectacular, making this section one of the walk highlights. The next section takes you to the rocky Stiperstones and The Bog lead mines, which are of great historical interest. The final section runs through Stapeley Common to the ancient stones of Mitchell's Fold before heading through Saddlers Little Wood and returning to Bishop\u2019s Castle. This section also passes the eye catching Corndon Hill which sits on the border between England and Wales. The walk is waymarked with a green and yellow disc.",
