  "description": "This seaside resort in Dorset has some fine coastal walks to try. There's also some pretty nature reserves with lots of wildlife to look out for. This walk takes you along a section of the South West Coast Path from the town to the famous Chesil Beach. It's about a 3.5 mile walk from the train station to the pebble beach where you can also access the Isle of Portland. On the way you'll pass the ruins of the 16th century Sandsfoot Castle and the beautiful Sandsfoot Cove. The walk finishes at the Chesil Beach Centre at Portland Harbour. The centre has information about the area and a good cafe for refreshments after your walk. The pebble beach runs for 18 miles with a series of beautiful lagoons on one side and the sea on the other. You can follow it all the way to the lovely Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens to extend the walk. The town also has some good wildlife spotting opportunities in two nature reserves located close to the town centre. Just up the coast to the north east is Lodmoor Country Park. The park is also a designated nature reserve with an easy access walking path taking you through various habitats including reedbed, saltmarsh and wet grassland. The RSPB Radipole Lake Reserve is also located close by. There's some nice waterside trails around the pretty lakes to try here.",

      "content": "On the Isle of Portland you could pay a visit to the Portland Quarry. Here you will find the noteworthy Tout Quarry Sculpture Park, a popular attraction on the island. The site includes many interesting sculptures by artist's such as Anthony Gormley. There's also a nature reserve with lots of interesting wildflowers and butterflies. Just a few miles to the west there's the worthy village of Langton Herring to explore. The settlement includes a 17th century village pub and nice trails leading to the Moonfleet Manor Hotel. The coastal hotel is in a fine position with wonderful views to enjoy with your delicious afternoon tea. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dorset Walks page."
