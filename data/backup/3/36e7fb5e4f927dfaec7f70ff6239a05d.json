  "description": "Travel through the Kent Downs AONB and along the Darent River on this beautiful walk or cycle. You start off near Sevenoaks Railway Station and head north through the delightful tranquility of the Sevenoaks Wildlife Reserve. The route continues towards Otford (with its 16th century Palace) and then onto Shoreham where you'll pass Lullingstone Country Park. As one of the oldest family estates in England (1497) Lullingstone Castle has an interesting history and attractive gardens making it well worth a visit. The next section takes you on to Eynsford and Farningham where the river is particularly attractive. This section passes Eynsford Castle and the pretty Farningham Woods Nature Reserve, which is worth a small detour from the path. From Farningham you enter the outskirts of London, passing Darenth Country Park and Dartford. You then finish at Dartford flood barrier - the world's second largest movable flood barrier. The route is also suitable for cyclists. It is part of the National Cycle Network as route 125.",
