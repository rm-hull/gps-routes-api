  "description": "Enjoy a short, peaceful stroll around this delightful Arboretum in the Thetford Forest area. There are three waymarked walking trails taking you to the arboretum's points of interest on well surfaced paths. This includes the Sequoia Avenue with its double rowed avenue of Sequoias planted in the 1800s to honour the Duke of Wellington. Other trees include Norway Spruce,\u00a0Chinese Fir, Serbian Spruce and an ancient oak planted in 1671. There are also pretty man made lakes with ducks and geese in the southern area. The woodland is great for birdwatching too - look out for Nuthatch, Chaffinch and Pheasants. The arboretum is located next to the historic Lynford Hall which includes 28 acres of formal gardens with a lake. To the south is Lynford Stag Walk which takes you through more of the surrounding expansive forest. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Brandon Country Park with beautiful lakeside lawns, a delightful walled garden and an excellent visitor centre. Thetford Forest is also excellent for more peaceful woodland walking. The National Trust owned Oxburgh Hall is also nearby. The large estate has some fine trails taking you through peaceful woodland and delightful formall gardens.",
