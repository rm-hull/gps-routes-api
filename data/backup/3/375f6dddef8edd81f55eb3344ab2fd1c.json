The junction reservoir forms a convenient base to moor private narrowboats between trips."

  "description": "A circular walk from Lapworth which follows nice sections of the Stratford Upon Avon Canal and the Grand Union Canal. You'll also visit the moated manor house at Baddesley Clinton and the tudor Packwood House. The walk starts in the small Warwickshire village of Lapworth which lies about 10 miles north west of Warwick. From here it is a short stroll to the Stratford Canal which you can follow east to Kingswood Junction where it joins with the Grand Union Canal. The route leaves the canal here to take a short detour along the Heart of England Way to Baddesley Clinton. The fine moated manor house includes blubell woodland trails in the adjacent Hay Wood, a lake and a walled garden. After exploring the house the walk returns to the Grand Union Canal which you follow north to Rising Bridge and Turnover Bridge where you leave the canal. Follow public footpaths south and then west through the countryside and you will soon come to Packwood House. The interesting tudor house is surrounded by grounds which include a lovely park with a lake, pretty gardens, fine topiary and woodland. After leaving the house you follow a series of footpaths and country lanes to return to Lapworth.",
