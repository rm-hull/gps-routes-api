  "description": "This pretty reservoir is located on the\u00a0River Avon near the village of\u00a0Stanford-on-Avon on the Leicestershire\u00a0and\u00a0Northamptonshire border. You can access the reservoir with a permit from Severn and Trent Water . This will allow you to follow footpaths along the water where you can look out for a variety of birdlife including\u00a0goosander, tufted duck,\u00a0wigeon,\u00a0pochard\u00a0and\u00a0shoveller. Several other rare species have also been spotted in this secluded spot such as Golden Oriole and Spotted Crake. You can start the walk from the car park at the eastern end of the lake, near to South Kilworth.",
