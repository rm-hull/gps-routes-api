  "description": "This pretty reservoir is located on the River Avon near the village of Stanford-on-Avon on the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire border. You can access the reservoir with a permit from Severn and Trent Water. This will allow you to follow footpaths along the water where you can look out for a variety of birdlife including goosander, tufted duck, wigeon, pochard and shoveller. Several other rare species have also been spotted in this secluded spot such as Golden Oriole and Spotted Crake. You can start the walk from the car park at the eastern end of the lake, near to South Kilworth.",
