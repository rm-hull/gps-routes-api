  "description": "Enjoy a walk through the Duke of Beaufort's estate on this easy circular walk in the Cotswolds. The walk starts in Great Badminton and heads to Little Badminton through Badminton Park. In the park there are two large ponds, several deer, attractive parkland and the 17th century Badminton House. At  Little Badminton you will pass the pretty Dovecote before heading into the surrounding countryside. You'll pass along the woodland of the Seven Mile Plantation before returning to Great Badminton via a countryside bridleway and a short woodland section. The area is best known for the annual Badminton Horse Trials held here since 1949.  The game of Badminton was also invented in the house in 1863. The Macmillan Way long distance trail runs just to the east of the estate. To extend your walking in the area you could pick it up and head south to the delightful village of Castle Combe .",
