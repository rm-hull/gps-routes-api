  "description": "Enjoy a walk through the Duke of Beaufort's estate on this easy circular walk in the Cotswolds. The walk starts in Great Badminton and heads to Little Badminton through Badminton Park. In the park there are two large ponds, several deer, attractive parkland and the 17th century Badminton House. At Little Badminton you will pass the pretty Dovecote before heading into the surrounding countryside. You'll pass along the woodland of the Seven Mile Plantation before returning to Great Badminton via a countryside bridleway and a short woodland section. The area is best known for the annual Badminton Horse Trials held here since 1949. The game of Badminton was also invented in the house in 1863. The Macmillan Way long distance trail runs just to the east of the estate. To extend your walking in the area you could pick it up and head south to the delightful village of Castle Combe .",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you could try our circular Sherston Walk. This visits the nearby village of Luckington and the 16th century Luckington Court which was used to represent Longbourn, the Bennet family home, in the BBC's 1995 TV series Pride and Prejudice. Just to the west there's the interesting market town of Chipping Sodbury. The Chipping Sodbury Walk starts from the town and visits the historic villages of Little Sodbury and Old Sodbury where there's a fine old church and hall to see. Just to the north west you could pick up the circular Hawkesbury Upton Walk and visit the National Trust's Horton Court. The Grade I listed manor house dates back to the 16th century and is surrounded by some pretty gardens. In the area there's also a historic 400 year old pub and the Somerset Monument to visit.   For more walking ideas in the area see the Cotswolds Walks page."
