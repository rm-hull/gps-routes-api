This Matlock to Buxton line was bitterly opposed, but it went ahead."

You can start the walk from the public car park, located behind the Monsal Head Hotel. The hotel is in an elevated position with tremendous views down to the valley and the viaduct from the viewpoint. From the car park you can pick up footpaths heading west to the bridge which you can cross on foot. The viaduct was built by the Midland Railway over the River Wye in 1836 and is some is 300 feet (91 m) long. The footpaths then run along both sides of the River Wye with weirs and attractive woodland to see on the way. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the Monsal Head Hotel. This includes the Stables Bar which has a nice outdoor seating area for relaxing in during the warmer months. The building's origin is a little uncertain, however it was part of The Railway Hotel, which was rebuilt around the late 1800\u2019s early 1900\u2019s from an earlier Inn on the site called, The Bulls Head. To continue your walking in the area pick up the popular Monsal Trail and follow it west to the lovely Cressbrook Dale and Miller's Dale. This popular beauty spot includes shady wooded valleys, rushing rivers and lots of interesting flora and fauna.",
