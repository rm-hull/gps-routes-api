  "description": "This circular walk in Camden takes you along the Regent's Canal and into Regent's Park. From Camden Road train station it's a nice waterside stroll to the park where you can enjoy miles of footpaths along the lake and through the beautiful gardens. Along the way you'll pass the famous Camden Market and Camden Lock. The vibrant market includes a huge variety of street food and outdoor bars on the water. The lock is fully functional and a great place to see how these devices work. Head west along the canal and you will soon come to Regent's Park. The famous Royal Park has 395 acres to explore with highlights including the stunning Queen Mary's Gardens with 400 varieties of roses and a lovely waterfall. After exploring the park the route returns to Camden Town train station. It's easy to extend your walking in the area if you have time. Continuing west along the canal will take you to the Paddington Basin where you can pick up the Paddington Canal. From here it's a short stroll to Little Venice where there's narrowboats, water cafes and a good selection of restaurants and bars. The long distance Jubilee Greenway also passes through the area. The 60km trail is a great way to visit the capital's highlights on foot.",
