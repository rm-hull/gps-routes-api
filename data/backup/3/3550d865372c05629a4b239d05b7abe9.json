  "description": "This rural Cornish village is a nice place to start a walk with trails along the River Camel and a signficant local pub to investigate after your walk. This route uses sections of the Camel Trail, the Camelford Way and the Copper Trail to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. The walk starts in the village and heads north along the Copper Trail to the Pendrift Downs. You'll then pass a series of old quarries before coming to St Breward. Just west of the village you can pick up the Camelford Way and follow it south to link with the Camel Trail, a shared cycling and walking route running along the River Camel. You'll pass Wenfordbridge and Wenford Dries before turning east at Tressaret to return to Blisland.",
