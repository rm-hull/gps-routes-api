  "description": "Climb to the highest point in the Quantock Hills on this circular walk in Somerset. Wills Neck stands at a height of 1,261 ft (384 m) and commands wonderful views of Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Brecon Beacons, the Mendips and Blackdown Hills. This walk starts at the Triscombe Stone Car Park and follows the Macmillan Way to the Wills Neck summit. You descend on the Samaritans Way South West. It's a nice walk on decent footpaths with some attractive woodland and great views. The walk can easily be extended by visiting the nearby Bagborough Hill, Lydeard Hill and the interesting Triscombe Quarry. You could also head a couple of miles south and visit the lovely Cothelstone Hill where there are more great views and a herd of Exmoor Ponies.",
