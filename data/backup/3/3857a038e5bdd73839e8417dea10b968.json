  "description": "This pretty Essex based village has some nice country trails to try. There's also a noteworthy old hall and views of the River Wid which runs to the east of the settlement. The village includes some fine old timber framed buildings and was listed as one of the best places to live in the UK in 2020 by the Sunday Times. This circular walk from the village heads south to explore the countryside around Ingatestone Hall and Buttsbury. The Grade I listed hall dates from the 16th century and was built by Sir William Petre. Today the manor house is open to the public on certain days between Easter and September. It includes some lovely grounds and formal gardens which are ideal for an easy afternoon stroll.",
