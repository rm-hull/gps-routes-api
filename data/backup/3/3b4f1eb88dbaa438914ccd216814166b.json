  "description": "This circular walk around Bromsgrove makes use of waymarked trails to visit the canal and countryside surrounding the town. You'll follow a section of the long distance Monarch's Way to visit the popular Tardebigge Locks on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. The route starts on the western side of the town where you can pick up the waymarked Monarch's Way footpath. Follow it south and then east through Charford to Aston Fields and then out into the countryside. The trail follows a country lane east to Cherry Trees Farm where you can pick up the canal. Follow the towpath west and you will pass Tardebigge Reservoir before coming to the impressive Tardebigge Locks flight. Here you will find the largest flight of locks in Britan, comprising 30 narrow locks on a 2.25 mile (3.6 km) stretch along the canal. At nearby Stoke Pound there is a nice canalside pub where you can sit out and enjoy refreshments. The route continues west past Stoke Pound Bridge to Stoke Wharf where you leave the towpath. Head north towards Stoke Heath, crossing the River Salwarpe before returning to Charford and the town centre. To continue your walking in the area follow the canal north east to Barnt Green and try our Barnt Green Circular Walk which visits Lickey Hills Country Park and the prety Bittell Reservoirs .",
