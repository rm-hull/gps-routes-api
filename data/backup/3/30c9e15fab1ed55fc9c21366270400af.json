  "description": "This circular walk from Much Wenlock explores the eastern end of the beautiful Wenlock Edge. On the way you'll visit old quarries, follow peaceful woodland trails and enjoy fine views over the Shropshire Hills. In the summer months you can also enjoy lots of wildflowers and the smell of wild garlic. It's about a 5 mile route with some moderate climbing on the way. The walk starts from the National Trust car park just to the west of the town. From here you can pick up the Shropshire Way and follow it up through Blakeway Hollow to Blakeway Farm and Major's Leap. This noteworthy viewpoint is the spot from where a Royalist major is said to have jumped on horseback to escape pursuers during the Civil War. From here there are fine views of Caer Caradoc and the Long Mynd. The route then heads toward Presthope where you can see the old Knowle Quarry lime kilns. After passing the limestone quarries you descend back to the town. To extend the walk you can continue along Wenlock Edge on either the Jack Mytton Way or Shropshire Way.",
