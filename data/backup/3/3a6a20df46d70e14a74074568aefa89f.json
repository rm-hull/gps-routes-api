  "description": "Enjoy an  easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir near Oxford. The walk starts from the car park and visitor centre on the eastern side of the lake. You then pick up the path which takes you to attractive woodland, Thames riverside meadows and nature reserves. The reservoir is an excellent place for birdwatching. Look out for Ospreys, Red Throated Diver and a variety of other water loving wildlife in the wetland nature reserves situated at the northern end of the site. It's a nice varied walk which runs for nearly 4 miles with great views of the surrounding countryside and the River Thames. You can also see a variety of watersports taking place for most of the year. The Oxford Green Belt Way and the Thames Path both run past the reservoir so you could pick up one of these long distance routes to continue your walk. Just to the east is the delightful Port Meadow with walking trails by the Thames and Oxford Canal. Less than a mile to the north east you will find Wytham Woods . There's 1000 acres of mixed woodland to explore on a network of footpaths here.",
