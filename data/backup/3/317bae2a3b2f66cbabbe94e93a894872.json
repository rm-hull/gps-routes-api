    "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around Broughton Castle and Broughton park on this interesting walk in Oxfordshire. The moated manor house is very picturesque with nice footpaths running across the surrounding grounds with good views of the north Oxfordshire countryside. You can also enjoy a stroll around the pretty Ladies' Garden with its variety of plants and flowers. The castle is only open on certain days so please check the website link below for opening times. You can walk around the pretty Broughton park at any time for free though! The history of the house is very interesting with the core built in the early 14th century. It was a centre of opposition to Charles I and was besieged and damaged after the Battle of Edgehill in 1642. You can enjoy an excellent tour of the house with its grand rooms and furniture. The castle is located just a few miles south west of Banbury . If you are coming from Banbury on foot or by bike you could follow the Salt Way track from the southern outskirts of the town.",
