  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around Broughton Castle and Broughton park on this interesting walk in Oxfordshire. The moated manor house is very picturesque with nice footpaths running across the surrounding grounds with good views of the north Oxfordshire countryside. You can also enjoy a stroll around the pretty Ladies' Garden with its variety of plants and flowers. The castle is only open on certain days so please check the website link below for opening times. You can walk around the pretty Broughton park at any time for free though! The history of the house is very interesting with the core built in the early 14th century. It was a centre of opposition to Charles I and was besieged and damaged after the Battle of Edgehill in 1642. You can enjoy an excellent tour of the house with its grand rooms and furniture. The castle is located just a few miles south west of Banbury. If you are coming from Banbury on foot or by bike you could follow the Salt Way track from the southern outskirts of the town.",

The historic pub dates back to the 17th century and was originally part of the castle estate. Inside there's some interesting old photos showing the pub in its thatched glory with a well in the garden and a rolling grass hillock down to the front of the pub which is now the car park. They serve good food which you can enjoy in the attractive garden area. You can find them at postcode OX15 5ED for your sat navs."

      "content": "The Bloxham Circular Walk runs close to the castle. You could extend your walk by picking up the trail and visiting the pretty village of Bloxham and nearby Milcombe. Head north of the castle and you will soon come to the little village of Wroxton where you can visit the splendid Wroxton Abbey. This 17th century Jacobean mansion is surrounded by beautiful grounds and public footpaths. On the walk there's also a visit to Drayton where there's a fine village pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Oxfordshire Walks page."
