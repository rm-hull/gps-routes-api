  "description": "This pretty reservoir on the edge of Exmoor has a nice walking trail running around the perimeter. The site is well managed with\u00a0two wheelchair and pushchair accessible paths and information boards\u00a0dotted along the route. Along the way there are great views across the water to the surrounding conifer woodland. Wildlife enthusiasts can look out for various waterfowl on the water and buzzards in the skies above. Start your walk from the car park at the northern end of the lake. Then head south to pick up the trails around the water. There's also some woodland trails to try as well if you have time. The reservoir is located just to the south of Blackmoor Gate, the western gateway to\u00a0Exmoor National Park.",
