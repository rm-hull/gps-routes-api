  "description": "This walk takes you through Staffordshire's beautiful Churnet Valley from Froghall to Cheddleton. The route follows the Caldon Canal and the River Churnet between the two towns with some stunning scenery to enjoy. The walk starts at Froghall Wharf on the Caldon Canal. You could also start from the Kingsley and Froghall Station on the Churnet Valley Railway. The station is located close to the canal and gives you the option of returning using the heritage railway. The route falls the towpath round to Consall where it takes a detour from the canal to visit Consall Nature Park. The lovely woods include a number of waymarked trails taking you to large ponds, streams and a more challenging climb to Kingsley Banks where there are wonderful views over the Churnet Valley. After exploring the park the route returns to the canal and continues to Consall Forge where you can stop for refreshments at the canalside Black Lion Inn. There's great outdoor seating with views of the canal and the passing steam trains. The canal continues into Cheddleton where you will find the Churnet Valley Railway centre and the train station where you can catch the train back to Froghall.",
