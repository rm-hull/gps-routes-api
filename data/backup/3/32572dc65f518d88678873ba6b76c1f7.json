  "description": "This West Yorkshire town is positioned on the River Aire and Leeds and Liverpool Canal near Skipton and Keighley. This circular walk around the town heads through the countryside around Silsden Reservoir to the north of the settlement. The walk starts on the eastern side of the town where you can pick up the Bradford Millennium Way. Follow the waymarked footpath north and it will take you towards Silsden Moor and Dales Bank Farm. Here you head east to cross the Great Gill Beck before turning south towards Swartha. Near here you pick up the Millennium Way again and head west back to the town. You can extend the walk by continuing south to pick up the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and enjoy a waterside stroll through the town.",
