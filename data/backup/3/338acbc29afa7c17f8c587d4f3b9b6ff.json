The Mayney family lived here from the 14th century until in about 1580 Anthony Mayney moved to Linton - his effigy is at Linton Church. The Mayneys were followed at Biddenden Place by the Hendens who flourished until, in about 1720, a William Henden \"having dissipated his patrimony pulled down the greatest part of the seat and left the poor remains of it and a very few acres of the old garden and park\". Thereafter the house was in divided ownership until its restoration by the Raymond family after World War II."

Sir John was Sheriff of Kent in 1566 and died during his term of office. The tomb has on it a fine brass depicting husband and wife and their fourteen children, the boys standing beside their father and the girls by their mother. Most of the inscription in raised lettering on stone cannot be read as it was chipped away by Roundhead desecraters during the Civil War. It was Sir John's father, another John, who in 1522 founded and endowed a school in Biddenden which still exists today as the \"John Mayne (C of E) Primary School\" with the Mayney crest and foundation date on its uniform."

  "description": "This delightful Kent village is a splendid place for an afternoon stroll. In the village there's a picturesque village green, a fine 15th century pub and a photogenic High Street with a number of\u00a0old Flemish weavers cottages\u00a0to admire. There's also miles of country and woodland footpaths to explore the surrounding landscape of the High Weald AONB. This walk from the village takes you to the nearby Hemsted Forest . The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths south to Goose Green and Fosten Green before entering the woods. There's miles of trails here with lots of woodland birds to look out for as you make your way around the expansive site.",
