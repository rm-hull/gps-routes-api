  "description": "This easy, circular walk takes you around the pretty Foulridge Reservoir in Colne. The reservoir (also known as Lake Burwain) has a good footpath running along the water with super views of Pendle Hill. If you'd like to extend your walk you could pick up the Leeds and Liverpool Canal for more waterside walking. Following it north will take you to Barnoldswick where you can try our Barnoldswick Canal Walk to Gargrave. Just to the west there's footpaths along Slipper Hill Reservoir leading north to Whitemoor Reservoir. The circular Colne Walk will take you to some of the other local reservoirs including Barrowford Reservoir which lies just to the south.",

      "content": "Head north west from the reservoir and you can enjoy a climb to Weets Hill. From the summit there are fine views over the town, east Lancashire, the north Ribble Valley, north Aire Valley and the Yorkshire Dales. Just to the east of Barnoldswick are the villages of Thornton-in-Craven and Elslack where you can enjoy a peaceful walk around Elslack Reservoir. There's also a fine 17th century pub in Elslack village which is well worth a visit. A few miles to the east there's Sutton in Craven where you can enjoy a climb to Lund's Tower and Wainman's Pinnacle. Known locally as the Salt and Pepper Pots there's fine views over the area from the elevated position of the monuments. To the west there's another monument and viewpoint in the shape of the 19th century Blacko Tower, located just north of the village of Blacko. The long distance Pendle Way can also be picked up here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lancashire Walks page."
