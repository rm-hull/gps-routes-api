  "description": "This easy, circular walk takes you around the pretty Foulridge Reservoir in Colne. The reservoir (also known as Lake Burwain) has a good footpath running along the water with super views of Pendle Hill. If you'd like to extend your walk you could pick up the Leeds and Liverpool Canal for more waterside walking. Following it north will take you to Barnoldswick where you can try our Barnoldswick Canal Walk to Gargrave. Just to the west there's footpaths along Slipper Hill Reservoir leading north to Whitemoor Reservoir. The circular Colne Walk will take you to some of the other local reservoirs including Barrowford Reservoir which lies just to the south.",
