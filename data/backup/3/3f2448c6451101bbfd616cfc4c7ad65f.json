  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Tanygrisiau Reservoir in North Wales. It's an attractive area with waterside trails, a heritage steam railway and wonderful mountain scenery. The walk starts from Tanygrisiau Train Station on the splendid Ffestiniog Railway . From here you can pick up footpaths heading south along the western side of the water. You'll pass the power station, Camfa Derw and the disused Moelwyn Mine. The route then follows paths round the eastern side of the water, passing a disused quarry and Moel Ystradau before returning to the train station. You can extend your outing on the circular Llyn Stwlan Dam Walk . The impressive dam lies just to the west of the Tanygrisiau Reservoir, with the accompanying power station on the western shores. There's some great views back down to both lakes from the vantage point on Moel-yr-Hydd to the north west.",
