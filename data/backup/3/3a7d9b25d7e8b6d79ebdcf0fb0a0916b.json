  "description": "This Lancashire based village is located between Southport and Preston on the lovely Ribble Estuary. This circular walk from the village takes you along the River Douglas to visit RSPB Hesketh Out Marshes Nature Reserve. The reserve lies just to the north of the village and is a great place to look out for a wide variety of birds. The walk starts from The West Lancashire Light Railway station at Becconsall. The narrow gauge railway includes seven steam locomotives. Head north and then east and you can link up with a footpath along the River Douglas. After just over a mile you turn west to follow a footpath along Hesketh Out Marshes. The reserve sits on the Ribble Estuary , one of the best birdwatching sites in the country. Species include pink-footed geese and wigeons in winter, with big flocks of wading birds like redshanks and lapwings.",
