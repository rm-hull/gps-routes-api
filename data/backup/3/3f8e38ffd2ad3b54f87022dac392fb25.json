  "description": "Visit this delightful glen in Betws y Coed and enjoy little waterfalls, rapids and cascades in a wooded gorge on the River Conwy. You can pick up the Fairy Glen footpath from the A470 north of the falls, next to the Fairy Glen Hotel. It is located just where the road crosses the river and runs for about half a mile through the glen. There are some steep steps to climb down so please take car when wet as they can be a bit slippery. The glen is a delightfully peaceful area with the rushing water surrounded by interesting vegetation and attractive woodland. If you enjoy this walk then you could head to the nearby Swallow Falls . These can be reached from Betws-y-Coed by following the Afon Llugwy to the falls. It's a lovely riverside walk, with woodland trails, the picturesque wooden Miners Bridge and a series of waterfalls to enjoy. Just south of Fairy Glen you will find Conwy Falls . It's about a mile down the river and consists of a short circular trail through the Conwy Forest Park.  This takes you to the River Conwy where you will find the lovely 50 ft waterfall.",
