  "description": "This linear walk joins these two picturesque Cotswolds village using a series of waymarked footpaths. The route runs for a distance of just over 4 miles, descending from the higher village of Stow on the Wold to the tourist honeypot of Bourton on the Water . On the way there's old mills, river views, rolling hills and a visit to the popular village of Lower Slaughter too. The route makes use of two of the waymarked trails which run through the area in the form of the Gloucestershire Way and the Windrush Way . As such it's generally a good footpath and well signposted throughout. In Lower Slaughter you could take a short detour from the route and try The Slaughters Walk which takes you between the two neighbouring villages on the River Eye.",
