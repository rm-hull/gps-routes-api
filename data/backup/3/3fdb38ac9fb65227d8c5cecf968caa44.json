  "description": "This delightful wooded glen is one of the most popular walks in the Argyll Forest Park. It's a very pretty site with a rushing burn, pretty waterfalls and lots of interesting vegetation. You can start the walk at the car park, located just off the A815, north west of Holy Loch. From here you can pick up the footpaths heading east through the attractive gorge with its mosses, ferns and rhododendrons. Along the way there's picturesque footbridges and steps to help you navigate the area. There's also a bird hide where you can look out for the many winged visitors to the area. The circular trail runs for about 1.5 miles but there are also woodland trails branching of it different directions. You could follow them south east to Holy Loch for example. The glen is also in a good location for continuing your walking. You could head a short distance to the north and visit Benmore Botanical Gardens where there's a world-famous collection of plants from the Orient and the Himalaya to North and South America. It's also a good place for refreshments after your exercise with some nice tea rooms. The stunning walk through Glen Massan also starts here. There's also some nice waterside walking to be found at the beautiful Loch Eck and Loch Long .",

To the north of Arrochar there's also the impressive Loch Sloy Dam where you can enjoy fine views down to the loch below. Ben Vorlich is also near the loch and a good climb to try in the area. To the north you can pick up the Lochgoilhead and Loch Goil Walk and explore the area around the pretty village. The loch is an arm of Loch Long and includes more pleasant waterside trails with some waterfalls to visit on the nearby Donich Water. For more walking ideas in the area see the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs Walks page."
