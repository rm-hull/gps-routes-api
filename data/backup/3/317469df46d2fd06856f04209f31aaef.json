  "description": "Enjoy an easy waterside walk through the beautiful Heddon Valley in Exmoor. The riverside footpath leads through woodland before the beautiful coast and cliffs of Heddon's mouth come in to view. The walk starts at the National Trust car park and heads north through Heddon's Mouth Wood to the coast through Heddon's mouth with its imposing cliffs. The point where the valley opens out to reveal the sea and cliffs is really lovely. The path then leads down to the pebble beach where you will find a 19th century lime kiln. The area is great for wildlife spotting. Look out for otters and various birds suchs as\u00a0dippers, grey wagtails and herons. In summer the area is covered with yellow gorse flowers and heather. If you would like to extend your walking in the area then you could head east towards Trentishoe Down for views of the beautiful Elwill Bay. You could also climb the Hangman Hills for tremendous views over Combe Martin .  If you head east you will find the lovely wooded cove at Woody Bay with a secluded pebble beach.",
