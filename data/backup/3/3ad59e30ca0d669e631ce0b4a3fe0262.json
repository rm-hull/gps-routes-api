  "description": "This market town in County Durham is positioned in a scenic area in the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). You can explore the area on the Pennine Way long distance trail which runs past the town. The river Tees also runs through the area with the Teesdale Way another great option for walkers. This walk picks up a nice section of the Pennine Way to take you to the nearby Grassholme and Selset Reservoirs. On the way you'll pass Kirkcarrion, an eye-catching clump of trees surmounting a rocky hill overlooking the Brough to Middleton-in-Teesdale road. You'll also skirt the south-eastern flank of Harter Fell which reaches a height of 481 metres about 1 km north of the hamlet of Thringarth. There's fine views over the AONB from the high points. The final section takes you through pretty Lunedale, finishing at Grassholme Reservoir. There's a circular footpath here around the water which is surrounded by the lovely Lune Valley countryside and woodland. To extend the walk you could continue along the Pennine Way to the Balderhead, Blackton and Hury Reservoirs. You could also follow the River Tees West and visit High Force Waterfall. It's one of the biggest waterfalls in England and a spectacular sight with the water dropping 70 feet (21m) into a plunge pool below. Just to the west of High Force you can visit Cow Green Reservoir and Cauldron Snout Waterfall .",
