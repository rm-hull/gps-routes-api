It said at that time if you put a bucket in the beck for water there would be a salmon in it."

  "description": "Enjoy rivers, brooks, woodland and beautiful countryside on this circular walk in the Forest of Bowland AONB. The Trough of Bowland is a particularly scenic area of the AONB with its gorgeous valleys, moorland and wooded areas. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for including buzzards and oyster catchers. This walk starts in the pretty village of Dunsop Bridge and follows a waterside footpath along the River Dunsop to Calder Moor and Whin Fell. At Brennand Farm you turn south towards Rams Clough where you pick up a country lane which runs along the Losterdale Brook and the Langden Brook to Dunsop Bridge. This long waterside stretch is particularly lovely with little waterfalls and other small brooks to enjoy. See the street view link below to get a good idea of what to expect on this section. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the long distance Forest of Bowland Walk and visit the pretty Stocks Reservoir . You could also try our Dunsop Bridge Circular Walk which starts from the village. It will take you through the lovely Langden Valley to Bleasdale water before climbing to Totridge Fell. The nearby Inn at Whitewell is a great place to use as a base to explore the area.",
