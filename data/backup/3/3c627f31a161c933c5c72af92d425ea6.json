  "description": "The Dirleton Solar Walk is a unique and educational experience situated along a 1.2 km stretch of the John Muir Way, connecting Dirleton village to the Archerfield Walled Garden. This installation is a 1:3.6 billion scale model of the Solar System, offering an interactive and accessible way to explore the vastness of space. Each planet is represented by a scaled installation along the route, complete with informational plaques and QR codes for further learning or augmented reality experiences. Designed with the collaboration of local students, universities, and artists, the walk blends scientific discovery with the scenic beauty of East Lothian. The trail is both walkable and wheelable, providing an inclusive and family-friendly outing. Starting at Dirleton allows you to encounter the Sun and inner planets first, while the journey from Archerfield begins with the outer planets. Along the way, you'll enjoy the idyllic surroundings of Dirleton's village green and the landscaped Archerfield estate, creating a balance of education and natural tranquillity. You can continue your walking in the area by picking up the Dunbar to North Berwick Walk or visiting the historic Tantallon Castle. The delightful Seacliff Beach is also nearby.",
