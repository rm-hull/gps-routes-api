  "description": "This walk visits the village of Denby Dale in West Yorkshire. It makes use of waymarked trails to create a circular walk through the surrounding countryside. On the way there's nice views of the River Dearne and Denby Viaduct, open countryside, woodland trails and some small hill climbs with great views from the high points. The walk starts from Denby Dale railway station, located just to the east of the village. The station lies on the\u00a0Penistone Line\u00a09.5 miles (15\u00a0km) south east of\u00a0Huddersfield. From here you can pick up a footpath heading south east that will link you up with the Kirklees Way long distance trail. This will lead you east to Dobroyd Hill and Upper Bagden before following woodland trails through Bagden Wood. The route then turns west past Bagden Hall and Bagden Park golf club, passing along the Dearne Way for a while. Around Kitchenroyd you turn north and then west to follow the Kirklees Way into the village of Lower Cumberworth. Trails will then take you south east to Denby Dale, before returning to the train station where the walk finishes. There's some other nice options in the area if you'd like to continue your walking. Scout Dike, Royd Moor and Ingbirchworth Reservoirs are located a couple of miles south of the village. There's nice waterside trails to follow alongside this trio of lakes. The smaller Broadstone Reservoir is located just west as well. Just to the south east there's some nice woodland trails in Deffer Wood and the pretty Cannon Hall Country Park near Cawthorne.",
