This is one of the more easily accessible of the rock art sites in the county, being just a short walk from the road."

  "description": "Enjoy a walk from the village of Ford to this beautiful hidden gem in Northumberland. The walk starts at the remains of Ford castle and heads east into some beautiful countryside. You pass the Ford Moss Nature Reserve where you can see birds such as red grouse, meadow pipit and woodcock. You can also see reptiles such as common lizards and adders. You continue from the reserve towards Goatscrag Hill before coming to the beautiful waterfall on the Broomridgedean Burn. Return to Ford on the same path. Ford is located just a few miles north of the popular walking town of Wooler. Here you can extend your walking in the area by visting Wooler Common or climbing Humbleton Hill .",
