  "description": "Enjoy a short walk through the pretty Maidenhead Thicket located on the western outskirts of the town. There are miles of woodland walking trails with snowdrops, common spotted orchids and other wildflowers to see. You'll also visit the earth-banks and ditches of Robin Hood\u2019s Arbour, a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The glade was used by outlaws who used the woods as a hideaway. The area attracts a variety of wildlife including butterflies, dragonflies and wetland birds. To continue your walking around Maidenhead pick up the Thames Path national trail and enjoy a riverside walk to Marlow. The Chiltern Way also skirts the northern edge of the thicket.",
