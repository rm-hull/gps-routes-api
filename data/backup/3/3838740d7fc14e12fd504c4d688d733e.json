  "description": "Enjoy a short walk through the pretty Maidenhead Thicket located on the western outskirts of the town. There are miles of woodland walking trails with snowdrops, common spotted orchids and other wildflowers to see. You'll also visit the earth-banks and ditches of Robin Hood\u2019s Arbour, a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The glade was used by outlaws who used the woods as a hideaway. The area attracts a variety of wildlife including butterflies, dragonflies and wetland birds. To continue your walking around Maidenhead pick up the Thames Path national trail and enjoy a riverside walk to Marlow. The Chiltern Way also skirts the northern edge of the thicket.",

      "content": "The circular Maidenhead Boundary Walk runs through the thicket. The 13 mile trail is a nice way to explore the area around the town. The circular Bourne End Walk visits the town. You could visit the neighbouring settlement which includes the National Trust's Cock Marsh and an excellent riverside pub in the shape of The Bounty. Just to the west in Hurley you can pick up the Hurley Loop Walk which will take you south to the woodland trails in Ashley Hill Forest and the Hurley Chalk Pit Nature Reserve. The Knowl Hill Bridleway can be picked up on the western end of the common. The circular cycling and walking route explores the area around Knowl Hill, with some fine views from the high points. Just to the east of Marlow is the neighbouring village of Little Marlow. Here you can explore the wildlife rich Spade Oak Nature Reserve and visit the historic 14th century church and 16th century pub.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Berkshire Walks page."
