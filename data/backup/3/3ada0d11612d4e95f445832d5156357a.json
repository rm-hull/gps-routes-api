The reservoir, now owned by Dwr Cymru/Welsh Water, also supplies Conwy and Deganwy as well as the aluminium works at Dolgarrog."

    "description": "Visit the deepest lake in north Wales on this walk in the Carneddau range. The walk starts from the car park at Capel Curig and follows a footpath north to the reservoir. This section passes along the Afon Llugwy before climbing to the lake which is positioned 1,164 feet (355 m) above sea level. There are great views over the Ogwen Valley. The trail then runs along the lake with splendid views over the water towards the surrounding mountains of Tryfan, Y Garn, Foel Goch and Pen-Yr-Ole-Wen. It's a good footpath which runs for about 2 miles along the north-western shore of the lake. Other walk highlights include views of the pretty Afon Ddu stream which flows from the lake, and views of the 45ft (14m) high dam at the north-eastern end of the water. The walk can be extended by continuing to the nearby Llyn Eigiau or the stunning Llyn Crafnant . There's a great circular trail around the lake and a delightful lakeside cafe to visit here. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then the climb to Moel Siabod starts just a mile south east from the start point of this walk. You could also visit Llynnau Mymbyr for more waterside walking.",
