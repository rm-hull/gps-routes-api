  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir near Great Harwood. It's a lovely peaceful spot with easy trails and lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. There's also some nice countryside and woodland footpaths surrounding the water. On the way look out for Pendle Hill which makes a splendid backdrop to the walk. The trail runs for just over 2 miles with a couple of small climbs on the way. To continue your walking in the area, head south to Rishton where you can pick up the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal .",
