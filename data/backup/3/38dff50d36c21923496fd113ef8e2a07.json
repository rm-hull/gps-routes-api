  "description": "This is a riverside walk along the River Frome from its source at Evershot to Dorchester. Once complete the walk will extend to the mouth of the Frome at Poole Harbour. The trail passes through Maiden Newton, Bradford Peveril and Charminster following existing rights of way as close as possible to the Frome. There is plenty to enjoy for wildlife lovers with Kingfisher, Sandmartin, Otter, Water Vole and damselfly often sighted by the Frome.",
