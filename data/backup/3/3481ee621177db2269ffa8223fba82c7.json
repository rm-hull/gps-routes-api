  "description": "This old Cinque Port town in Kent is a fine place to start a walk. There's much to see in the historic town with several original medieval buildings including the ancient gates on the town wall, fine old pubs, almshouses and a windmill dating to 1760. This walk uses sections of the Stour Valley Walk, the White Cliffs Country Trails and the Saxon Shore Way to explore the area surrounding the town. On the way you'll visit the Sandwich Bay Nature Reserve, Royal St George's Golf Course and the Richborough Castle Roman Fort. The walk starts in the town centre, close to the train station. Here you can pick up the Stour Valley Walk and follow the waymarked footpath east along the river around Sandwich Haven. The route continues to to the coast where you will find the Sandwich Bay Nature Reserve. There's some lovely sea views and lots of wildlife to look out for around here. Head south along the beach and you will soon come to the White Cliffs Country Trail which you can follow west along Royal St George's. The famous course has been used several times for the Open Championship. After returning to the town you can head north along the river to visit Richborough Castle. This significant ancient site includes a Roman amphitheatre, huge stone walls, rolling defensive ditches and impressive foundations.",
