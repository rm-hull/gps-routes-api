Beyond the grassy area is the muddy saltmarsh and the Severn Estuary. The Severn Estuary is a Special Protection Area - European Marine Site. It has the second highest tidal range in the world at 12 metres. This tidal regime results in plant and animal communities typical of the extreme physical conditions of strong flows, mobile sediments, changing salinity, high turbidity and heavy scouring. The site is important in the spring and autumn migration periods for waders moving along the west coast of Europe, as well as in winter for large numbers of waterbirds including swans, geese, ducks and waders. These bird populations are regarded as internationally important."

  "description": "This walk takes you from Clevedon to Weston-Super-Mare using a mixture of coastal paths and country lanes. The walk starts on the coast at Clevedon where you can pick up the Poets Walk along the Bristol Channel. You continue south to Gullhouse Point along the sea wall, with fine coastal views to enjoy. You then leave the coast to follow pleasant country lanes, past the villages of Kingston Seymour, Hewish and Wick St Lawrence, crossing the River Yeo as you go. The walk then crosses the River Banwell at Ebdon before following tracks to the coast around Worlebury Hill and Weston Woods. The route then heads south of Sand Point, passing along Sand Bay before finishing in Weston on the sea front at Birnbeck Pier.",
