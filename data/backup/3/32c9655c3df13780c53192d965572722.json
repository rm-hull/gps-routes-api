  "description": "This easy walk takes you along a particularly lovely section of the Peak Forest Canal in Marple. You'll pass the Marple Lock Flight consisting of a flight of sixteen\u00a0canal locks over the course of about 1 mile. It's a splendid sight with lots of boats to see in the summer months and nice views of the surrounding countryside. The walk starts from Marple Memorial Park where there's a car park, tree sculptures, sensory gardens and nice views towards the Peak District hills. From the car park follow footpaths leading down to the canal where you can pick up the towpath and head north, passing the lock flight. The walk passes Brabyn's Park before finishing at Marple Aqueduct. The structure\u00a0was built to carry the lower level of the\u00a0Peak Forest Canal\u00a0across a length of the\u00a0River Goyt. It is the highest canal\u00a0aqueduct\u00a0in England and the highest masonry-arch aqueduct in Britain. You can extend the walk by continuing along the Etherow Goyt Valley Way which will take you west along the river towards Bredbury. Etherow Country Park is also very close by. There's more nice waterside trails along the River Etherow here. The Macclesfield Canal also starts at the locks. You can follow it south through the countryside towards Bollington and Macclesfield .",
