  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along the River Arun from Arundel to Littlehampton on this easy route in West Sussex. The walk runs for a distance of just over 5 miles on a nice, flat riverside footpath. At Littlehampton you can return on foot the same way or catch the train back to Arundel. Starting on the northern side of the river in Arundel you head west and then south toward Tortington and Ford. The village has a noteworthy Saxon church which was built in about 1040, and substantially rebuilt by the Normans with a surviving early 12th-century Norman chancel arch with carved decoration. It's located near the River Arun, and surrounded by a walled churchyard entered through a wrought iron gate. The route continues south, passing a marina before crossing the river and finishing in Littlehampton. You could head a short distance down to the coast to extend the walk. Here you can enjoy refreshments at the iconic East Beach Cafe. The Cafe has not only received acclaim for the architecture by winning a national architecture prize from the RIBA, the food is also highly regarded. It was also awarded Coastal Cafe of the Year by National Magazine Company's Coast Awards 2011. To continue your walking in the Littlehampton area head east along the coast and visit Highdown Hill and Highdown Gardens. Here you'll find lovely gardens with a beautiful collection of rare plants and trees. The chalk gardens are situated on Downland countryside with wonderful views towards the sea. In Arundel you can try the Arundel Castle and Arundel Park Walk which visits the historic castle.",

Near Arundel there's the worthy village of Burpham to visit. The delightful riverside settlement includes picturesque thatched cottages, a Grade I listed Saxon Church and a century-old cricket pitch where W. G. Grace played.
