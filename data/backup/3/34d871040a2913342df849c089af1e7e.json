  "description": "This route follows the circular cycling and walking trail around Carsington Water in Ashbourne, Derbyshire. The trail starts at the excellent visitor centre where cycle hire is available. It includes long shoreline sections and several woodland sections with great views of the surrounding countryside. The route runs for just over 7 miles on a fairly flat path so it's suitable for most abilities. The lake is also a great place for birdwatching. Look out for little owl, little grebe, great northern diver, Eurasian oystercatcher, common tern and breeding common redshank. If you enjoy this route then you could head to the nearby Ogston Reservoir where there are more fantastic bird watching opportunities. The Pennine Bridleway and Midshires Way long distance trails run just to the north of the site. You can pick up these trails to extend your walking around Wirksworth. The town is a good base for walkers with the High Peak Trail and the Black Rocks near Cromford to visit. Just to the north of the site you will find Middleton Top. There's an excellent visitor centre here and fine views back down to the reservoir from the hill top.",
