  "description": "This route follows the circular cycling and walking trail around Carsington Water in Ashbourne, Derbyshire. The trail starts at the excellent visitor centre where cycle hire is available. It includes long shoreline sections and several woodland sections with great views of the surrounding countryside. The route runs for just over 7 miles on a fairly flat path so it's suitable for most abilities. The lake is also a great place for birdwatching. Look out for little owl, little grebe, great northern diver, Eurasian oystercatcher, common tern and breeding common redshank. If you enjoy this route then you could head to the nearby Ogston Reservoir where there are more fantastic bird watching opportunities. The Pennine Bridleway and Midshires Way long distance trails run just to the north of the site. You can pick up these trails to extend your walking around Wirksworth. The town is a good base for walkers with the High Peak Trail and the Black Rocks near Cromford to visit. Just to the north of the site you will find Middleton Top. There's an excellent visitor centre here and fine views back down to the reservoir from the hill top.",

There's a great menu and fine views over the water from here. Head a couple of miles north and you could visit the noteworthy Olde Gate Inn in Brassington village. The historic inn dates back to the 17th century and is Grade II listed. Bonnie Prince Charlie\u2019s soldiers were billeted at the inn on their march to London, and some of the oak beams came from ships of the Spanish Armada. It's been named Britain\u2019s cosiest pub by The Times with its charming interior and roaring fires. Outside there's a lovely large garden area with fine views. They serve high quality gastro food and have a good selection of ales. You can find them on Well Street with a postcode of DE4 4HJ\u200b for your sat navs."

The historic village is well worth a visit, with several centuries old limestone cottages, a church dating from the Norman period and a notable Tudor house built in 1615. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
