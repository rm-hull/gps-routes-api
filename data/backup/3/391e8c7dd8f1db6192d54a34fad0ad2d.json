  "description": "This walk takes you to Mam Tor from the village of Hope in the Peak District National Park. It's about a 4 mile walk to the peak from the village centre, so 8 miles there and back. Starting from Hope you head west along Peakshole Water to Castleton before climbing up onto the wonderful ridge, via Dunscar Farm. You will eventually reach Hollins Cross, the lowest point on the ridge. From here you turn south west to climb up to Mam Tor. The popular hill stands at a height of 517 m (1,696 ft), commanding wonderful views over the Peak District. The area is also geologically significant with Mam Tor consisting of 320 million year old Carboniferous rocks. After taking in the views the route descends back to Castleton and Hope on the same paths. For alternative routes to the summit you could try the Mam Tor from Edale Walk or our Mam Tor Circular Walk. You could also walk the fall length of the stunning ridge on the Ridge Walk Mam Tor to Lose Hill route.",
