  "description": "This circular walk explores a wonderful limestone gorge near Wookey Hole. In the gorge you will find waymarked woodland trails and a variety of interesting plants and flowers. There's also pretty streams and lots of interesting rock formations. There is some climbing involved with some of the paths reaching a height of over 700ft. From these high points at the top of the gorge there are great views towards Glastonbury and the Somerset Levels. The area is also a designated nature reserve so look out for wildlife including red deer and birds of prey. The site also attracts a large variety of butterflies including white-letter hairstreak, high brown fritillary and chalkhill blue. Flora includes bluebells, wood anemone, ancient woodland and various fungi\u00a0and\u00a0ferns. There is a good sized car park just off the Deerleap Road where you can start your walk. You could also follow the West Mendip Way from the nearby town of Wells to the site. It's about a two mile walk, passing Wookey Hole on the way. The West Mendip Way passes through the area so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Heading north will take you to the village of Priddy through the countryside. A couple of miles beyond Priddy you will find Rodney Stoke and Draycott Sleights Nature Reserves where there are nice footpaths and lots of flora and fauna to look out for.",
