  "description": "This pretty village is located in the Vale of White Horse in Oxfordshire, just to the east of Wantage. There's nice walks through the countryside of the North Wessex Downs and along the nearby The Ridgeway National Trail. Noteworthy buildings in the village include the 13th century chuch and the 18th century Ardington House which is Grade II listed. The fine Georgian stately home is surrounded by beautiful parkland and gardens. It is open to the public in the summer months. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring settlements of East Lockinge and East Hendred. The walk starts in the village and heads south across the Ardington Brook to Ardington Mill. You then follow footpaths and a country lane to East Lockinge. The route then picks up a bridle track heading east to Aldfield Common and East Hendred. On the way you'll pass some attractive countryside and cross the pretty Ginge Brook. You then head west past Goldbury Hill and West Hendred before returning to the village.",
