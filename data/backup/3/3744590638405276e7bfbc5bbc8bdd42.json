  "description": "This expansive area of woodland near Omagh includes miles of good footpaths and mountain bike trails. For walkers there's a series of colour coded waymarked paths to try from the main car park. Cyclists can enjoy moderate blue trails and more challenging red trails. On the way there are streams, waterfalls, lots of wildlife and some fine views towards the nearby Sperrin Mountains. Look out for fauna including deer and various woodland birds. To continue your walking in the Sperrins area head east to visit Davagh Forest. There's nice river walks and an exhilarating red graded mountain bike trail to try here.",

Further north there's the Banagher Glen Nature Reserve. Here you can explore the Banagher Dam and a series of pretty waterfalls with red squirrels to look out for on the way. To the south east there's Loughmacrory Lough. Here you will find a 2km circular trail running along the shoreline of the pretty lake. Just to the east there's the lovely Ballinderry River Walk in nearby Dunnamore. Near here you can pick up the circular loop walk around An Creagan. There's a visitor centre, a boardwalk over the Creggan Bog Nature Reserve and woodland trails to be found in this interesting area."
