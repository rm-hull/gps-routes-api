  "description": "Follow the Bury to Clare Walk from Bury St Edmunds to Clare on this walk through Suffolk. The path starts at Nowton Park in Bury St Edmunds and heads south passing Somerton, Hawkedon and Stansfield before finishing at Clare Castle Country Park where there are the ruins of the historic Clare Castle. The route runs for a distance of about 19 miles with some small climbs on the way. As such it's possible to complete the walk in a day. Along the way there's a number of pretty little villages, lovely Suffolk countryside and views of the River Stour at the end of the walk in Clare.",

Despite its size there's a number of unusual items inside including a mummified cat, currency notes on the ceiling, historical photos, military items and an aeroplane propeller. As such the Victorian pub is a local tourist attraction and well worthy of some investigation. You can find them at 17 The Traverse, with a postcode of IP33 1BJ for your sat navs."
