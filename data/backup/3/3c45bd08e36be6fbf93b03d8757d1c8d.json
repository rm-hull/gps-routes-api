  "description": "This circular walk climbs Ben Bhraggie hill in Golspie. The hill stands at a height of 397 metres (1,302 ft) giving fabulous views over Sutherland. At the summit you will find the Sutherland monument. The 100ft statue represents George Leveson-Gower, the first Duke of Sutherland. He remains a controversial figure for the part he played in the Highland Clearances where thousands of Sutherland tenants were forced out of their homes in the early 19th century. The walk begins in the pretty village of Golspie on the North Sea coast. You then follow waymarked paths through forest and over heather moorland to the summit. You descend to Golspie on more woodland trails through Ben Bhraggie Wood. The area is also fantastic for mountain biking with a wildcat trail billed as the longest freeride descent in the UK.",

      "content": "Head west towards Lairg and you could visit another local highlight at the Falls of Shin. The beautiful falls are a great place to see salmon leaping during the late summer months. There's also a decent visitor centre, car park and cafe at the site. Near here you can also visit the impressive Loch Shin Hydro Dam in Lairg itself. Also near the coast at Brora is Loch Brora where there's another peaceful waterside trail to try. A few miles to the west you'll find the splendid Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve. The coastal reserve includes sand dunes and nature trails with seals, otters and various wildfowl to look out for on the way. The John O' Groats trail runs from Brora to Golspie with some splendid views over the Moray Firth. Here you could also visit the historic Dunrobin Castle. The 14th century castle has a fascinating history and some beautiful gardens to explore. The lovely waterfalls on the Golspie Big Burn Walk can also be found just to the south east of the hill. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
