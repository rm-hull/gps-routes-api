  "description": "Follow the lovely nature trail in this RSPB reserve by Loch Lomond on this short walk. The route starts at the  Inversnaid Hotel and follows the West Highland Way along the loch before climbing to oak woodland and open moorland where there are fabulous views. Look out for pied flycatchers, buzzards and woodpeckers on the way. If you would like to extend your walk you could continue along the West Highland Way in either direction. You could also visit the beautiful Inversnaid Falls which are a short stroll from the start of this route.",
