  "description": "This Buckinghamshire based village is located in a pleasant rural spot in the Chiltern Hills,\u00a0on the border with\u00a0Oxfordshire. The neighbouring village of Stokenchurch lies just a few miles to the north. This walk from the village takes you north to visit the Aston Rowant Nature Reserve and climb to the viewpoint at Beacon Hill in the Chilterns. On the way you will pass along the old Wormsley Estate and visit Ibstone Common. There's lots of peaceful woodland trails, countryside paths, wildlife and some excellent views from the high points. The Wormsley Estate is private but is open on certain days for special events. It is well known for its cricket ground and a good place to look out for red kites. Public footpaths skirts the eastern edge of the estate. To continue your walking around the village head south to nearby Turville where you can pay a visit to the famous Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Windmill .",
