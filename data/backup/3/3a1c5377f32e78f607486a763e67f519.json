  "description": "This walk takes you through the beautiful Woburn Park in Befordshire. The park includes tranquil ponds, pretty Orchards, a 3000 acre deer park and the magnificent Woburn Safari Park with its White Rhino, Elephants, Tigers and Black Bears. There's also the splendid Woburn Abbey - a stunning country house which is the seat of the Duke of Bedford. The walk starts in Woburn village where parking is available. Then pick up public footpaths heading east before turning south and following the Greensand Ridge Walk across the splendid deer park towards Brook End where you can enjoy a bite to eat in the cafe. This walk returns to the car park the same way but you can turn it into a longer circular walk by heading south east from Linden Lake to Milton Wood. Other trails will then take you north west past the Hopgarden Ponds and back to the abbey and Woburn village. You can extend your walk by following the Greensand Ridge Walk west to Bow Brickhill Woods and Aspley Woods where there's miles of woodland trails and an excellent red grade mountain bike route. Here you can also pick up the Milton Keynes Boundary Walk and explore the area further.",
