The woodland is important for a range of lichens and mosses as well as the native birch and oak. The picture shows a typical view of the site with a group of children in the distance collecting acorns for Wild Ennerdale"

  "description": "This is a fairly easy climb to Latterbarrow Hill in the Lake District. The hill reaches a height of 803 feet (245 m) with splendid views over Esthwaite Water and Lake Windermere. This circular walk starts in Hawkshead, following country lanes and footpaths to the hill summit where you will find a stone monument. There's also splendid views of a number of fells including the Fairfield Horseshoe and Red Screes. The walk then descends through the woodland on Claife Heights, passing a number of tarns on the way. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Wray Castle or explore the tarns and woodland of Claife Heights .",
