  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the Cumbrian village of Nenthead. It's a significant location as one of England's highest villages and the home of the historic Nenthead Mines. The settlement is located close to Alston and Garrigill in the North Pennines. The walk starts from the Nenthead Mines Heritage Centre where car parking is available. At the centre you can learn all about the lead and zinc mining history of the North Pennines. There's also mine entrances, dumps, old buildings and some rare plants growing on the metal-rich mine dumps. The route then heads south past the old mines to the picturesque Perry's Dam. From here you turn west to follow footpaths past Flinty Fell to visit another local highlight at Ashgill Force Waterfall. At the falls you pick up the South Tyne Trail and follow it north along the River South Tyne to the village of Garrigil. The final section follows a country lane east past Nunnery Hill to return to Nenthead.",
