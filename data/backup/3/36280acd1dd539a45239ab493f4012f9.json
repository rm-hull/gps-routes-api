  "description": "This area of common land near Pocklington has some nice tracks to follow through the attractive pine woodland. The woods are popular with dog walkers with miles of flat tracks to try. You can start your walk from the car park on Common Lane on the western side of the woods. Then pick up the nice wide trails heading east. Look out for wildlife including the elusive adder and various woodland birds. The common is located just to the west of the villages of Allerthorpe and Barmby Moor. Also nearby is Pocklington where you can extend your walking along the Pocklington Canal and the Wilberforce Way long distance trail. The trail runs from Hull to York and was created in memory of William Wilberforce the Slave abolitionist. The Yorkshire Wolds Way also runs just to the east of Pocklington and is another good option for extending your walk.",
