  "description": "This area of common land near Pocklington has some nice tracks to follow through the attractive pine woodland. The woods are popular with dog walkers with miles of flat tracks to try. You can start your walk from the car park on Common Lane on the western side of the woods. Then pick up the nice wide trails heading east. Look out for wildlife including the elusive adder and various woodland birds. The common is located just to the west of the villages of Allerthorpe and Barmby Moor. Also nearby is Pocklington where you can extend your walking along the Pocklington Canal and the Wilberforce Way long distance trail. The trail runs from Hull to York and was created in memory of William Wilberforce the Slave abolitionist. The Yorkshire Wolds Way also runs just to the east of Pocklington and is another good option for extending your walk.",

      "content": "In Pocklington we recommend a visit to the very pretty Burnby Hall Gardens. It's a lovely place for an afternoon stroll with landscaped gardens and two lakes. The park is notable for over 100 types of water lilies displayed in the lakes where you can also feed the fish. There's also an ornamental bridge, a Victorian Garden, an Aviary Garden, a newly restored Edwardian Rock Garden, a Stumpery, and a Birch Walk, the latter being the most recent horticultural addition. You can find out about the history of the area in the Stewart Museum. It houses a fascinating collection of artefacts collected by Major Stewart on eight world tours that were undertaken between 1906 and 1926, several of which have been deemed by UNESCO as being of national and international importance. Afterwards visit the cafe where you can enjoy refreshments with a view. You can find the park in the town centre with a postcode of YO42 2QF for your sat navs.  Burnby Hall - Victorian Gardens and Dragonfly Pond"
