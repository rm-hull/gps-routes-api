  "description": "This picture postcard village sits in a delightful spot in the Chess Valley in Hertfordshire. It's a popular place for a walk with a pretty village green, quaint old cottages, a pond and waterside trails along the scenic river at the bottom of the settlement. This circular walk from the village visits the River Chess and Chenies Manor. The walk starts in the village and heads south west along country lanes to Sarratt Bottom by the river. Here you can pick up the Chess Valley Walk and follow the waymarked trail west towards Chenies. There's another pretty village here and a historic Tudor House. The photogenic building is Grade I listed and surrounded by award-winning gardens. Original 13th Century features including a Medieval well, a dungeon and a reputed priest hole. You can tour the house and garden for a fee, from April to October. The route then heads east past Mount Wood to Nicholas Spring and Sarrat Mill House on the river. Here you cross over the water to Church End before following a country lane back into the village.",
