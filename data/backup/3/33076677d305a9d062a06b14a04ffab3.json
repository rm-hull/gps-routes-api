  "description": "Follow the Beeches Way through the Chilterns from the River Thames at Cookham to the Grand Union Canal at West Drayton. You start off at Cookham and head east to the wooded Burnham Beeches Nature Reserve. The reserve covers over 500 acres with a network of great woodland trails. There's also ponds, grassland, heathland with wildlife which includes Exmoor Ponies. The walk then passes through Fulmer before a lovely stretch through Black Park Country Park and Langley Park Country Park .  The final stretch takes you around the lakes in Colne Valley Regional Park before finishing on the Grand Union Canal at West Drayton.",
