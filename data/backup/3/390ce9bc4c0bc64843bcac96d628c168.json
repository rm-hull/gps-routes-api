  "description": "This delightul Buckinghamshire village has some nice country and river walking trails to try. There's also a picturesque village green and a couple of fine old pubs for refreshments afterwards. The church is also noteworthy, dating back to the 13th century it includes some amazing wall paintings. This circular walk from the village takes you to the nearby Shardeloes Lake before visiting the neighbouring village of Holmer Green. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the South Bucks Way and follow the waymarked footpath east to Shardeloes where there's pretty lakes and views of the River Misbourne. The route then follows a public footpath south west toward Mop End where there are some nice trails through the bluebell woods. From here you head west past Beamond End to the village of Holmer Green. From here you follow Kingstreet Lane north to meet up with the South Bucks Way at Suffolk Bridge. Head east from here and you will soon come back to Little Missenden.",

It's a pub of some note having been named \u2018Best Country Pub\u2019 in the Good Pub Guide 2019 edition. It has some history too, having been turned into a pub in 1800. They serve high quality food which you can enjoy in the lovely garden area during the warmer months. You can find them at Highmore Cottages, HP7 0RF."
