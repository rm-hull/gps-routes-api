  "description": "This walk visits the Dunbear, a giant sculpture above Dunbar in East Lothian. The 5 metre high bear sculpture celebrates the life of the locally born John Muir known as the father of national parks. Muir was a key person involved in implementing National Parks in the USA. You can park at the Asda/Garden Centre and then follow a winding surfaced footpath up to the bear sculpture. The sculpture is the work of Andy Scott, a Scottish sculptor whose other public artworks include Kelpies in Falkirk and the Beacon of Hope in Belfast. From the top there are some lovely views over the surrounding fields. To continue your walking you could pick up the long distance John Muir Way and visit the nearby John Muir Country Park and Tyninghame Beach .",
