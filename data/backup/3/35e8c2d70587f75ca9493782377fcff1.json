Impressive as this building is, the original plan was for a 'double-fronted' mill, twice the size of what exists; the main tower would have been in the centre of the facade. The building is fully occupied and is in generally very good order."

  "description": "These two parks sit side by side near Stockport town centre. They have nice walking trails along the River Goyt, woodland trails, ponds with wildlife and well laid out gardens. From the high points in the park there are nice views towards the Peak District hills. The Midshires Way and the Etherow Goyt Valley Way both run through the park so you can pick these up to extend your walking in the area. Just to the north there's more nice trails around Reddish Vale Country Park, Haughton Dale Nature Reserve and Highfield Country Park .",
