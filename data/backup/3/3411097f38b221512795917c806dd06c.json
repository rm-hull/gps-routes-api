  "description": "This Staffordshire based village lies just to the south of Codsall and west of Wolverhampton. This circular walk explores the village before heading into the countryside to the west of the settlement. The walk starts off at the lake in the centre of the village where you can pick up a shared cycling and walking trail running along the River Penk from the upper lake to the lower lake. It's a nice area for a stroll with lots of birds to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for tufted duck, mute swan, Canada goose, coot, moorhen, grey wagtail, grey heron and kingfisher as you make your way along the path. The walk then heads into the countryside where you can pick up a section of the Staffordshire Way long distance footpath. The trails will take you around Wrottesley Park where there are views of the Grade II listed Wrottesley Hall. It's a lovely area for a walk with attractive trees and blossoms during the spring months. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit the National Trust's Wightwick Manor. The Victorian Manor house includes lovely gardens with orchards, pools, formal gardens, a Victorian kitchen garden and a mathematical bridge. You can also enjoy waterside walks along the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and visit the wildlife rich Smestow Valley Local Nature Reserve in this area.",
