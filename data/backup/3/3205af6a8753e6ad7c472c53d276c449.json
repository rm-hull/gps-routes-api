  "description": "Enjoy a series of waymarked walking trails in this woodland area near Shrewsbury. There are four colour coded trails of varying lengths and difficulty. The Bardon Geo Trail is waymarked with orange markers. It will take you to a viewpoint with wonderful views over the Shropshire countryside and the River Severn. The red waymakers will take you on Henry's Hike where you can enjoy excellent views of The Wrekin. Wilfred's Walk follows blue markers on a four km circular tour of the area. It is named after Wilfred Owen the famous World War One poet who had links with the area. There is also an easy access trail suitable for wheelchairs and buggies which is waymarked with yellow markers. You will pass through mixed deciduous/coniferous woodland and visit an Iron Age enclosure and Haughmond quarry on the way. Look out for deer as you make your way through the woodland areas. Parking is available on site but you could easily reach the forest by following the Shropshire Way along the River Severn from Shrewsbury if you wanted to come by foot. If you wanted to continue your walk you could visit the ruins of the nearby Haughmond Abbey and Haughmond Abbey Woods. You could also pick up the Severn Way and enjoy some riverside walking. The path of the old Shrewsbury Canal also finishes at Uffington next to the hill. You can pick this up to enjoy an easy cycle or walk into Shrewsbury town centre.",
