  "description": "Tarporley is a very pretty Cheshire village with some nice country trails and waterside walks along the nearby canal towpath. This circular walk from the village heads south to some of the walking highlights of the area. On the route you'll visit the historic Beeston Castle before a waterside stroll along the Shropshire Union Canal. The route starts in the village and picks up public footpaths heading west to meet with the Sandstone Trail. You can follow this waymarked trail south to Wharton's Bridge on the canal. From here you head south to pay a visit to Beeston Castle. You can explore the ruins of the 13th century castle and enjoy wonderful views to the Peckforton Hills and the Cheshire Plain. After exploring the castle you head north and return to the canal at Wharton's Lock. Here you pick up the towpath and head east to Beeston Lock and Tilstone Lock. The route then leaves the canal and heads north towards Tilstone Hall where you turn north west to follow country lanes back to Tarporley.",

There's some nice trails taking you to woodland, lowland heath and ponds here. If you head north along the Sandstone Trail it will take you to the expansive Delamere Forest where there are miles of walking and cycling trails to try. Head south west and you will find the neighbouring village of Tattenhall. Here you can visit the noteworthy Ice Cream Farm, the largest ice cream shop in the world. The popular tourist attraction includes expansive children's play areas, farm animals and quad bikes. You can find them at Drumlan Hall, Newton Ln, CH3 9NE. Bunbury locks and the associated village of Bunbury are located just to the south. The impressive staircase locks on the Shropshire Union Canal and the delightful historic settlement are well worth a visit. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
