  "description": "Enjoy a super cycle or walk in this 3000 acre deer park near Wells-Next-The-Sea on the Norfolk coast. National Cycle Network Route 1 passes straight through the centre of the park taking you past the large lake, the Obelisk, the beautiful 18th century mansion and back through peaceful woodland. There are also a number of waymarked walking trails including a lakeside trail and a nature trail with 28 information boards explaining interesting facts about the flora and fauna in the Park. This includes a large herd of Fallow Deer, a smaller herd of Red Deer, Barn Owls and the evergreen oaks imported from Italy. The park is located close to the town of Wells-Next-the-Sea so you could start the walk from there if you prefer. It's about a 4.5 mile walk from the town harbour, following a lovely section of the Norfolk Coast Path through Holkham Meals. See the Wells to Holkham Walk for more details.",

      "content": "The circular Burnham Market Walk starts in the nearby village and visits the Holkham Park and the nature reserve before heading to the noteworthy village of Burnham Thorpe. The village is notable as the the birthplace of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson, victor at the Battle of Trafalgar. There is a bronze plaque on the wall here which is a nice piece of history to witness in the area. Nelson's father Edmund was also rector of Burnham Market's churches during the 1760s and 1770s. In the village you can enjoy a visit to The Nelson pub which dates all the way back to 1685. Head south east Great Walsingham and you could pick up the Walsingham Way. This long distance trail runs from the mediaeval abbey at Great Walsingham to the city of Norwich, passing several fascinating historic sites on the way. The abbey in Walsingham is one of the highlights of the area and not too far from the park. There's some lovely grounds with the snowdrop and bluebell walks particularly popular. The long distance Rebellion Way Cycle Route passes through the park. The epic 232 mile circular ride visits some of the major highlights of Norfolk, using a series of quiet country lanes and traffic free paths. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Walks page."
