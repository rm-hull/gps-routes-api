    "description": "Enjoy a super cycle or walk in this 3000 acre deer park near Wells-Next-The-Sea on the Norfolk coast. National Cycle Network Route 1 passes straight through the centre of the park taking you past the large lake, the Obelisk, the beautiful 18th century mansion and back through peaceful woodland. There are also a number of waymarked walking trails including a lakeside trail and a nature trail with 28 information boards explaining interesting facts about the flora and fauna in the Park. This includes a large herd of Fallow Deer, a smaller herd of Red Deer, Barn Owls and the evergreen oaks imported from Italy. The park is located close to the town of Wells-Next-the-Sea so you could start the walk from there if you prefer. It's about a 4.5 mile walk from the town harbour, following a lovely section of the Norfolk Coast Path through Holkham Meals. See the Wells to Holkham Walk for more details.",
