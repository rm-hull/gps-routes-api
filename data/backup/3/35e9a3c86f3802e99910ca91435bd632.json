    "description": "This Ceredigion based town sits at the confluence of the Rivers Dulas Teifi. It's surrounded by plenty of footpaths on which to explore the beautiful Teifi Valley. It also includes a campus of the University of Wales making it the smallest university town in the UK. This walk from the town takes you up to the viewpoint at Bryn Mawr to the south of Lampeter. From here you can enjoy splendid views over the countryside of the Teifi Valley. The walk starts in the town next to the River Dulas and follows a footpath south along the water. You then cross the Teifi on Pont Stephen before following country lanes east and then south east up to Bry Mawr. Here you reach a height of over 300 metres with excellent views over the fields to the town below. After taking in the views the route returns to the town on the same footpaths.",
