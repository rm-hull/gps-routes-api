  "description": "This former slate quarrying village sits in a dramatic location on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park in the valley of the River Ogwen. This circular walk explores the old Penrhyn Quarries. The quarries are located just to the south of the village and include some fine views over the village from the high points. It's a photogenic area with the dramatic steep quarry faces and unusually coloured lakes formed from old gravel pits. The quarry is of some historical significance as at the end of the nineteenth century it was the world's largest slate quarry. On the walk there are also some nice riverside trails along the River Ogwen which runs through the area. The quarry is home to Zip World where you can enjoy an exhilarating ride on the fastest zip line in the world. Here you can fly 500m above the bright blue quarry lake and learn all about the history of the quarry on the Penrhyn Quarry Tour. You can extend the walk by picking up the Snowdonia Slate Trail . This circular long distance trail takes you through the Snowdonia National Park visiting more of the heritage mining sites in the area. Follow the trail south for a few miles would take you to Padarn Country Park where you can explore the Dinorwic Quarry and climb the splendid zig zag path at Llyn Peris .",
