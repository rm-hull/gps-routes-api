  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll through Royden Park and Thurstaston Common on this lovely walk in the Wirral. There are many trails taking you past deciduous and conifer woodlands, meadows, heathland and the two meres where you will find an abundance of birdlife. There is also an excellent miniature railway which is very popular in the holidays. You can also climb Thurstaston Hill where there are fabulous views of the River Dee estuary. The hill is also the location of Thor's Stone, a large sandstone outcrop. It is thought that early Viking settlers held religious ceremonies on the site. Less than a mile west of the park you will find the lovely Caldy Hill. This large area of heathland and woodland is a great place to extend your walking. Also nearby is the splendid Wirral Country Park and the long distance Wirral Way. Our longer Thurstaston Common and Coast Walk starts from the car park and will take you to the country park and the coast.",

      "content": "There's good facilities with a visitor centre and on site cafe where you can enjoy refreshments after your exercise. If you fancy a pub lunch you could head into nearby Irby and visit the historic Irby Mill. The pub is set in the old miller's cottage for the mill that once stood on this site. After being disused since about 1878 and in a very dilapidated condition, the mill was demolished in 1898. The pub has a charming interior with thick sandstone walls, low beams and a real fire. There's a small L-shaped, stone-floored bar and a lounge used mainly by diners. They serve good quality locally sourced home-made food and have a nice garden area for warmer days. You can find the pub at postcode CH49 3NT for your sat navs. They are dog friendly."

      "content": "Just a couple of miles to the south there's another of the walking highlights of the area at Heswall Dales. The pleasant area of heathland has some interesting wildlife, fascinating geological features and fine coastal views. Near here you can pick up the Parkgate Circular Walk and explore the area around the delightful village of Parkgate. There's another nature reserve here with marshland, lots of wildlife and a fine coastal pub to relax in afterwards. Neston with its splendid botanical gardens is also located in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Merseyside Walks and the Wirral Walks pages."
