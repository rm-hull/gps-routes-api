  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll through Royden Park and Thurstaston Common on this lovely walk in the Wirral. There are many trails taking you past deciduous and conifer woodlands, meadows, heathland and the two meres where you will find an abundance of birdlife.  There is also an excellent miniature railway which is very popular in the holidays. You can also climb Thurstaston Hill where there are fabulous views of the River Dee estuary. The hill is also the location of Thor's Stone, a large sandstone outcrop. It is thought that early Viking settlers held religious ceremonies on the site. Less than a mile west of the park you will find the lovely Caldy Hill . This large area of heathland and woodland is a great place to extend your walking. Also nearby is the splendid Wirral Country Park and the long distance Wirral Way . Our longer Thurstaston Common and Coast Walk starts from the car park and will take you to the country park and the coast.",
