  "description": "This small Gloucestershire town has some nice local river and canalside trails to try. It's also close to the wonderful Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which is a walkers paradise. The town is also notable for its historic castle and the Edward Jenner musueum, known as the birthplace of vaccination. This walk from the town visits Berkeley Castle before following the Severn Way to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Sharpness. It then follows the canal to Purton where you can enjoy refreshments and visit the unusual Purton Hulks. The route starts at the historic castle which dates back to the 12th century. The route then follows footpaths west along Berkeley Pill to Oakhunger where you pick up the Severn Way. Follow the waymarked footpath north west and it will take you down to the river. The trail then heads north along the river to the docks at Sharpness. You can then follow a waterside path along the canal before finishing at Purton where you can see the Purton Hulks. These decaying boats were deliberately beached beside the river to reinforce the river banks between 1909 and 1965.",
