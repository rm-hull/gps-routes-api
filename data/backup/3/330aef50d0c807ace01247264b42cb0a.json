  "description": "This circular walk around the town visits some of the local highlights including the River Teme and Kyrewood. The route runs for just under 4 miles through the countryside to the south of the town. There are some small climbs on the way with nice views towards the Clee Hills to enjoy. The walk starts on the western side of the town where you can follow a public footpath south along the River Teme. You'll pass Greenfields and Truecroft before turning east towards Callows Grave and Oldwood. Continue east on Saltbox Lane before turning north along Terrils Lane. Public footpaths will then take you through Kyrewood before returning to the train station.",
