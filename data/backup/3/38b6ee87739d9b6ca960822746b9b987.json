  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Moel Eilio from Llanberis in the Snowdonia National Park. It's a challenging climb with the option of continuing up to the peak of Snowdon Llanberis Path after reaching the Moel Eilio peak. Start your walk in Llanberis and head past the quarries to Bwlch y Groes. Here you can ascend to the summit on the north ridge of Moel Eilio, passing Bryn Mawr on the way. From the 726 m (2,382 ft) summit there are splendid views towards Snowdon and the surrounding mountains. After taking in the views you descend to the subsidiary summits of Foel Gron and Foel Goch. The path then descends past Cefn Drum and the Llanberis Waterfall before returning to the town. An alternative route is to start from the Snowdon Ranger Path car park and head to the summit via Foel Gron and Foel Groch. See the video below for details of this route and to give you an idea of the scenery you can expect to see on this walk. To extend your walking in the area you can climb to the Snowdon Peak on the Snowdon Llanberis Path or visit the beautiful Padarn Country Park. Here you can enjoy a lakeside stroll along Llyn Padarn and catch the Llanberis Lake Railway. There's also the splendid zig zag path at Llyn Peris to climb for great views over the lakes.",
