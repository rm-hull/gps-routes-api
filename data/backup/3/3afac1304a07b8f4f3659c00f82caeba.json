  "description": "This waymarked, long distance route explores the countryside, villages and hills surrounding the city of Derby. The route meanders through the undulating countryside of Amber Valley, Erewash Valley, and South Derbyshire, passing through 22 Civil Parishes in the rural areas around the Derby City boundary. Along the way, there are numerous industrial archaeological sites, an abundance of medieval features, and significant places of worship, all of great interest and historical significance. By using the public transport options available from the centre of Derby, walkers can choose a suitable linear section and return to the City via another service. All the footpaths and tracks are public rights-of-way and entirely within Derbyshire. The terrain is not challenging, and the walk is classified as \u2018moderate\u2019, making it particularly suitable for most active individuals and families. The walk offers opportunities for exploration and discovery for those who prefer not to commit to a full day of walking. Parts of the trail follow the former Derby Canal, as well as sections of the Trent and Mersey Canal and the River Trent. Crossings of the River Derwent occur at Duffield and Church Wilne. Villages along the \u2018Nomad Way\u2019 include Quarndon, Duffield, Little Eaton, Morley Smithy, Dale Abbey, Stanton-by-Dale, Risley, Breaston, Draycott, Shardlow, Aston-on-Trent, Weston-on-Trent, Swarkestone, Barrow-on-Trent, Findern, Etwall, Dalbury, Lees, and Langley Common. Many of these locations have regular bus services to facilitate the start or end of a chosen section. There is a variety of inns and cafes in the form of canal-side taverns, lock-keepers' cottages, old coaching inns, and tea rooms offering a wide range of refreshments. The Derby Nomad Way aims to foster an interest in protecting the countryside and encourage an appreciation of the rich natural heritage that lies less than half an hour\u2019s bus ride from Derby City centre.",
