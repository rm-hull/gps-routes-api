  "description": "This park is situated in the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) near Chepstow. It was voted the UK's favourite park in the 2011 People's Choice Green Flag Award public poll.  The station was originally opened in 1876 and closed in 1959. It now serves as a popular tourist attraction with three old carriages used as a gift shop and museum with old railway memorabilia. There is a one mile circular walk around the park with a section along the River Wye. You could follow the river further along the Wye Valley Walk if you wanted to continue your walk.",
