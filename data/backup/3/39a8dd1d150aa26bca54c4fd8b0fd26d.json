  "description": "This circular walk explores the pretty bluebell woodland around the village of Harrietsham in the Kent Downs AONB. It follows close to this charity route run by the Heart of Kent Hospice. The walk starts from the train station in the village, following footpaths north to Coles Dane. Here you can pick up a section of the Pilgrims Way and follow the waymarked trail north west towards Mile Hill. Here you turn north towards Ringlestone where you could stop for refreshments at the Ringlestone Inn. It's a pub of some note being housed in a beautiful grade II listed building dating back to 1533 and originally used as a hospice for monks. You continue south east towards Stedehill Wood where there are some peaceful woodland trails with lots of pretty bluebells to see in the spring months. The final section heads souh west past Marley Court to return to the village.",
