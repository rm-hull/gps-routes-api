  "description": "This walk climbs to Llanymynech Hill and Asterley Rocks above the village of Llanymynech in Powys, Wales. The village is a lovely place for a stroll with easy trails along the Montgomery Canal and a more challenging climb to the lovely viewpoint to the north of the settlement. It sits in a significant position right on the England/Wales border. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Offa's Dyke Path and follow the waymarked footpath north to the the Heritage area which includes the Montgomery Canal visitor centre, the Hoffmann Lime Kiln and the old quarry. Soon after you will come to Asterley Rocks and Llanymynech Hill which stands at a height of 225 metres and includes an Iron Age hillfort and a Trig Point. There's splendid views here over the surrounding hills and countryside. You can then follow paths around the hill and the adjacent golf course before returning to the village.",
