    "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Borrowdale area of the Derwent Valley in the Lake District National Park. It's a popular area for walkers with lovely scenery, riverside paths along the River Derwent and views over Derwent Water to enjoy. Start your walk from the National Trust car park at Seatoller near Seatoller Bridge. From here you can directly pick up a section of the Allerdale Ramble long distance trail. Follow the path north and it will take you past High Scawdel to Castle Crag , the smallest hill in Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. This area is very pretty with nice woodland trails and great views over the surrounding fells and lakes. The route continues around the woodland of the crag before turning south towards Rosthwaite. You enjoy a nice riverside section along the Derwent before a short woodland section returns you to Seatoller.",
