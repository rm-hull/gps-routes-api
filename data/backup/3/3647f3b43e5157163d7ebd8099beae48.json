  "description": "Explore the Peckforton Castle Estate and the Peckforton Hills on this walk in Cheshire. The walk makes use of the Sandstone Trail to take you along woodland trails with great views of the surrounding Cheshire countryside from the elevated Sandstone Ridge. If you head north along the ridge you could also visit the ruins of the 13th century Beeston Castle. It's a short climb with fabulous views over the beautiful countryside of the Cheshire Plain. If you were to head south along the trail you would soon come to Bickerton Hill and Maiden Castle where there are more great views and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle. The circular Burwardsley Walk starts from the nearby village and climbs to the castle as well as exploring Beeston Castle, Bickerton Hill and the nearby Bulkeley Hill .",
