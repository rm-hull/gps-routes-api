  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk via country lanes around the pretty Linford Lakes area in the Ouse Valley, Milton Keynes. The route follows a section of the Hanslope Circular Ride, a cycle and walking route around Milton Keynes. The route takes you around the outside of the Linford Lakes Nature Reserve, which requires a permit for access and no cycles are allowed in the reserve. The nature reserve has a large lake, meadows, woodland and a complex of ponds. From the observation hides in the reserve you can look out for many species of bird, including waders breeding in the summer and winter visitors such as Smew and Great White Egret. Boardwalks take you through the complex of ponds, which teem with wildlife including many species of dragonfly. Permits to access the nature reserve, which must be obtained in advance, are available from http://www.theparkstrust.com/parks/linford-lakes-permit. Permit holders are welcome to cycle to the nature reserve - bicycles may be locked-up at the Study Centre situated at the reserve entrance. The route also follows a section of the Grand Union Canal and passes nearby to the historic Great Linford Manor Park. If you would like to continue your exercise you could enjoy more waterside walking along the Grand Union Canal or head to the nearby Willen Lake .",

The town is well known for being the original home of the exclusive sports car manufacturer Aston Martin. There's also a Grade I listed iron bridge dating from the early 19th century to see here.
