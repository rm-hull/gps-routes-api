    "description": "This walk climbs to Ingleborough, one of Yorshire's Three Peaks, standing at a height of 723 metres (2,372 ft). This circular walk starts in the village of Clapham and takes you along Clapham lake to Clapdale Woods. You continue along Clapham Beck toward Ingleborough Cave . You can take a short detour from the route to visit this show cave which has a long fossil gallery and interesting stalagmitic formations. From the cave you continue to Trow Gill where you will pass through a lovely, wooded limestone ravine before reaching Gaping Gill natural cave. You continue north to the summit where there are fantastic views over the Yorkshire Dales. The descent takes you through Newby Moss to Newby Cote where you pick up a country lane which takes you back to Clapham . If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could try climbing the other two of the Yorkshire Dales three peaks:- Pen y ghent and Whernside . On the southern slopes of Ingleborough you will find the fascinating Norber Erratics . The geologically significant set of glacial boulders were probably deposited by melting ice sheets at the end of the last ice age, around 12,000 years ago. They can be reached by heading south from Sulber Nick to Moughton Scar and Crummack Dale. You can also approach the mountain from the north from the famous Ribblehead Viaduct on our Whernside, Ingleborough Circular Walk . This route climbs to the summit via Park Fell and Simon Fell before heading to nearby Whernside.",
