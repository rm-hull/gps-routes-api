  "description": "This small East Sussex based village is located between Brigthe campus of Brighton & Hove Albion's Falmer Stadium. It's a pretty place with a noteworthy large gravel pond and a pretty green which is ideal for picnics in the summer months. Next to the pond is the historic parish church which dates back to the 17th century. This walk from the village takes you to Lewes using footpaths and bridleways across the South Downs. Starting in Falmer you head north east to Waterpit Hill and Balmer Down where there's the 170 metre high Balmer Huff hill and the site of the ancient medieval village of Balmer. The route then picks up a section of The South Downs Way National Trail to take you up to Blackcap and Mount Harry. Blackcap includes a splendid ridge top trail with tremendous views over the Weald, burial mounds, battle grounds and ancient trackways. It's great for flora and fauna too with butterflies fluttering around the many pretty wildflowers. You can also explore the woodland areas in Ashcombe bottom here. From Mount Harry you continue east to the village of Offham. Here you can pick up a lovely riverside path along the River Ouse which will take you south to Lewes. Here you can visit the historic 11th century castle and enjoy walks along the Sussex Ouse Valley Way .",
