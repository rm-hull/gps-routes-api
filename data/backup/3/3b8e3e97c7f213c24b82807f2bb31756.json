  "description": "This pretty country park is located on the River Goyt near Marple. The estate includes a 60 acre farm, an old orchard, a walled garden, peaceful woodland and a 16th century chapel with an audio visual presentation on the history of the site. The Etherow Goyt Valley Way runs through the park so you can continue your walk through the beautiful Goyt Valley on this trail. If you follow the river trail east you will soon come to Etherow Country Park. The park includes a pretty lakeside trail and is a nice place to extend your walk if you have time. The Romiley Walk visits the estate and the park from the train station in the nearby village. The Peak Forest Canal also runs past the estate providing an opportunity for more easy waterside walking.",
