In this area, it consists of a 15-foot wide ridge, with a shallow ditch on the southwest side. The Aberford Dykes have been identified as defences of the British kingdom of Elmet against the Anglo-Saxons in the late sixth and early seventh centuries. They have also been interpreted as dykes built to defend the territories of the Brigantes against the advance of the Roman Empire in the first century AD."

  "description": "This circular walk from Aberford explores the countryside to the east of the village, visiting the Lotherton Hall Estate on the way. The walk starts in the village and heads north east through the village to the Cock Beck. You can follow a footpath east along the beck to Lead Hall Farm and the Crooked Billet Inn. From here you head south to Coldhill Pond before turning north west along Copley Lane to return to visit Lotherton Hall. The estate includes nice footpaths taking you to woodland, parkland and gardens with the resident deer to see on the way. There's also an intersting museum, artworks, a 12th century Norman chapel and a colourful bird garden to see. The hall was bequeathed to Leeds Council in 1968 by Sir Alvary Gascoigne and his wife, last of the Gascoigne family. The Hall and parkland were opened for public access by its new owners on 6 August 1969. After exploring the hall you head north to Collier Lane and then turn east to meet with The Rein. These Linear earthworks are known as Woodhouse Moor Rein and South Dyke, and are part of the Aberford Dyke system. You can follow a bridleway north west along the earthworks before heading west along Stocks Lane and Lotherton Lane to return to the village. At the northern section the route coincides with the Hazlewood Castle Walk where you can visit the nearby estate. Here you'll find bluebell woods and a mountain bike trail to the west of the 18th century mansion which is now run as a hotel.",
