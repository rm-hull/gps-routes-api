  "description": "This large park in Darwen is great for an easy afternoon stroll. The pretty Bold Venture brook runs through the centre of the park so you can enjoy a nice waterside walk through the surrounding woodland valley. Along the way there are a number of wooden sculptures of animals and a series of waterfalls to look out for. At the western end of the park you emerge from the woodland. Here you can enjoy nice views across the surrounding moorland towards Darwen Tower. At the end near the town the park has a large lake, a war memorial and attractive formal gardens. The footpaths throughout the park are generally good paved trails. If you would like to extend your walk then you could visit Sunnyhurst Woods or continue along the Witton Weavers Way .",
