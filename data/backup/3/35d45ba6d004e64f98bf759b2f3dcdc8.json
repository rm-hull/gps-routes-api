    "description": "This waterside walk takes you along the River Lemon from Newton Abbot to Bickington in Devon. The river is a tributary of the River Teign and runs for about 10 miles from Newton Abbot onto Dartmoor. On the way there's a series of old bridges, a noteworthy medieval house and some fine views of the surrounding Devon countryside. You can start the walk in Newton Abbot and then head west towards Bradley Manor . This National Trust owned medieval limestone manor house is open to the public for a fee. You can explore the historic house with its original features, Tudor decorations and restored chapel. There's also some pleasant woodland trails around the natural limestone woodland of Bradley Woods. The walk continues west past Emblett Hill to Chercombe Bridge, Holbeam Mill, Holbeam Dam and Morley Bridge. Here you leave the river and follow Holbeam Lane north east through woodland to Millcross Bridge. The final section follows country lanes through Chipley before finishing at Bickington village. Here you can visit the 15th century church and the fine local pub.",
