This is the Phoenix United mine complex, with the landmark Pumping Engine House and its prominent chimney at the right and other mining buildings to its left. This mine produced over 16,000 tons of tin and 83,000 tons of copper between 1842 and 1898, and was re-opened after the sinking of a new shaft in 1907. However, the expected tin resources were not in place and it was re-closed in 1914."

The Trail begins at Minions village and visits St. Neot, Bodmin, St. Breward, Camelford, Five Lanes and back to Minions. The first section takes you from Minions and heads towards the delightful village of St Neot, passing the River Fowey and the photogenic Golitha Falls.  You continue from St Neot to Bodmin with lovely waterside sections along the River St Neot and past Colliford Lake. Just outside Bodmin there is a peaceful wooded section through Devlock Wood. At Bodmin you join the delightful Camel Trail, following the River Camel to St Breward and onto Camelford. From Camelford you head through Davidstow Moor, passing Crowdy Reservoir, Davidstow Woods and the old WW2 Control Tower. The path continues through Stonaford and Henwood before returning to Minions. As well as the beautiful countryside scenery you will also pass a series of ancient stone structures including King Doniert's Stones, Hurlers Stone Circle and the Cheesewring Tor near Minions.
