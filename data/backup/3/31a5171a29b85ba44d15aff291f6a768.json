The infrastructure for the camps, including the water supply, sewage systems and the roads all had to be created from scratch before work could begin on the huts and other structures."

  "description": "This walk takes you around Milford Common near Stafford. The common has a series of nice trails with woodland, grassland and ponds to see. The walk starts from the car park located at the northern end of the common. It's located just a few miles south east of Stafford, near to the canal. From the car park you can pick up the trails heading south along the Heart of England Way which runs through the common. You'll pass through the Mere Valley toward Brocton before following peaceful woodland trails through the Brocton Coppice. Other highlights include the Stepping Stones over the Sher Brook. The beauty spot is a nice place for a picnic on the route. The common is nicely located in between to other popular sites so it's easy to extend your walk if you have time. To the north you will find the lovely Shugborough Park where there's attractive parkland to explore. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal runs past the park so you could pick up the towpath for some nice easy waterside walking. To the south there's the delightful Cannock Chase Country Park with more nice footpaths and views from the high points.",

      "content": "A few miles to the north west is the worthy town of Eccleshall. The town has a particularly interesting high street with a number of Georgian buildings to admire. There's also a noteworthy 12th century church and a 13th century castle. You can walk from the town to the nearby Cop Mere where there are some nice waterside paths to try. Just to the south west you'll find the Hednesford Hills. It's an interesting place for a walk with heathland trails, a popular stock car race track and the Museum of Cannock Chase where you can learn all about the mining history of the area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
