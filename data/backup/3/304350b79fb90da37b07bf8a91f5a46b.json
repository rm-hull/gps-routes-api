  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this lovely reservoir in the Yorkshire Dales. There is a good footpath running around the reservoir with fabulous views of the surrounding countryside. The reservoir is great for bird watching, look out for wildfowl\u00a0including wigeon,\u00a0teal,\u00a0greylag geese\u00a0and\u00a0Canada geese on the water.\u00a0\u00a0Other winged visitors to the area include ringed plover,\u00a0northern lapwing,\u00a0common redshank, curlew,\u00a0reed bunting,\u00a0lesser redpoll,\u00a0whinchat\u00a0and\u00a0sedge warbler. The walk starts at the car park at the southern end of the reservoir and heads to Grimwith Moor, crossing Grimwith Beck on the way. You continue to Bracken Haw, cross the pretty Blea Gill and then pass Hebden Moor. The final section passes Hartlington pasture before returning to the car park. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Linton Falls . Just to the south is the wonderful limestone gorge at Troller's Gill . The reservoir is located close to Grassington and could be reached by following the Dales Way and other footpaths from the town.",
