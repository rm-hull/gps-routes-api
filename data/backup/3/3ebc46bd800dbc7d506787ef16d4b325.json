  "description": "A lovely coastal walk along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path from Wiseman's Bridge to Amroth. It's about a 1.5 mile walk, passing along a cliff top path with some glorious views. You can start off from the car park at the Wiseman's Bridge Inn and then make your way east along the path to Tinker Hill and Amroth. At the end of the walk you have the option of continuing to the lovely Amroth and Colby Woodland Garden. At low tide you could also return along the beach to Wiseman's Bridge.",
