The architect was James Paine, and Charles Brown, who built Richmond Bridge, was the successful tenderer for the construction work with a fee of \u00a37,325. The bridge as originally designed by Paine had five arches, but the bridge as built needed extending so a further two arches were added. Today the bridge carries the B375 road over the River Thames."

  "description": "A circular walk around the Surrey town of Chertsey, visiting the Chertsey Meads, the River Bourne, the Abbey River, the Wey Navigation and the River Thames. Along the way there's nice countryside views, pretty locks and easy riverside paths. The walk starts from the picturesque Chertsey Bridge over the River Thames. This noteworthy structure is a seven-arch white stone bridge built in 1785 and is designated as a Grade II*\u00a0listed building. Follow the public footpaths south east from the bridge and they will take you to Chertsey Meads where you can enjoy a stroll along the Bourne River and views across the open meadows. You'll pass Woburn Park and Hamm Court Farm where you pick up the Thames Path . This will take you north east past Hamhaugh Island in Weybridge . At the quay you can pick up the Weybridge to Shepperton Ferry . The ferry has been running for 500 years and enables people walking or cycling the Thames Path to continue their journey past Shepperton Lock without being diverted by the Wey Navigation. On the other side of the river you can pick up the Thames Path again and follow it west past Dumsey Eyot to Chertsey Bridge.",
