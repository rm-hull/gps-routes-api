The well mechanism was created in 1863 by the Wallingford company RJ and H Wilder, and the pavilion over the well was finished in 1864. The open-sided pavilion has a cupola on top, an elephant in a golden colour above the well mechanism, and open sides. On the north side of the main road that runs through Stoke Row village, there is a small park where the well and pavilion can be seen."

  "description": "This walk takes you around the pretty Oxfordshire village of Stoke Row. On the walk you will visit the notable features of the settlement including the village green, the Maharajah's Well and the Cherry Orchard. You'll also pass the noteworthy 17th century pub which has a splendid history and has been used as a filming location on many occasions. The distinctive Maharajah's Well is one of the highlights of the village. It dates from 1863 and is a collaboration between The Maharajah of Benares and local squire Edward Anderton Reade. A pretty cherry orchard sits next to the structure and is a nice place for a stroll in the village. To continue your walking in the area head east to visit the National Trust's Greys Court. The 16th century mansion is another local highlight and includes some beautiful parkland and gardens. Near here you will find the delightful town of Henley-on-Thames where you can enjoy lovely riverside walks along the Thames.",
