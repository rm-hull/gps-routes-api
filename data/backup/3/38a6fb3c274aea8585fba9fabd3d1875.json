  "description": "A splendid circular walk from the Lake District village of Elterwater, visiting the Colwith Force and Skelwith Force waterfalls. There's much to enjoy with riverside footpaths, splendid views of the surrounding fells and the rushing waters of the two splendid falls. The walk start from Elterwater, with its popular pub and old bridge over the Great Langdale Beck. You then climb up country lanes to reach Colwith Force Waterfall. The falls 40 feet over several stages\u00a0and are surrounded by peaceful woodland. It's a secluded spot with the just the noise of the impressive falls breaking the silence. Around here you pick up the Cumbria Way long distance trail and descend past Elterwater Park Farm to Skelwith Bridge . Here you will pass the impressive Skelwith Force Falls. Though small the falls are very powerful and can be seen up close from the viewing area. There's also some nice riverside tea rooms here where you can enjoy refreshments before continuing your walk. The next stage takes you along the River Brathay and then Great Langdale Beck to Elterwater. The beck is very still around here so it's a lovely spot. The route here also uses a National Trust maintained footpath so it's very easy going. There's great views of the Langdale Fells return to Elterwater where you can enjoy a well earned drink in the pub garden...weather permitting! To extend your walk follow the Cumbria Way south from Colwith Force and you can visit the beautiful Tarn Hows . The walk up to Loughrigg Tarn starts from Skelwith Bridge so you could also take in this much loved beauty spot if you have time.",
