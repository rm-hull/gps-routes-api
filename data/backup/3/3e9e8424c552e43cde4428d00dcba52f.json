The Hampshire County Council website says: \"Roydon Woods contains a wonderful patchwork of habitats which support wildlife typical of the New Forest but without the pressures of grazing. The 750 acre site, which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is mainly woodland with small areas of meadow heath, ponds and a section of the Lymington River. It was gifted freehold to the Trust by Peter Barker-Mill in 1978. Roydon has been privately owned since the time of the\u00a0Domesday Book. For a time it was monastic property but following the Dissolution of the Monasteries became Crown land for a short time. Banks and ditches provide visual evidence of centuries of forestry and farming which have produced the landscape seen and enjoyed today.\""

  "description": "This route follows bridleways between Brockenhurst and the village of Boldre in the New Forest. It's suitable for both cyclists and walkers, following country lanes and traffic free forest paths through a really pretty section of the forest. The route also passes the delightful Roydon Woods which consists of ancient woodland, pastures, ponds, heaths and the Lymington River. It's worth exploring this area and looking out for the wide variety of wildlife that dwells here. This includes Tawny owls, nightjars, various butterflies and deer.",
