  "description": "This short cliff top walk takes you from Robin Hood's Bay to the smugglers cove of Boggle Hole. It's about a 1 mile walk using a section of the Cleveland Way National Trail. There's wonderful views down the North York Moors coast from the elevated path. Start the walk from the picturesque fishing village of Robin Hood's Bay. It's one of the jewels of the Yorkshire coast with lots of delightful old fishermen's cottages and a lovely beach. From the village you head south along the cliff top path to Mill Beck. Here you will find the Boggle Hole Youth Hostel which used to be an old mill. You can stop for refreshments at the walker's cafe here. The hostel is a short stroll from the lovely beach at Boggle Hole. The area is named after the local name for a hobgoblin, a mischievous 'little person' thought to dwell in the caves along the coast. Smugglers used the local caves to conceal their contraband including rum and tobacco. The beach is a popular place for fossil hunters so keep your eyes peeled as you make your way through the area. At low tide you can return along the foreshore, but please carefully check the tide times beforehand. It's a lovely section of beach with fine views of the bay and surrounding cliffs. To extend your walking in the area you could continue south along the coastal path to Scarborough. The Whitby to Robin's Hood Bay Walk will take you north to nearby Whitby .",
