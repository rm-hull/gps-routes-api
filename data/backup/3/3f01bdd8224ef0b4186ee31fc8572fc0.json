  "description": "This walk takes you to the Coaley Peak viewpoint from the village of Uley in the Cotswolds. The walk uses part of the Cotswold Way National Trail to take you through Coaley Wood to the viewpoint. At the peak there is a display showing all the landmarks you can see in the area. The walk starts from the car park on Crawley Hill road next to Uley Bury. It's worth exploring the Iron Age hill fort on Uley Hill before starting your climb to the peak. From here you head north through the woods for about 1.5 miles before reaching the viewpoint. Here you will find farmland and a wildflower meadow. There are also splendid views over the Severn Vale and the Forest of Dean. There is a good sized car park at the site if you prefer to visit directly. See the google street view link below for the view from there. Near the hill you will find Woodchester Park which is a great place to extend your walk. The extensive park includes a series of lakes and woodland trails. Just to the south west is the lovely Cam Peak near Dursley. You can cross Cam Long Down on the Cotswold Way with more great views to enjoy.",
