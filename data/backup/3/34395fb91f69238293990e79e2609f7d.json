  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the Mumbles headland on the western edge of Swansea Bay, just south of Swansea. It starts by the bus station and information centre near Oystermouth Castle. It's well worth exploring the ruins of the 12 century Norman Castle before starting the coastal walk. There are lovely views over the bay from the castle grounds. You head along the coast to Mumbles Head where there is a lifeboat station and a nice long pier to stroll out on. From here there are great views out to Mumbles Head and the lighthouse. You continue along the coast, passing Bracelet Bay and Limeslade Bay before heading to the lovely Langland Bay. There's a nice beach here and great views down the Gower coast. If you'd like to extend your walk you could continue along the Gower coast on our Mumbles to Langland and Caswell Bay Walk where you'll visit a lovely beach popular with tourists and surgers. Just beyond Caswell Bay there's the delightful Bishopston Valley and the beautiful secluded beach at Pwll Du Bay.",
