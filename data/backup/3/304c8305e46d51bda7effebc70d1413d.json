  "description": "This circular walk explores Black Island at Lough Muckno in County Monaghan near the town of Castleblayney. You can start the walk from the car park near Blaney Castle on the eastern side of Castleblayney. Heading east from here will take you onto the Black Island Walk where there are woodland trails and a Shoreline Walk on the eastern edge. Along the way there's lovely views across the lake to the surrounding countryside. Also look out for a variety of woodland birds and other wildlife. The area is now part of a leisure complex where there are several places for refreshments, watersport activities and a picnic area. More details on the history of the area can be found below. To continue your walking in the area you could head east into Northern Ireland to visit the Ring of Gullion AONB. Here you can climb to Slieve Gullion and enjoy some wonderful views over the area.",
