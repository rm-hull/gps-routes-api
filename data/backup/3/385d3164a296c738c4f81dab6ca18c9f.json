  "description": "This walk visits the little village of Poolewe, next to Loch Ewe in the Scottish Highlands. The area is well known for Inverewe Garden which lies just to the north of the settlement. The lochside gardens are a lovely place for a stroll with some nice footpaths taking you to subtropical plants, fine lawns and beautiful flowers. From the area there are some splendid views over the loch to the surrounding mountains. You can enjoy a walk along the beach to visit the gardens from the village or the public car park near the gardens. Look out for wildlife including red squirrels, red deer, otters, seals and golden eagles as you make your way through the area. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit Loch Gairloch where you can pick up the Gairloch Waterfall Walk in the lovely Flowerdale Glen. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Poolewe. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
