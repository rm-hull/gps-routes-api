  "description": "Enjoy splendid views over the Dark Peak on this climb to the gritstone escarpment of Froggatt Edge. There's interesting rock formations, sheltered birch woodland and lots of lovely heather to see in the late summer. You can start the walk from the car park just to the south of Nether Padley on the A625. Grindleford railway station in Upper Padley is also very close by. From the car park you can pick up footpaths heading south along the escarpment toward the village of Froggatt. It's a nice path with attractive woodland, a pretty stream and splendid views to enjoy. The route then descends to the village of Froggatt which has a pub and a quaint 17th-century bridge. At the bridge you can pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way to take you along the river toward Grindleford. Here you turn east to follow woodland trails through Hay Wood back to the car park. Near here you can enjoy refreshments at The Grouse Inn which offers a good selection of meals. There's lots of good options for extending your walking in the area. Easiest is to just continue a little way to the south and explore Curbar Edge where there's more magnificent views over the Eastern Moors. The video below shows a longer route which takes in both escarpments. Just to the north is the National Trust owned Longshaw Estate .  It's excellent for walkers with miles of trails taking you to ancient woods, parkland and heather moorland. The ridge is close to both Eyam and Hathersage which make alternative start points for the route.",
