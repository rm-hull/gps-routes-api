  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk or cycle around the lovely Thirlmere Reservoir in the Lake District National Park. The route starts at Wythburn at the Steel End car park at the southern end of the lake and then follows the National Cycle Network route on the western side of the lake. On the return on the eastern side of the lake walkers can follow the woodland trail at the lower part of Helvellyn . Cyclists can follow the A591 which runs right alongside the lake for a couple of miles. You can get a bite to eat at the inn at Thirlspot with more details below. The lake runs for a distance of about 3 miles and includes an impressive 104 foot high dam. On the western side of the lake there's a pleasant climb to Harrop Tarn along the Dob Gill. There's a car park here and a pretty waterfall to see before you reach the picturesque little tarn.",
