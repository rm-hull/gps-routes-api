  "description": "This huge country park has 3000 acres of cycling and walking trails to explore. The route starts at the park cycle hire centre and takes you to Brindley Heath on woodland trails before returning to the start point. Cannock Chase is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty with a large variety of wildlife including 800 fallow deer. The park is located just a few miles from Stafford . Several long distance, waymarked trails run through the area including the Two Saints Way , Heart of England Way and the Sabrina Way . These trails are a great way to extend your walking in the area. If you head a short distance east from the park you can visit Milford Common where there's some nice trails through grassland and woodland to try. The Open Street Map below shows many of the cycle trails and walking trails you can try. The ones marked in blue are the mtb trails and include the Twist and Shout, Rock N' Rollers, and the Stegosaurus. The Cross Chase Walk is also shown heading south west from the visitor centre through the forest.",
