  "description": "Follow the heathland trails across these two pretty commons on this walk in Midhurst in Sussex. There's a car park off Elsted Road which gives direct access to the footpaths. On the commons you'll find a large pond and lots of wildlife. Look out for woodlark, Dartford warbler, nightjar and stonechat. To extend your walking in the area you can head north towards Woolbeding Common . The National Trust managed area has miles of good footpaths taking you to woodland, heathland and ponds. Also nearby is the New Lipchis Way which runs through the lovely Rother Valley. You can pick up the riverside trail just to the north of Stedham. It can be followed east all the way to Midhurst or north to Woolbeding Common. The Serpent Trail also crosses the common. You can follow it west towards Petersfield or east towards Midhurst Common, Graffham Common and the National Trust owned Lavington Common .",
