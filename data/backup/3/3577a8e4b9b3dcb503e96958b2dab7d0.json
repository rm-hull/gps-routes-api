  "description": "Follow the heathland trails across these two pretty commons on this walk in Midhurst in Sussex. There's a car park off Elsted Road which gives direct access to the footpaths. On the commons you'll find a large pond and lots of wildlife. Look out for woodlark, Dartford warbler, nightjar and stonechat. To extend your walking in the area you can head north towards Woolbeding Common. The National Trust managed area has miles of good footpaths taking you to woodland, heathland and ponds. Also nearby is the New Lipchis Way which runs through the lovely Rother Valley. You can pick up the riverside trail just to the north of Stedham. It can be followed east all the way to Midhurst or north to Woolbeding Common. The Serpent Trail also crosses the common. You can follow it west towards Petersfield or east towards Midhurst Common, Graffham Common and the National Trust owned Lavington Common .",

      "content": "One good option is to follow the New Lipchis Way east for a couple of miles to visit the wonderful Cowdray Park. There's miles of trails here taking you to a ruined castle, walled garden, pretty ponds and a noteworthy ancient oak. You can pick up the Midhurst Way here which will take you through the South Downs. Just a few miles to the south west there's another splendid viewpoint at Harting Down. Near here there's also the National Trust's Uppark. Here you'll find a fine 17th century Georgian House surrounded by lovely gardens with views of the English Channel. The author H.G Wells stayed in the house during the late 19th century. The class divisions he observed here inspired his socialist views which later manifested themselves in work such as 'The Time Machine'. You can find the house at postcode GU31 5QR. For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks and South Downs Walks pages."
