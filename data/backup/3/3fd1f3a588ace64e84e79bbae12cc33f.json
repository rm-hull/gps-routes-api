  "description": "This circular walk visits the Harestanes countryside centre near Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. The area is a fine place for a walk with woodland trails and a climb to the Waterloo Monument on Peniel Heugh hill. From here there are some wonderful views over the surrounding countryside and hills. The 150-foot tower was built between 1817 and 1824 to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo and is something of a local landmark. You can start and end the walk from the Harestanes Visitor Centre where there is a car park and facilities. The route also passes very close to Monteviot House where you can explore the beautiful grounds and gardens of an historic 18th century house. It's a lovely place for a stroll with views of the River Teviot, ornate ponds and an Arboretum to explore. The Borders Abbeys Way and the St Cuthbert's Way both pass through the area. You could pick up either of these long distance trails to extend the walk.",
