  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Mam Tor from the village of Edale in the Peak District National Park. Edale is a great base for climbing the famous hill. It has a visitor centre with lots of information and parking. There's also a train station for those coming by public transport. Starting at the visitor centre in Edale, the walk climbs to Hollins Cross, before turning south west to climb to Mam Tor. From the summit there are fabulous views over the Eden Valley and the Peak Dsitrict hills. After taking in the expansive views, the route then turns north to take you across Cold Side, back to Edale. If you enjoy this walk then try the splendid Ridge Walk from Mam Tor to Lose Hill. This takes you along the famous Great Ridge with stunning views the whole way. You could also pick up the long distance Pennine Way in Edale and climb towards the nearby Kinder Scout .",
