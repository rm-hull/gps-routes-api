The dense coniferous planting gives way to the concrete remains at various points. Here we see the remains of a SW-NE runway. The public road (where the photo was taken) runs along the route of the old airfield perimeter road. This area can be reached by heading a short distance north from the reservoir."

  "description": "This short walk follows a section of the Copper Trail from Crowdy Reservoir to Davidstow Woods on Bodmin Moor. The walk starts from the Crowdy Reservoir car park and follows country lanes past the reservoir to the nearby woods. It's a nice easy short walk with good views across the water to the surrounding countryside. The reservoir and the surrounding Crowdy marsh are also good for birdwatching with gadwall, goldeneye, goosander, mallard, common pochard, shoveler, teal and tufted duck to look out for. You may also see ponies grazing on Davidstow Moor. To extend your walk head south and climb to Brown Willy and Rough Tor - the two highest points on the moor.",

The Masons Arms does good food and has a lovely garden area to sit in when the weather is good. The interior is full of character with a ceiling full of old bottles, mugs, cups, tankards and old newspaper clippings. You can find the pub in the market place at a postcode of PL32 9PB for your sat navs. The Camelford Way long distance footpath can also be picked up in the town. The trail explores the River Camel Valley to the south of the riverside settlement."
