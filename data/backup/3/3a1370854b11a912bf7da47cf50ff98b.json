The area is part of the Seaton Wetlands Nature Reserve which includes the marshes and Colyford Common. The reserve is located just to the north of the town and includes ditches and ponds that attract large variety of wildfowl, waders and butterflies. There's also numerous creeks and lagoons with Little Egrets, Curlew and White Shelducks to look out for. The marshes are positioned next to the Axe Estuary so there are also great views across the river to the Axe Marsh on the other side. The reserve has very good facilities with a car park, viewing platforms, picnic tables and a discovery hut. You can extend the walk by continuing on to Colyton . Seaton Marshes is located just to the west of the wonderful Undercliff National Nature Reserve. You can visit the reserve on the Lyme Regis to Seaton Undercliff Walk .
