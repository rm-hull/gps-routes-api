  "description": "Climb to this prominent fell in the Yorkshire Dales and enjoy wonderful views over the surrounding hills and countryside. The circular walk starts from the beautiful Malham Tarn and climbs to the fell using a section of the Pennine Way National Trail. The route climbs to a height of 668 metres (2,192\u00a0ft) with lovely views of the pretty Fountains Fell Tarn below. At the northern tip of the route you have the option of following the Pennine Way north west to Pen y ghent , one of the famous three peaks of Yorkshire. To extend your walking in the area you can explore the Malham Tarn estate with its glacial lake and Tarn Moss Nature Reserve. There's also the climb to Gordale Scar , the fascinating Malham Cove and the beautiful Janet's Foss waterfall to visit on the estate. The route of the Settle Loop also passes just to the south west of the fell.",
