  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Blacko Tower from the village of Blacko in Lancashire. There's no access to the tower itself but you can follow public footpaths around the monument and enjoy some fine views. It's also known as Stansfield Tower having been built in the late 19th century by John Stansfield, a local grocer who wanted to provide a viewpoint over Ribblesdale. The route starts in the village and uses part of the Pendle Way and other public paths to take you around the site. On the way there are some splendid views over the Yorkshire Dales.",
