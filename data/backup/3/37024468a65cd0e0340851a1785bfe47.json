Officially opened in 1987, the circular route spans 45 miles (72 km) and features a challenging ascent of 1,839 metres (6,033 feet), with the highest point reaching 557 metres (1,827 feet) on Pendle Hill. The path is rich in historical and cultural significance, with connections to the infamous seventeenth-century Pendle Witches, whose trials have left a lasting mark on the region's folklore. The trail also has ties to the Bront\u00eb sisters, who drew inspiration from the area's dramatic landscapes for their novels."

This historic house, once occupied by distant ancestors of Roger Bannister who ran the first four minute mile, now houses the Pendle Heritage Centre, restaurant, museum and shop. The centre is located at Park Hill, a historic two-storey former farmhouse that bears a date stone from 1661. However, the building itself evolved over a long period, with development spanning from the 16th century to the early 18th century. The centre features an 18th-century walled garden and a woodland walk and also houses the Pendle Arts Gallery. Park Hill has been meticulously restored using traditional building techniques, providing visitors with an insight into the historical development and adaptation of the house from the 15th century onwards. The centre, established in 1977, is one of the flagship projects of the Heritage Trust for the North West and attracts over 100,000 visitors annually. The permanent exhibitions at the centre include the story of Park Hill as a working farm, the history of the Bannister and Swinglehurst families who once lived there, and the infamous Pendle witches. Sir Roger Bannister, famous for breaking the four-minute mile, is a descendant of the Bannister family that once occupied the house. In 2012, to mark the 400th anniversary of the Pendle witches' trials, a new long-distance walking route called the Lancashire Witches Walk was established. Ten tercet waymarkers, designed by artist Stephen Raw and inscribed with verses of a poem by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, have been installed along the route, with the first marker located at Park Hill to signify the starting point."

  "description": "Follow the Pendle Way through Lancashire and visit Barnoldswick, Thornton-in-Craven, Wycoller, Reedley, Newchurch and Pendle Hill on this challenging walk. The climb to the 557 metre (1,827 ft) summit of Pendle Hill is a real highlight. There are fabulous views over the Pennines to the east, the Bowland Fells to the northwest, and the West Pennine Moors to the south. You also pass the beautiful Upper and Lower Ogden Reservoirs on this section of the walk. The area is famous for the Pendle Hill Witch Trials. These took place in 1612 when twelve people from the area were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft. Ten were subsequently found guilty and executed by hanging.",
