The original Wolds Way long distance footpath was established in 1982 and covered 76 miles from the Humber Bridge at Hessle to Filey Brigg on the North Sea coast. The route headed southeast through Londesborough Park and across the old ford on the park lake before heading down to Goodmanham. The route was largely superseded by the 79-mile Yorkshire Wolds Way in 2003, the main course of which now heads due south from Londesborough along Towthorpe Beck to the western outskirts of Market Weighton."

Hudson intended to live here and build a railway from York to Market Weighton with his own private station at Shiptonthorpe. He had a two-mile avenue of trees planted between the railway and the park but then things started to go wrong. \"The King\" ran into financial difficulties with the collapse of the over-inflated railway share price and was accused of corruption, bribing MPs and selling land he did not own. He left Londesborough in disgrace and was imprisoned in York Castle for debt in 1865."

Officially 'Weedley Tunnel' it has become known as 'Sugar Loaf Tunnel', a name presumably given to it by walkers on the nearby Yorkshire Wolds Way (there are other Sugar Loaf Tunnels including those on the Heart of Wales and the Richmond Vale railway lines). The reason for this nickname is obvious: there's a constant supply of white chalk dust spilling down from the hillside above the tunnel entrance.\nThe Hull & Barnsley Railway was built in the 1880s together with Alexandra Dock in Hull, to break the monopoly of the North Eastern Railway Company and provide an additional trading route inland from the busy Humber port. The railway didn't last long. Services west of South Howden station were withdrawn from 1st January 1932 and the regular service between Hull and South Howden ended on 30th July 1955, although some excursion traffic continued to use this picturesque route through The Wolds until about 1958. After that only a short section of the railway remained in Hull serving the local chemical works until the 1970s when another short stretch of the line just south of Selby was reopened for delivering coal to the newly built Drax Power Station. The steep-sided cutting through the sandstone and chalk between Weedley Tunnel and Drewton Tunnel later became a quarry, operated by Stoneledge Plant & Transport of Cottingham."
