  "description": "This country park is located a few miles to the south of Edinburgh city centre. The park features cycle and walking trails taking you through woodland and open moorland to a series of reservoirs. There are excellent views of the Pentland Hills, Edinburgh, the Lothians, Fife and the Firth of Forth from the park. The park is located near to the Water of Leith where you will find a lovely, waterside cycling and walking path. This leads to the Union Canal which you can follow into the centre of Edinburgh. Also nearby is the climb to Arthur's Seat. This splendid hike is a real highlight of the area, commanding fine views over city and the coast.",
