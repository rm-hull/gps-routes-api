  "description": "This country park is located a few miles to the south of Edinburgh city centre. The park features cycle and walking trails taking you through woodland and open moorland to a series of reservoirs. There are excellent views of the Pentland Hills, Edinburgh, the Lothians, Fife and the Firth of Forth from the park. The park is located near to the Water of Leith where you will find a lovely, waterside cycling and walking path. This leads to the Union Canal which you can follow into the centre of Edinburgh. Also nearby is the climb to Arthur's Seat. This splendid hike is a real highlight of the area, commanding fine views over city and the coast.",

Head a couple of miles south west and there are more waterside walking opportunites at Harlaw Reservoir and Threipmuir Reservoir. Just to the south of Arthur's Seat there's the pretty Duddingston Loch to explore. There's some nice waterside paths and the splendid Dr Neil's Garden to enjoy here. There's also some history in Duddingston village with a 12th century church and a 14th century pub, thought to be oldest in Scotland. Near here there's Portobello where you can try the Edinburgh Coastal Beach Walk. There's a popular 2 mile stretch of sandy beach with some fine Georgian architecture, Ice cream parlours, arcades, beach-side cafes and bars here. For a fine hill climb you could head north east to Blackford Hill where you can also visit the delightful woodland at Hermitage Of Braid. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pentland Hills Walks and the Edinburgh Walks pages."
