  "description": "This delightful village is located on the Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd. The village is well known for its splendid long beach which stretches for two miles from Ynys Cyngar on the River Glaslyn estuary along Tremadog Bay to Criccieth beach. This walk from the village follows a section of the Llyn Coastal Path to neighbouring Criccieth where you can visit the 13th century Criccieth Castle ruins and the grave of former Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The walk starts from the car park at Black Rock Sands. The wide sandy beach is a real highlight of the area with sand dunes, a large multi-coloured headland rock, low-tide caves, rock pools, and a variety of marine life. From here you head west across the beach to Graig Ddu, the Black Rock. From the imposing rock there are some fine views to the mountains of Snowdonia. The trail then runs along the railway line before coming into Criccieth. To continue your walking in the area head east to visit the lovely village of Borth-Y-Gest where there's a picturesque harbour and some fine beaches.",
