  "description": "This village near Leeds has a series of pleasant waterside footpaths to try. It's a nice place for an easy walk with plenty of wildfowl to see and a fine riverside pub for post walk refreshment. This walk from the village visits the Allerton Ings and St Aidan's nature reserve. In the village you'll find a number of small lakes or 'Ings' with pleasant waterside footpaths. The River Aire also runs through the area so there's plenty of water loving wildlife to look out for on the way. Keep your eyes peeled for species such as bittern, marsh harrier and skylark on the walk.",
