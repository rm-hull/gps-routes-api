  "description": "This waterside walk in Stockton-on-Tees\u00a0explores the riverside paths next to the River Tees Barrage. The 3.5 mile circular route runs on nice flat trails on both sides of the river. The route starts from the car park on the northern side of the river near to the Tees Barrage. The barrage is\u00a0used to control the flow of the river, preventing\u00a0flooding\u00a0and the effects of\u00a0tidal change. It consists of a river\u00a0barrage,\u00a0road bridge,\u00a0footbridge, barge\u00a0lock,\u00a0fish pass\u00a0and\u00a0white water course. The area is used for watersports such as\u00a0canoeing,\u00a0jet skiing,\u00a0dragonboat\u00a0racing and incorporates a 1\u00a0km\u00a0rowing\u00a0course. You start by crossing the river on the barrage footbridge before heading west along the path to the impressive Infinity Bridge. The bridge links the\u00a0Teesdale Business Park\u00a0and the\u00a0University of Durham's Queen's Campus\u00a0in\u00a0Thornaby-on-Tees\u00a0on the south bank of the Tees with the\u00a0Tees Valley Regeneration's \u00a3320\u00a0million North Shore development on the north bank. The name derives from the\u00a0infinity symbol\u00a0formed by the bridge and its reflection. The route continues past the University Colleges to the Victoria Bridge where you cross to the other side of the river. Here you can pick up the Teesdale Way and follow it east along the northern side of the river, back to the car park. You can extend the walk by heading east from the car park and visiting Maze Park on the southern side of the river. The nature reserve is rough grassland, supporting herbs and broad-leaved plants and has three landscaped viewing mounds giving panoramic views of the\u00a0Green Blue Heart\u00a0of the\u00a0Tees Corridor.\u00a0There's some attractive flora and fauna to see with birds including blackcap,\u00a0chaffinch,\u00a0grasshopper warbler,\u00a0grey partridge,\u00a0kingfisher,\u00a0sand martin,\u00a0skylark\u00a0and\u00a0sparrowhawk. The park is directly opposite Portrack Marsh Nature Reserve where you can enjoy a nice wetland area and a wildflower meadow. You could also pay a visit Coatham Woods where there some more nice nature trails to try.",
