An information board in the car park off the left of shot states that the car park is adjacent to the old Brecon & Neath railway. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of the dismantled railway by the car park. The only sign I could find is that the large yellow building is a pub called \"The Usk Railway\"."

  "description": "This Powys based village is located in the Brecon Beacons at the point where the rivers Senni and Usk meet. Walking highlights include the Epynt Way, a long distance trail which explores the Sennybridge Army Training Area. The circular route can be picked up a few miles north of the village. This short circular walk takes you around the village and then along the River Usk with some nice views of the surrounding countryside. To continue your walking in the area head west to visit Usk Reservoir where there are some splendid waterside walking and cycling trails. Also nearby is the neighbouring village of Trecastle where you can enjoy a climb to Trecastle Mountain and visit the ancient Roman site of Y Pigwn.",
