You could head to the Bridge Inn in Upper Woodford for example. The main attraction here is a lovely riverside garden where you can sit out and enjoy lunch with views of the River Avon. You can find it at postcode SP4 6NU.Also consider the 17th century Black Horse in nearby Great Durnford (postcode: SP4 6AY). There's another nice, large outdoor seating area for the summer months here. In Great Durnford you could also visit the interesting Norman Church and admire some delightful thatched cottages. The converted mill is also very picturesque with its riverside location and weeping willows."
