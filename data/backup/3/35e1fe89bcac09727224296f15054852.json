  "description": "This walk explores the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Wood near Normanton Le Heath in the National Forest. These peaceful Leicestershire woods were planted in 2012 to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The site is criss crossed with a number of pleasant waymarked footpaths taking you to a picturesque lake and the Bowers Brook on the eastern edge. You can start your walk from the free car park on Heather Lane on the western side of the woods. Then head east towards the lake where you can see a variety of water loving wildlife. Birds of note include little grebes, tufter ducks, skylarks, buzzards and hen harrier. The woods are located right next to the lovely Sence Valley Forest Park so it's easy to extend your outing if you have time. Just follow a bridletrack south east for about half a mile and you will come to the site. There's a series of pretty lakes and some more fine walking and cycling trails here. The Kelham Bridge Nature Reserve can also be found just a mile or so to the east. You can reach it by following the National Forest Way, a long distance trail which explores some of the highlights of the National Forest area.",
