Within its 13 feet high, 15 feet thick walls, 150 huts provided a wild refuge from the pax romana. The Romans had a base at Caernarfon, 15 miles away, but Tre'r Ceir's height and steep approaches and maybe its remoteness meant that it was never slighted by their army. With the departure of the Romans it was abandoned."

Tre\u0092r Ceiri stands at 485m, one of the highest hillforts in Britain and probably dates from the years immediately preceding the Roman invasion of Wales in AD 78. It appears to have been abandoned after the Romans left Wales."

The former Calvinist chapel, Capel Seilo, is now the Welsh language centre. In the 19th century, Mass was also celebrated in the valley as many of the quarrymen were Irish immigrants who arrived here by ship. Ty Hen represents the older pre-industrial phase of farming and fishing. The cafe is a fine place to go for refreshments after your walk."

  "description": "This walk climbs to the Iron Age Hillfort of Tre'r Ceiri on the Llyn Peninsula in Wales. It's about a 1.5 mile walk from the conveniently located car park near the village of Llithfaen. In total it's 3 miles there and back with a moderate climb, so a reasonable level of fitness is required. The walk starts from the Yr Eifl car park, just to the west of the hill. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north east up to the hill fort. The fort dates back to the Iron Age and is thought to have been constructed around 200 B.C. It sits at a height of 450 metres (1,480 ft) and is considered one of the finest forts in the UK, with much of the original structure still in place. There are also fabulous views to the surrounding mountains and the coastline with Cardigan Bay clearly visible. The fort sits on the slopes of Yr Eifl so you could continue your walk by heading west from the fort to climb to the adjacent summit.",
