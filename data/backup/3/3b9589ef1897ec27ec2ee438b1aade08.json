      "caption": "Summit of Garway Hill in December 2015. In June 1941, three RAF men spent three weeks assessing whether Garway Hill was a suitable site for a radio transmitter, shortly after a brick structure with an octagonal wooden tower was constructed on top. The structure was 25 feet high with a conical roof through which an aerial/transmitter protruded. Eight wooden stanchions reaching down over the wall supported the tower, each stanchion was anchored in concrete, these can still be seen today. The brick wall is 7 feet high and 14 inches thick. Nearby was an accommodation block and also an engine house supplying electrical power to the transmitter. The wooden tower was demolished and removed in 1948; however, the accommodation block remained until the 1970s."

  "description": "Climb across Garway Common to the summit of Garway Hill on this walk in in south-west Herefordshire. There is a car park on the south eastern corner of the common where you can pick up the footpath to the hill. From the 1200ft (366m) summit there are splendid views over the Bristol Channel into Wales. On a clear day you can see Ross-on-Wye, May Hill, Skirrid Fawr, Sugarloaf Mountain and the Forest of Dean. After climbing the hill you can pick up any number of footpaths to explore the rest of Garway Common. To extend your walking in the area you could head to nearby Grosmont and pick up the Three Castles Walk. The trail can be followed to Skenfrith where you can explore the photogenic ruins of the 13th century castle. Also nearby is Kentchurch Court. The grade I listed stately home has beautiful gardens and a deer park.",
