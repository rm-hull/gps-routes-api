  "description": "This walk visits the North Cave Wetlands nature reserve in North Cave, East Riding of Yorkshire. The reserve is located just to the north west of the village with parking available at the site. You can then pick up a circular footpath taking you around the reserve's pretty lakes. It's an easy trail with grassy and surfaced section. There's lots of birdlife to look out for with a number of hides dotted around the site. Highlights include avocets and common terns, Sedge warbler, Snipe and lots of waders on the water. To continue your walking in the area head a couple of miles north to visit North Cliffe Woods near Market Weighton. The bluebell woods are also a nature reserve with deer to look out for from the shady paths.",
