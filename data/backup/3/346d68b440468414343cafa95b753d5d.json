  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along this 210 acre reservoir in Melbourne, Derbyshire. The reservoir has an excellent Visitor Centre with exhibitions, a pretty wildflower meadow with a variety of wildlife and peaceful woodland trails. There's a well surfaced footpath running from the visitor centre at the northern end of the lake. You can enjoy great views across the water to the surrounding Derbyshire countryside. If you'd like to extend your walk you could head into the adjacent Calke Abbey. Here you will find woodland, ponds, meadows and a deer park. Also nearby is Foremark Reservoir where you'll find woodland trails and waterside paths. The National Forest Way passes through the area. The long distance trail can be followed to the park, the reservoir and several of the other highlights of the National Forest area.",
