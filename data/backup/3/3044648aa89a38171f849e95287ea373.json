  "description": "This waymarked walking trail takes you from Bangor Erris to the Wild Nephin National Park in County Mayo.  It's a challenging hike taking you through Atlantic blanket bog terrain and the Nephin Beg Mountain range. The linear trail runs for about 25km following an ancient drover path through a remote area. As such the walk is best suited to experience walkers and climbers. See the wild camping video below for more information on the dramatic scenery you can expect to see on the route.",
