  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside and neighbouring villages around the Northamptonshire village of Ringstead. The route makes use of a section of the Nene Way which runs through the area. On the way you'll visit the village of Denford and Woodford while enjoying waterside paths along the river and lakes which are typical of the area. The walk can be started and finished from the public car park just west of the village at the pretty Kinewell Lake. The lake is a lovely place for an easy stroll with lots of wildlife to see on the way. The paths on the lake will take you up to the pretty Woodford Mill on the Nene. The walk can easily be extended by heading a short distance to the north to visit Thrapston and the lovely Titchmarsh Nature Reserve .",
