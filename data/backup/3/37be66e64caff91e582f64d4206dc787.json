  "description": "This walk visits a section of the fascinating Heart of Neolithic Orkney World heritage Site on Mainland island. The settlements are in a beautiful spot, next to the Loch of Stenness and surrounded by heather and wildlfowers. The area is also a RSPB Reserve with lots of wildlife to see. Look out for Curlews, drumming snipe, lapwings, dunlins, redshanks and oystercatchers\u00a0as you make your way around the site. The notable ring of stones stands on a small\u00a0isthmus\u00a0between the\u00a0Lochs of Stenness\u00a0and\u00a0Harray. They are the northernmost circle henge in\u00a0Britain and the third largest. It is thought to have been erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC. After exploring the site you can head south east for just over half a mile and visit the Standing Stones of Stenness. The stones may be the oldest\u00a0henge\u00a0site in the British Isles. \u00a0Based on\u00a0radiocarbon dating, it is thought that work on the site had begun by 3100 BC. Just next to the stones you will find Maeshowe. The\u00a0Neolithic\u00a0chambered cairn\u00a0and\u00a0passage grave\u00a0dates from around\u00a02800 BC. It's an impressive sight and one of the largest tombs in Orkney. The mound encasing the tomb is 115 feet (35\u00a0m) in diameter and rises to a height of 24 feet (7.3\u00a0m). You can extend your walk by heading to Skara Brae and the Bay of Skaill . You can virtually explore the area on the google street view link below!",
