  "description": "This walk from the Dorset village of Sturminster Marshall explores the National Trust's White Mill before following a section of the Stour Valley Way to Kingston Lacy, Pamphill and Wimborne. The idyllic village is a pleasant place for a stroll with picturesque thatched cottages, a 13th century church, a fine local pub, riverside trails and a noteworthy old mill to visit. The walk starts from the White Mill car park, located next to the River Stour, just north of the village. The 18th century mill is in a photogenic spot with a pretty garden by the river. On certain days you can enjoy a guided tour detailing the history of the mill. From here you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it east past Kingston Lacy to delightful village of Pamphill. The route continues into Wimborne before finishing at the historic Wimborne Minster.",
