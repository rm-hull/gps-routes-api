  "description": "This pretty village in South Gloucestershire is surrounded by some beautiful rolling Cotswolds countryside. The village includes a picturesque village pond, quaint old stone cottages and a noteworthy ancient pub which dates back over 400 years. This circular walk from the village visits one of the area's local highlights at Horton Court . The walk starts in the village and follows public footpaths west to link up with the Cotswold Way .  Follow the waymarked trail south and it will take you along Bath Lane and Highfield Lane to Horton Court. The Grade I listed manor house dates back to the 16th century and includes a 12th century Norman Tower. The house is surrounded by some lovely gardens and grounds which includes a pretty lake. The route then heads north along a pleasant country lane to Borad Hill, Hawkesbury and Church Hill before heading above the village to visit the Somerset Monument. The monument commemorates Lord Robert Somerset and sits in an elevated position just to the north west of the settlement. If you continue south along the Cotswold Way you could visit nearby Chipping Sodbury . For a longer circular walk starting from Alderley to the monument and Horton Court see the video below.",
