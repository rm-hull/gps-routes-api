  "description": "Enjoy some splendid coastal views on this walk from the village of West Bay in Dorset. The route runs for about 5 miles along fairly flat paths from West Bay to the nearby village of Burton Bradstock and Hive Beach. You'll enjoy wonderful golden cliffs and lovely beaches on this beautiful area of the Dorset coast. The walk starts from the picturesque harbour at West Bay. The area is also known as Bridport Harbour, sited at the mouth of the River Brit approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south of the town of Bridport. The area has become more recognisable as some of the ITV drama \"Broadchurch\" was filmed here. From the harbour you head east past the Bridport Golf Club to Burton Bradstock. The route passes through the village before descending to Burton Beach where you pick up a section of the South West Coast Path. You then follow this back to West Bay, passing along the lovely beaches with views of the River Bride on the way. West Bay sits at the western end of Chesil Beach. You can extend your walking in the area by heading east along the beach on the West Bay to Abbotsbury Walk where you can visit the wonderful Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens and the historic Abbotsbury Castle. Further on is the town of Weymouth and the Isle of Portland. If you head in the other direction the path will take you west to Seatown on a lovely section of the Jurassic Coast .",
