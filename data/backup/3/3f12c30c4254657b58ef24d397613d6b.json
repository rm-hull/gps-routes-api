    "description": "The Strathkelvin Railway Path is a popular cycling and walking trail running along a disused railway line from Glenboig to Strathblane. It's a beautiful area with fine views to the Campsie Fells and the Strathblane Hills as you make your way along the surfaced trail. The trail starts in Glenboig and heads north west, passing the Garnqueen Loch. You continue past Chryston before coming into Kirkintilloch where you cross the river. The trail heads north through Milton of Campsie, where there is a nice section along Glazert Water. Here you turn north west through Lennoxtown passing the Campsie Glen before coming into Strathblane. This section follows the route of the Campsie Branch of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway which was extended as the Blane Valley Railway line and closed in 1951.",
