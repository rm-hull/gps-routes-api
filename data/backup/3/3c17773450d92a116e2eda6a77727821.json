  "description": "This Kent village is located just north west of Tunbridge Wells. The thriving village is a nice place to start a walk with two major waymarked trails and a noteworthy 13th century pub to visit after your exercise. Local highlights include the 14th century Penshurst Place and Southborough Common which lies just to the east. This circular walk from the village uses part of the Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk to explore the surrounding countryside. On the way you'll visit some local walking highlights including the delightful Groombridge Place and Tunbridge Wells Common. The route starts in the village and heads south east along the waymarked footpath to Rusthall Common and Tunbridge Wells Common, where there are miles of fine walking trails to explore. You then head west along the heritage Spa Valley Railway to Friezland Wood, the old High Rocks Halt station, Harness Well Wood and the lovely Groombridge Place Gardens which are well worth exploring. Here you turn north past Langton Green to Bullingstone before turning east to return to Speldhurst.",

      "content": "The George and Dragon is a historic pub of some note. The pub is housed in a building dating back to 1212 which was originally a manor house of some importance. It is thought Kentish Archers were treated to a banquet in the Great Hall on their return from Agincourt in 1415. They serve high quality food which can be enjoyed in the charming interior or outside in the sunny garden. You can find them at postcode TN3 0NN for your sat navs."
