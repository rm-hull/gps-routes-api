  "description": "Visit one of the best preserved sections of Hadrian's Wall on this short walk in Northumberland. The walk starts at the car park near Greenhead and follows the Hadrian's Wall Path to Walltown Crags. There are splendid views towards Haltwhistle and the River South Tyne. The route also includes a waterside section along the Tipalt Burn, before passing through Greenhead and returning to the car park.",

      "content": "Head west along the Hadrian's Wall Path and you will soon come to Birdoswald Roman Fort. The fort is the most impressive of the remaining defences along the Wall today. Housesteads fort with its visitor centre and museum is a little further away to the east. If you head a few miles west along the wall there's another historic local highlight at Lanercost Priory. The English heritage run site was originally founded in 1169 as an Augustinian monastery. Today the substantial priory ruins are well worth a visit for the fascinating history and architecure. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northumberland Walks and Northumberland National Park Walks pages."
