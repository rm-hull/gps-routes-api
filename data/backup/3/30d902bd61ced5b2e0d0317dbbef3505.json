The park covers 250 acres of countryside combined with a 150 acre golf course that together form the High Elms estate, originally the country home of the Lubbock family. In the 1840's Sir John Lubbock II developed the new house and grounds in a classical Italian style with tree's collected from around the world. His son Lord Avebury was one of the foremost public figures of his day and was responsible for the Open Spaces act (1896) which enabled his former estate to be transferred to Bromley Council in 1965, as a Green Belt open space. Unfortunately the house was destroyed by fire, but some of the formal gardens survived and are still maintained. This is a model orchard in the old walled gardens."

  "description": "This circular walk from Biggin Hill explores the farmland and woodland to the north of the town. On the way you'll visit the villages of Downe and Cudham, while also exploring the lovely High Elms Country Park. The route also passes the noteworthy Down House, former residence of Charles Darwin. The town is notable as one of the highest points of Greater London, rising to over 210 metres (690 ft) above sea level. It's home to London Biggin Hill Airport and located close to the North Downs which you can explore on the North Downs Way. This route starts from the public car park at the northern end of the town. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north to Ladies Wood, Snotsdale Wood and Leasons Wood next to the West Kent Golf Club. The route continues to the pretty village of Downe which has strong associations with Charles Darwin. From Downe you head north to pick up a section of the London Loop and follow the waymarked trail east into High Elms Country Park. The popular park includes 250 acres of countryside, woodlands, a nature centre, an ice well, formal gardens and wildflower meadows. After exploring the park you head south through Cuckoo Wood before following other trails to Cudham. From Cudham you head west through Single Street before turning south west through Berry's Green. The final section takes you through Aperfield to return to Biggn Hill and the car park.",
