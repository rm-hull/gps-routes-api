    "description": "This circular walk explores the splendid Cowdray Estate in Midhurst. There's miles of trails taking you to woodland, parkland and ponds. There's also nice riverside trails along the River Rother which runs through the park. On the way look out for the ponies and horses some of which are used for the polo matches you can see on the estate. Other highlights include the ancient Queen Elizabeth tree which is between 800 and 1000 years in age. The tree is the 3rd oldest Sessile Oak in England and is so named because Queen Elizabeth 1st visited it in 1591. The walk starts from the ruins of Cowdray Castle on the eastern outskirts of Midhurst. This ruined castle dates from the early 1500s. It's heyday was during the reign of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, both of whom visited the house, with Henry VIII also being a regular visitor. This area also includes a lovely walled garden and tea room. After exploring the castle the route heads north east towards the remains of the priory before heading east to visit Steward's Pond and Benbow Pond. The later is particularly photogenic with the memorial to the Third Viscount Cowdray on the banks of the pond. The route then heads south, skirting the edge of the Heathend Copse Wood before reaching the River Rother at Ambersham Bridge. You cross the river to South Ambersham and continue west to Todham Rough before crossing the Crosters Brook and returning to the castle.",
