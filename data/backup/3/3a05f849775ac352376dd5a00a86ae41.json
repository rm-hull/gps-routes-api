  "description": "This Montmouthshire based village includes a noteworthy old castle and some pleasant trails along the River Monmow. There's also a fine 17th century pub to relax in after your exersise. This route from the village uses sections of the Three Castles Walk , other public footpaths and minor country lanes to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. On the way you'll visit Skenfrith Castle, Grosmont Castle and enjoy a climb to Edmund's Trump. The walk starts in the village where you can explore the ruins of the National Trust's Skenfrith Castle . The historic ruins date from the 13th century and are located beside the River Monnow in the village. Here you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it north towards Garway Mill on the river. The route then heads north west through the countryside and the woodland around High Meadow. You continue towards Grosmont where you cross the Tresenny Brook and arrive at another ruined castle which dates back to the 11th century. The route then heads south to Graig Syfyrddin where there are some woodland trails and a viewpoint atop Edmund's Trump. You continue south east following a mixture of footpaths and quiet country lanes towards Wayne Green. Here you can pick up the Three Castles Walk again and follow it east back to the village.",
