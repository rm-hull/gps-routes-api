  "description": "This route from Wickham uses part of the Meon Valley Trail and the waymarked King's Way to create a circular walk around the village. The walk first follows the old railway line along the River Meon before heading into the attractive countryside and woodland to the east of the village. The route starts in the village where you can pick up the Meon Valley Trail. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along the trackbed of a disused railway line. Follow the trail north to Close Wood, Kingsmead and Mislingford before coming to Soberton. This route then turns south east along the King's Way towards Hambledon (though you can follow the Meon Valley Trail into Droxford). The country paths then take you south towards Hoe Gate before diverting east to explore the Creech Wood section of the Forest of Bere near Denmead. There's a series of nice woodland trails to try here. After leaving the forest you head south west towards Boarhunt and Wickham Common before returning to the village.",

It has some history having originally been \u201cThe Old Curio Shop\u201d, an open hall timber framed building dating back to the sixteenth Century. Inside there are medieval paintings with floral/geometric patterns preserved behind glass and still on display. They do lovely home cooked food which you can enjoy in the pretty garden area if the weather is fine. You can find the pub on Wickham Square with a postcode of PO17 5JN for your sat navs."

If you continue along the Meon Valley Trail it will take you to the worthy villages of West Meon and Meonstoke. The village is located on the edge of the South Downs National Park so you can continue your walking here using the South Downs Walks page."
