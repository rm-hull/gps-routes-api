    "description": "This route from Wickham uses part of the Meon Valley Trail and the waymarked King's Way to create a circular walk around the village. The walk first follows the old railway line along the River Meon before heading into the attractive countryside and woodland to the east of the village. The route starts in the village where you can pick up the Meon Valley Trail. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along the trackbed of a disused railway line. Follow the trail north to Close Wood, Kingsmead and Mislingford before coming to Soberton. This route then turns south east along the King's Way towards Hambledon (though you can follow the Meon Valley Trail into Droxford). The country paths then take you south towards Hoe Gate before diverting east to explore the Creech Wood section of the Forest of Bere near Denmead . There's a series of nice woodland trails to try here. After leaving the forest you head south west towards Boarhunt and Wickham Common before returning to the village.",
