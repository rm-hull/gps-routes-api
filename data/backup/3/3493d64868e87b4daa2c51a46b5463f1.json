This includes 3,500 acres of former arable and dairy farmland in the grounds of the castle. This conversion of the land has lead to an abundance of new wildlife including turtle doves, barbastelle bats, slow-worms, nightingales and grass snakes."

The ditch, fed from a nearby pond, formed a moat which still contained water at the beginning of the eighteenth century."

  "description": "The Knepp Castle Estate is a fine place for walking with miles of trails to follow. There's scenic countryside with ponds, woodland, wildflowers, brooks and river views to enjoy. The area is great for wildlife too with wild boar, nesting storks, horses and deer to look out for on the way. This circular walk explores a lovely section of the estate around the ruined castle. Start the walk at the castle, located just to the west of the Worthing A road. Here you will find the remains of the 12th century medieval fortress. Follow the footpaths north west and they will take you past the large Knepmill Pond to Capp's Bridge, Shipley and King's Windmill. Shipley is an attractive old village with a noteworthy historic church and a picturesque windmill to see. Here you turn south to follow a bridle track to Hampshires Farm, Hammer Pond and Pen Bridge. You then turn east to Honeypools Barn and Swallows Farm before crossing the River Adur and returning to the castle.",
