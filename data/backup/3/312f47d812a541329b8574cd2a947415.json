  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Lough Gill in County Sligo. The walk follows a section of the Sligo Way from the village of Dromahair to the lake. You can follow the waymarked path west to the southern side of the lake, passing Cullentra Forest on the way. The path then runs along Trawane Bay using woodland trails to take you to Bunowen Bay and Slishwood. Along the way you can enjoy lovely views across the lough to its islands and the surrounding hills. Also look out for a variety of birds including breeding common terns on the lake's islands and kingfishers. To continue your walking in the area head west to Knocknarea where you can see one of Ireland's largest cairns and enjoy glorious views over the C\u00fail Irra peninsula. The photogenic Glencar Waterfall is located just to the north as well.",
