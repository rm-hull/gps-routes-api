  "description": "This area of common land is located just to the west of Coventry city centre and is a nice place for a peaceful afternoon stroll. There's a series of nice footpaths to follow to woodland, grassland and ponds. The area is also a nature reserve so you can look out for a variety of woodland birds as you make your way along the paths. The larger eastern section of the common is a large open area of mowed grass that attracts dog walkers, sunbathers and kite flyers. It is often used for fairs in the spring and summer months. Also look out for the plaque to Frank Whittle, the aerospace engineer and jet pioneer, who was born in Coventry. He was apparently inspired to pursue a career in engineering after seeing an aircraft land on Hearsall Common in 1916. Our Circular Walk Around Coventry passes through the common and also visits several of the other highlights of the city. You can follow it to the nearby War Memorial Park and then enjoy river paths along the River Sherbourne.",

The former is particularly noteworthy with its Norman church, Grade II listed 16th century inn and the Berkswell Windmill which dates back to 1826. The epic Heart of England Way can also be picked up in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
