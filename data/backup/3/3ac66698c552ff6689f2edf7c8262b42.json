    "description": "This rural village in Oxfordshire is located in the North Wessex Downs AONB and the historic Vale of White Horse near the settlements of Ardington and Wantage . The interesting village includes some historic buildings including the 15th century Hendred House and a parish church dating back to the 12th century. This circular walk from the village visits neighbouring West Hendred before heading south to The Ridgeway National Trail where you can enjoy a climb to Cuckhamsley Hill. The walk starts in the village and heads west to West Hendred, which lies less than a mile away. Here you can follow trails south to Goldbury Hill before picking up a waterside path along the Ginge Brook. This will take you to East Ginge before linking up with the Ridgeway on East Ginge Down. The route heads east to the viewpoint at the 203 metre high Cuckhamsley Hill and then continues to East Hendred Down. Here you turn north to the Meashill Plantation and Aldfield Common before returning to the village.",
