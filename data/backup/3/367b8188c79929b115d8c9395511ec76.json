  "description": "This large freshwater loch is located on the border between Perth and Kinross and the Highlands. There's nice walking and cycling trails along the loch with views across the water to several significant mountains including Ben Alder. This walk takes you along the western side of the loch and past the Ericht Forest. The walk starts from Dalwhinnie train station at the northern end of the loch. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south through the Ben Alder estate along the lochside path. The route finishes at the Ben Alder Lodge though you could continue along the path if you wish. You could also head to the west and visit the nearby Loch Pattack and enjoy a climb to the excellent viewpoint at Ben Alder. There's great views back down to the loch from this elevated position. At the southern end of the loch you can link up with the River Ericht and see the dam. The river can then be followed south to visit the nearby Loch Rannoch .",
