  "description": "This walk explores a fascinating area of the Penwith Moors SSSI in Cornwall. It's an interesting place with ancient bronze age settlements, a stone circle, the ruins of the old mining buildings and some hill climbs with tremendous views to the coast. You'll also visit Men-An-Tol standing stones and the Lanyon Quoit dolmen, two significant ancient sites on the moors. There is a roadside parking area just south east of the village of Morvah. From here you can pick up a trail heading east to Men-An-Tol. It's a very picturesque area with the stones surrounded by lovely countryside and pretty wildflowers in the summer months. The site itself consists of three upright granite stones, including an unusual round stone with its middle holed out. The walk then goes on to climb to the excellent viewpoints at Watch Croft (252m) and Carn Galver (229m), where there is a ruined mine engine house. The route then descends to visit the Nine Maidens Stone Circle at Boskednan. The megalithic monument probably consisted of 22 granite blocks, from which 10 still survive. From the stone circle you head west to visit the 19th century Greenburrow Engine House at the old Ding Dong Mine. There are great views from the photogenic ruined mine over Mounts Bay. From here you continue west and then south to visit the impressive dolmen at Lanyon Quoit. The structure originally dated from the early Neolithic period (3500-2500 BCE) but was re-erected in 1824 after collapsing in a storm in 1815. It consisits of three support stones which stand to a height of 1.5 metres. These bear a capstone which is 5.5 metres long. The Zennor Churchway and Tinners Way passes through the area. The long distance circular walk exposes you to more of the mining heritage of the area. You could follow it west towards the coast to visit Levant Mine in Pendeen. The mine is located close to the cliff edge so there's some wonderful sea views from here.",
