  "description": "This walk visits the historic Tysoe Windmill in the Stratford-on-Avon District of Warwickshire. The photogenic windmill is located just south of the village of Tysoe on top of Windmill Hill. It's a lovely spot for a walk with excellent views over the Cotswolds AONB from the 184 metre high hill. You can start the walk from Middle Tysoe and head south through Upper Tysoe. Near here you can pick up a country footpath taking you up to Windmill Hill. The route then takes you towards Compton Wynyates before returning to Tysoe on the same footpath. The southern section passes close to Compton Wynyates House, an architecturally impressive Tudor country house that is also Grade I listed.",
