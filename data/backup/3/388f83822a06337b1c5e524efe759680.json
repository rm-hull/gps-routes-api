  "description": "This Nottinghamshire based market town is well positioned for exploring the countryside of the River Trent Valley. This easy walk in the town centre takes you along the Linear Walk. The walk runs along a nice surfaced path through a local nature reserve and along a disused railway line. Along the way you will pass the old Bingham Road Station which closed back in the 1950s. There's also old rail bridges, countryside paths and views of the River Smite at the south eastern end of the route. Habitats on the path include woodland, mature trees, scrub and grassland. There's also lots of interesting plants, flowers and wildlife to see, particularly in the warmer months. The first section of the footpath is quite sheltered and shady before coming out into more open countryside with wider views. To continue your walking around Bingham head north to pick up the Trent Valley Way . The waymarked long distance trail will take you along a pleasant section of the river around Gunthorpe .",
