The line was built in order to facilitate the transport of sea sand for agricultural use from the estuary of the Camel to the local farms, and never carried passengers. Other traffic included granite and china clay from local quarries, and the line survived to carry the latter until 1983. Today the route of the line forms part of the Camel Trail, a recreational route for walkers, cyclists and horse riders"

  "description": "This Cornish town sits in a lovely spot in the River Camel Valley, close to Bodmin Moor. This walk from the town follows the Camelford Way south to the nearby village of Blisland where you can link up with the popular Camel Trail. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Camelford Way long distance walking trail which is marked on the OS map below. Follow the trail south and it will take you to Valley Truckle, Tresinney and the site of the medieval village of Carwether. You continue south to Tuckingmill, Lamphill Woods and St Breward where there are nice views of the River Camel. You'll pass Wenford Dries before turning east to Blisland where the walk finishes. Here you can enjoy some well earned refreshment at the noteworthy Blisland Inn. The award winning pub is a great place for connoisseurs of real ale, having been voted three times Cornwall CAMRA Pub of the Year and in 2001 becoming the campaign's national Pub of the Year. Near here the route links up with the Camel Trail, a shared cycling and walking path which runs along a disused railway line to Padstow.",
