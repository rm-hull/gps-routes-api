  "description": "This Welsh town has some nice trails though the Ely Valley and some fine local hill climbs to try. It's located in the county of Rhondda Cynon Taf, on the\u00a0River Ely\u00a0and the\u00a0Afon Clun. Llantrisant is also notable as being the home of the\u00a0Royal Mint, a government-owned\u00a0mint\u00a0that produces coins for the United Kingdom. This walk from the town follows the waymarked Glamorgan Ridgeway Walk walk to Llantrisant Forest, Mynydd Garth Maelwg and Mynydd Meiros to the west. There's some nice peaceful woodland trails, river crossings and splendid views from the high points on the ridge. The walk starts in the town and follows the Ffordd Bryniau and Glamorgan Ridgeway walk west past Talbot Green and the River Ely and into Llantrisant Forest. The trail then heads up to Mynydd Meiros where there are some excellent views over the surrounding hills and countryside. The route then turns around to follow alternative paths through the forest.",
