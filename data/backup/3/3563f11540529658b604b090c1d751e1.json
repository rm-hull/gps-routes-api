  "description": "This Welsh village is located on the north of the Gower Peninsula. The area is great for walking with coastal paths along the Loughor Estuary where you can look out for a wide variety of wading birds. The village is famous for its centuries old cockle industry with the cockles sold all over the world. This walk takes you along a section of the Wales Coast Path to Llanrhidian. On the way there's fine views of the Loughor estuary and the Llanrhidian Marsh. You'll pass Dalton's Point and the village of Crofty which lie just to the west of the settlement. Here you can enjoy fine views from Saltmarsh Point.",
