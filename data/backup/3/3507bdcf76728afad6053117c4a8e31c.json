  "description": "Enjoy a stroll along this pleasant section of the Wilts and Berks Canal in Swindon. The walk starts in the town centre and follows the canal towpath to West Leaze Farm. On the way you'll pass the River Ray and the Rushey Platt Nature Reserve where you can look out for the water-vole. The canal runs on to Melksham via Wootton Bassett and Chippenham. Near Chippenham there is a section of the National Cycle Network running from Pewsham to Lacock Abbey. You can see this on the video below. To extend your walk you could try our Swindon Canal Circular Walk and visit the nearby Lawns Park and Queen's Park.",
