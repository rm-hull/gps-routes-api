  "description": "This pretty little village sits in a lovely spot close to the Dorset coast, near Swanage. This circular walk from the village visits some of the local highlights including Dancing Ledge, Worth Matravers and St Aldhelm's Chapel. The walk starts in the village and heads south through the countryside towards Dancing Ledge on the coast. Here you turn west along the South West Coast Path to Seacombe Cliff and the ancient St Aldhelm's Chapel. You then turn north to Emmetts Hill before turning east on country lanes to the neighbouring village of Worth Matravers. The final section takes you east along the Priest's Way to return to the village.",
