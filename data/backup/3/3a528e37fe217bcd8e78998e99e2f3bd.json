  "description": "A waterside walk along the Grand Union Canal starting from the village of Knowle near Solihull. It's a lovely section of the canal, taking you from the Grade I listed Grimshaw Hall in Knowle, to the moated manor house at Baddesley Clinton. The walk is just over 10 miles, taking in some lovely Warwickshire countryside, pretty locks, and two historical buildings. You can start the walk from the car park on Hampton Road just to the north east of Knowle village. From here you can access the towpath of the canal which you follow south to Knowle Locks. Here you will pass a flight of five locks (originally six until around 1930) near the canal bridge on Kenilworth Road. You continue south to Kingswood where you pick up the Heart of England Way to take you to Baddesley Clinton. In the grounds you will find woodland trails, a lake, bluebells in the adjacent Hay Wood and a walled garden with flower borders and fruit trees. After exploring the estate the route returns to the canal and heads back to Knowle the same way. At Kingswood the Grand Union Canal meets with the Stratford Upon Avon Canal so you can continue your waterside walking here. You could also continue south along the Grand Union Canal and visit Warwick.",
