  "description": "This walk explores the Lancaut Peninsula in the Wye Valley AONB. It's a scenic and historic place situated around the abandoned medieval village of Lancaut. The area includes a pleasant riverside walk and some interesting old ruined buildings including the ancient Lancaut Church. The trail runs for about 2 miles from Lancaut to Chepstow, passing the 12th century Lancaut church ruins, Woodcroft Quarry and the wonderful viewpoint at Wintour's Leap on the way. The route finishes in Chepstow where you can visit the historic castle. Lancaut is also a designated nature reserve so there's lots of birdlife and interesting flora to see on the way. Keep your eyes peeled for peregrine falcon, raven, cormorant and herons in the river area.",
