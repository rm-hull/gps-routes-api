    "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this large forest near Gateshead . There's 360-hectares of mixed woodland to explore on a variety of waymarked paths. Walkers can try four trails of varying lengths and difficulty. These include an easy walk along the Old Railway Footpath which takes you through the heart of the forest on a well surfaced path. There are also longer, more challenging trails around the boundary of the forest and a riverside walk along the River Derwent. Look out for a number of woodland sculptures including the popular Chopwell 'hands'. It's great for mountain biking too with a number of blue graded trails and one fast technical red grade trail. To extend your walking in the area, head towards Stanley and visit the oldest surviving single-arch railway bridge in the world at Causey Arch . The site includes a lovely woodland gorge, interesting geology and views of the Tanfield Heritage Railway which runs through the area.",
