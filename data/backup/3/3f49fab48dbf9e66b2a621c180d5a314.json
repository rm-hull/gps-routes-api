  "description": "This walk climbs to Slieve Croob in the Dromara Hills area of the Mourne Mountains  in County Down. You can start your walk from the car parking area on Dree Hill, to the west of Slieve Croob. The route then follows a winding tarmac path east to the hill summit which stands at a height of 534 metres (1,752 ft). Here you will find an ancient burial cairn and several transmitter stations with radio masts. There's wonderful views towards Lough Neagh and beyond to the Sperrin mountains to enjoy at the top. You can also see down to Lisburn and along the Lagan Valley to Belfast . You can continue your walking in the area by heading east to explore the peaceful woodland trails in Drumkeeragh Forest . To the north east there's Ballynahinch and the splendid Montalto Estate as well.",
