  "description": "This long distance walk through South Devon follows the John Musgrave Heritage Trail from Maidencombe to Brixham. The route was created in memory of John Musgrave, a keen walker and  former chairman of the South Devon Ramblers. The walk is well signposted and includes information boards where you can learn all about the interesting history of the area. You start off on the coast at the little village of Maidencombe just south of Shaldon and north of Torquay. The trail then heads through Watcombe, Kingskerswell and Cockington on the edge of Torbay. Here you can explore Cockington Country Park where there's hundreds of acres of parkland with ornamental lakes, woodlands and formal gardens. You continue west to Totnes, passing the historic Berry Pomeroy Castle on the way. Here the route turns south following a section of the Dart Valley Trail along the River Dart towards Ashprington, Cornworthy and Dittisham. A ferry will take you to opposite side of the river before heading east through the countryside to finish on the coast at Brixham. Here you can extend the walk to visit the nearby Berry Head Country Park where there are some splendid sea views.",
