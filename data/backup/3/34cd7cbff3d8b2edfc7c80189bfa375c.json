  "description": "This is a nice easy short walk or cycle along the disused London and South Western Railway Ilfracombe Branch Line, from Ilfracombe to Mortehoe and Woolacombe railway station. The route starts off by the pier in Ilfracombe and soon joins the railway path on the outskirts of the town. It then heads south passing Slade Reservoirs while giving a great view of the beautiful surrounding countryside. The route follows National Cycle Route 27 for the duration and with most of it traffic free it's a good choice for families.",

It also visits the woodland trails in the Borough Valley between Lee and Ossaborough. From Ilfracombe you can catch a boat to the beautiful Lundy Island. The island is owned by the National Trust and has some splendid coastal walking trails. It's also a nature reserve with lots of wildlife to see, including the famous Lundy puffins. For more walking ideas in the area see the Exmoor Walks and North Devon Coast Walks pages."
