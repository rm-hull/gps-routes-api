  "description": "Enjoy miles of well laid out cycling and walking trails in this lovely country park in Dundee. The route starts by taking you around the large reservoir on the waterside path. Look out for a variety of birdlife including Pochard, Goldeneye, Tufted Ducks, Moorhen, and Coot. The route then heads into the peaceful Templeton Woods where you can look out for red squirrels. If you would like to continue your outing you could visit the adjacent Camperdown Park where you will find another 400 acres of pretty parkland and a Wildlife Centre.",
