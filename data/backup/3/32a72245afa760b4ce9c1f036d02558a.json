It closed as an industrial line in 1969, but was taken over by volunteers to be run as a heritage railway."

  "description": "This Bedfordshire based market town is located close to a canal, two fine country parks and the Chiltern Hills AONB. The interesting town also includes a 13th century church and a popular heritage railway. This walk from the town visits some of the highlights of the area including the Grand Union Canal, Rushmere Country Park the Greensand Ridge, Stockgrove Country Park and the River Ouzel. The walk starts on the canal, just to the west of the town centre. Follow the towpath north and it will take you to Leighton Lock, the Swing Bridge and Old Linslade Manor. Near here you leave the canal to head north east towards Rushmere Country Park. Here you'll find miles of woodland walking trails and several pretty ponds. There's also Stockgrove Country Park where there's a nice lakeside trail. After exploring the park you pick up a section of the Greensand Ridge Walk to take you along the River Ouzel around Rushmere. The route then returns to the canal to follow the towpath south back to Leighton.",
