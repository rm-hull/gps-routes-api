  "description": "This circular walk climbs to these two distinctive hills near Dorchester. On the way you can enjoy wonderful views over the Oxfordshire and Berkshire countryside. The 'clumps' include Round Hill at 390 feet (120 m) and the 350 feet (110 m) Castle Hill which is about 380 yards (350 m) to the south-east. The Clumps are one of the most visited outdoor sites in Oxfordshire, attracting over 200,000 visitors a year. You can park at the Wittenham Clumps car park right next to the hills to start your walk. Then follow the footpaths up to Round Hill where you can enjoy panoramic views, overlooking some of the villages and towns which mark some of the first settlements of the English. A viewpoint guide at the hilltop displays some of the features of interest you can see from the summit. These include significant locks on the River Thames, Faringdon Folly , Didcot Power Station and Dorchester Abbey. On a clear day there's also great views of the Chiltern Hills and Cotswold Hills. After taking in the views from Round Hill you can make your way over to Castle Hill which is the site of an Iron Age Hillfort. Excavations of the site suggest it was occupied since the Bronze Age around 1000 BC. Artefacts recovered include an oval bronze shield and the Wittenham Sword and scabbard, dating from the late Iron Age. Just to the north of the hill you will find Little Wittenham Woods where you can extend your walk on the woodland trails next to the river. You can also continue your walk along the Thames Path which runs near to the hills. Heading south will take you to Wallingford where you can visit the ruins of the 11th century Wallingford Castle and enjoy more riverside paths. You can also try our longer Dorchester Circular Walk which visits the clumps, Shillingford and Dorchester Abbey. The Clumps can be reached from the nearby town of Didcot on our Didcot Walk .",
