  "description": "This walk visits the RSPB'S Strumpshaw Fen Nature Reserve in the Norfolk Broads, west of Strumpshaw village. The reserve is located just east of Brundall and includes a number of pleasant footpaths with lots of birdlife to look out for. There's much to enjoy with riverside paths along the River Yare and some pretty lakes and pools on Strumpshaw Marsh. Keep your eyes peeled for a large variety of wildlife including Bittern, Cetti's Warbler, Marsh Harrier and Kingfisher. Habitats at the site include reedbeds, woodlands and orchid-rich meadows. To continue your nature reserve walking in the area head west to visit the RSPB Church Marsh Nature Reserve at nearby Surlingham on the edge of the lovely Surlingham Broad. Here you can also pick up the Bramerton Riverside Walk and visit the popular Water's Edge Pub with its riverside decking area.",

It's a lovely place for a stroll with carpets of snowdrops in Ferbruary and lots of bluebells in the spring months. There's also the interesting ancient ruins of the 14th century St Peter church to see here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Broads Walks page."
