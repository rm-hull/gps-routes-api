  "description": "Explore over 100 acres of parkland on this short walk in Bradford. The park includes a car park, visitor centre, gift shop and countryside centre. There's also a nice nature trail running for about 2 miles through parkland, gardens and woodland. On the trail you can look out for a wide variety of interesting plants and wildflowers. Keep your eyes peeled for butterflies and birds too. The park surrounds the historic Oakwell Hall which was built by John Batt in 1583 and is now contains an interesting museum. Visitors to the hall include Charlotte Bronte who featured it as 'Fieldhead' in her classic novel Shirley. The Spen Way Heritage Trail and Bronte Way, Leeds Country Way and Kirklees Way walking routes run through or just past the park so you could continue your exercise on one of these long distance trails. The trails will take you through the countryside to Birkenshaw, Batley, Liversedge and Cleck Heaton. See the maps below for details.",

The Pudsey Walk visits the pretty Pudsey Beck before climbing to the fine viewpoint at Post Hill in Troydale. On the south western outskirts of the city there's Horton Bank Country Park to visit. The pleasant park includes a nice lakeside trail and a viewpoint with fine views over the city and the surrounding Yorkshire Dales. The picturesque Chellow Dene Reservoir is also located near here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks page."
