  "description": "This circular walk explores the Dersingham Bog Site of Special Scientific Interest in North Norfolk. The nature reserve is part of the wider Sandringham Royal Estate and includes attractive heathland with interesting flora and fauna to see. Keep your eyes peeled for Nightjar, woodlark and tree pipit as you make your way around the expansive site. Flora on the reserve includes pretty heather and woodland with Scots pine, oak, sweet chestnut, sycamore and birch. The site is notable as being one of the few remaining wilderness areas in this part of the county. You can start the walk from the car park just south east of Wolferton village and west of Sandringham Country Park. You can then pick up series of footpaths and boardwalks taking you around the bog. The walk can be extended by heading to Dersingham Common which lies just to the east of the bog on the outskirts of the village. In the village you will find The Church of St Nicholas which is well worth a visit. It is a Grade I listed building and includes the elaborately carved wooden parish chest, dating from the middle of the 14th century. For more information on the site see the wikipedia page .",
