  "description": "A circular walk from Wombourne taking you along a dismantled railway line before returning along the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. The route follows a section of the old Wolverhampton to Dudley railway line which now forms part of the South Staffordshire Railway Walk. The line was closed in 1965 but is now a leisure route suitable for walkers and cyclists. On the way you'll also pass the old Bratch pumping station and the impressive Bratch Locks, originally built as a staircase. It's a lovely spot and ideal for a picnic or gentle stroll. The walk starts from the Wombourne Railway cafe where there is a car park. It's located just to the north of the town centre, next to Bratch Bridge. From here you can pick up the waymarked railway path and follow it north past Orton and Lower Penn to Mops Farm Bridge. Here you meet up with the canal and follow it south past some pretty lakes and locks to Awbridge Farm. You then pass Clee View before crossing the bridge and returning to the car park.",

This visits the pretty Belvide Reservoir and the Georgian country house of Chillington Hall with its Capability Brown landscaped park and lake. The noteworthy Weston Park is also located just west of Belvide Reservoir and north west of Chillington Hall. There's more than 1000 acres of landscaped parkland surrounding this 17th century country mansion. A couple of miles east of Wombourne there's Baggeridge Country Park. The park has woodland trails and a decent viewpoint with fine views over the area. Adjacent to the park there's also the 18th century Himley Hall. The historic hall is surrounded by \u2018Capability\u2019 Brown landscaped parkland with woodland walks, waterfalls and a large lake. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
