The Zetland pub (off the picture to the left) and many houses are built on this. The beach huts also begin here. I have used 'public house gardens' as a category for this rather loosely. That is normally where such benches are to be found."

    "description": "A popular circular walk along the Kent coast from the village of Kingsdown to St Margaret's Bay. The route runs along a section of the Saxon Shore Way and the White Cliffs Country Trails , two long distance trails running through the area. It's just over 6 miles along beach side paths and cliff tops before returning on an inland bridle path to return to Kingsdown. The walk starts at the Zetland Arms pub on the front in Kingsdown, just south of Deal. From here you can pick up the waymarked trails and follow them south along the shingle beach to Hope Point and Coney Burrow Point. Here you climb up to the cliff top for some excellent views over the area. The route then descends to St Margaret's Bay where you can enjoy some refreshments at the cafe. The route then heads to St Margaret's at Cliffe village. Here you pick up footpaths and bridle tracks to take you north along the western side of the golf course. There's more nice views here before descending back into Kingsdown. *to bay from k",
