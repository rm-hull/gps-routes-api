  "description": "This historic market town in Leicestershire,\u00a0is located near the National Forest , just north of East Midlands Airport. The attractive town includes a number of Tudor houses and a noteworthy 13th century church. This walk from the town heads east to visit Hemington, Daleacre Hill and Lockington. There's some nice countryside views and some interesting old buildings to see in the nearby villages. The walk starts on the northern side of the town where you can pick up footpaths heading east past the remains of the old 13th century castle to the neighbouring village of Hemington. You continue east past Daleacre Hill to Lockington where you can see Lockington Hall. The hall is Grade II listed and dates from the 17th century. You then pick up Church Lane and follow it west back to Hemington. You'll pass the ruins of the old chapel which has not been used since the 16th century. From here you retrace your steps to Castle Donington.",
