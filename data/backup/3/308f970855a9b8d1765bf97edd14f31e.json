  "description": "This Monmouthshire based village is close to a major canal and the wonderful scenery of the Brecon Beacons National Park. This walk from the village follows a section of the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal south to the lovely Goytre Wharf. The walk starts in the village and heads south to link up with the canal towpath at Llanfoist Wharf. Follow it south and it will take you past Llanellen and Upper Llanover before coming to the picturesque wharf. The area is one of the highlights on the canal with a good sized car park, boat hire, heritage centre and on site cafe.",
