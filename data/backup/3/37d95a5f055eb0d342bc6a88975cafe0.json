  "description": "A circular walk along the River Llugy and the River Conwy in the Snowdonia village of Betws Y Coed. The short walk takes you along footpaths where the two rivers converge, close to the train station and the village centre. You can start the walk from the Snowdonia National Park Visitor Centre or from the train station. Paths will then take you around the golf course and along the rushing waters of the rivers. There's nice views across the water to the surrounding woodland and mountains of the area. You can continue your riverside walking by following the Afon Llugy west and visiting the delightful Swallow Falls and the picturesque wooden Miners Bridge . Also nearby are the Conwy Falls where there are good trails to follow along the River Conwy. To the south is the delightful Fairy Glen where there's little waterfalls, rapids and cascades in a picturesque wooded gorge.",
