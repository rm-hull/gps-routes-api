  "description": "This West Yorkshire town is located close to Leeds and Wakefield. The Leeds Country Way long distance trail passes the town providing an opportunity for walkers to explore the woodland and countryside of the area. This walk from the town follows a section of the Leeds Country Way and the Kirklees Way to Ardsley Reservoir at West Ardsley, just south of the town. You can pick up the waymarked footpath to the west of the town at Bruntclife. Follow the path south past Birkby Brow Wood and along the Howley Beck to Upper Bartley. The route continues south east past Howley Hall Golf Course to West Ardsley and the reservoir. There's a nice circular waterside path to follow around the lake with good views of the surrounding countryside. For more details on the history, buildings and transport links in the town see the informative wikipedia page.",
