  "description": "This popular walk runs between this two lovely villages in the Northumberland Coast AONB. It's about a 3 mile walk along a section of the Northumberland Coast Path, so 6 miles there and back. The route takes place on a fairly flat section of the St Oswald's Way long distance trail. There's pretty harbours, lovely beaches and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Seahouses is a working fishing port, which also serves the tourist trade, being the embarkation point for visits to the Farne Islands. The route starts at Seahouses Harbour and heads towards North Sunderland Point. You continue south towards the golf course, the pretty Annstead Burn and Annstead Beach. The route passes alongside the lovely beach where you will find attractive sand dunes and wildlflowers such as Dog Rose and Marram Grass. You soon come to Beadnell, passing the village, before finishing at the harbour where you can enjoy great views across Beadnell Bay. To extend the route you can continue on the Beadnell to Low Newton Walk. This includes a visit to the National Trust owned Newton Pool Nature Reserve. Head north  along the St Oswalds Way and you can visit the dramatic Bamburgh Castle on the Seahouses to Bamburgh Walk .",
