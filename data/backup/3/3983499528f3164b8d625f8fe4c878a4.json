    "description": "A circular walk around Dunbar visiting the sandstone cliff top trail, John Muir House, Dunbar Harbour and the interesting town centre. The route runs for just over 3 miles on generally easy paths with wonderful views from the coastal trail. The walk starts from the Victoria Harbour and heads west toward Belhaven Bay, passing Winterfield Park, Winterfield Golf Course and Dunbar Castle. You can still see the ruins of one of the strongest fortresses in Scotland, situated in a prominent position overlooking the harbour. After passing round the golf course you follow a road back into Dunbar where you will come to John Muir's Birthplace. The well known naturalist and preservationist, was born in the house at 126 High Street on 21 April 1838.  Inside, you will find three floors of family friendly interactive displays giving you the opportunity to accompany John Muir on the journey of his life, from a boyhood exploring East Lothian's rugged coastline and gently rolling farmland to adventures in the pristine wilderness of the American frontier. There's also the Old Town House with its striking sun dials and museum and gallery. Here you can find out all about the interesting history of the town. This route uses a section of the John Muir Way long distance path for the coastal section. You could extend your walk by continuing west along the trail to the lovely Belhaven Bay and John Muir Country Park . In the park there's lovely beaches and a wide variety of plantlife and birdlife to look out for. Also nearby is Pressmennan Wood which has 200 acres of woodland trails and a pretty lake.",
