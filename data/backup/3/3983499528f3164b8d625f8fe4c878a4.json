  "description": "A circular walk around Dunbar visiting the sandstone cliff top trail, John Muir House, Dunbar Harbour and the interesting town centre. The route runs for just over 3 miles on generally easy paths with wonderful views from the coastal trail. The walk starts from the Victoria Harbour and heads west toward Belhaven Bay, passing Winterfield Park, Winterfield Golf Course and Dunbar Castle. You can still see the ruins of one of the strongest fortresses in Scotland, situated in a prominent position overlooking the harbour. After passing round the golf course you follow a road back into Dunbar where you will come to John Muir's Birthplace. The well known naturalist and preservationist, was born in the house at 126 High Street on 21 April 1838. Inside, you will find three floors of family friendly interactive displays giving you the opportunity to accompany John Muir on the journey of his life, from a boyhood exploring East Lothian's rugged coastline and gently rolling farmland to adventures in the pristine wilderness of the American frontier. There's also the Old Town House with its striking sun dials and museum and gallery. Here you can find out all about the interesting history of the town. This route uses a section of the John Muir Way long distance path for the coastal section. You could extend your walk by continuing west along the trail to the lovely Belhaven Bay and John Muir Country Park. In the park there's lovely beaches and a wide variety of plantlife and birdlife to look out for. Also nearby is Pressmennan Wood which has 200 acres of woodland trails and a pretty lake.",

      "content": "Head west from the town and you can try the Haddington to Longniddry Railway Walk. This easy 5 mile walk takes you along a dismantled railway line, running between these two East Lothian Towns. Just to the south of the town you can enjoy a walk up to the Dunbar Bear. The large bear sculpture celebrates the life of the locally born John Muir, known as the father of national parks. Head into nearby Dirleton and you could try the interesting Dirleton Solar Walk. The educational walk will take you along a wonderful scale model of the Solar System with some splendid countryside views to enjoy too."
