  "description": "This large area of coniferous woodland is located a few miles south of Hexham. There's miles of nice wide trails suitable for mountain bikers or walkers. In the forest you'll find a mixture of spruce, pine and larch trees with lots of wildlife to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for nightjar and red squirrels as you make your way through the woods. There's also a sculpture trail at the eastern side of the woods. To the east of the woods you will find the noteworthy Slalely Hall. The Edwardian mansion is now a hotel set in 1000 acres of beautiful grounds. In the grounds there are Japanese Gardens, wide lawns and wonderful views of the surrounding countryside. The forest is located very close to Pow Hill Country Park and Derwent Reservoir which is a great place to extend your exercise. There's a nice walking trail along the reservoir and the circular Derwent Reservoir Cycle Route. The long distance Weardale Way also passes right through the forest. You could pick it up and head south to the delightful village of Blanchland on the River Derwent.",
