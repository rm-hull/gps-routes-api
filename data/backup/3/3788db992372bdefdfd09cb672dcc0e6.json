  "description": "This forest near Newport has a series of good cycling and walking trails to try. There's lots of wildlife to see in the area with red squirrels and a variety of woodland birds. Look out for garden warbler, nightjar, woodcock, green, great spotted woodpecker and long eared owl as you make your way along the paths. For cyclists there are mostly flat paths with a few hills and jumps for mountain bikers to try. The forest is composed of mainly mixed coniferous and deciduous woodland. You can start your outing from the public car park at the south eastern corner of the woods at a postcode of PO30 5LZ for your sat navs. It's located just to the north west of Newport town centre. To continue your woodland walking on the island head to Brighstone Forest. Brighstone is the largest forest on the island with Parkhurst the second largest. At the site there's some excellent coastal views from a couple of hills located in and around the forest.",

      "content": "To continue your walking from Newport you could pick up any one of multiple waymarked trails. The popular Tennyson Trail will take you from Newport to Alum Bay via Brighstone, Freshwater and Tennyson Down. The Bembridge Trail runs to Bembridge, passing the delightful village of Brading on the way. The Stenbury Trail runs to Appuldurcombe, Stenbury and Week Downs before finishing at the delightful Ventnor botanic gardens on the coast. The Red Squirrel Trail also passes through Newport. This long distance cycle route explores some of the most attractive countryside and coast on the island. The National Trust's Mottistone Manor lies just south of Brighstone Forest. Here you'll find beautiful gardens and bluebell woods in the grounds surrounding this historic Elizabethan manor house. To the west there's Newtown where you'll find a delightful village with a wildlife rich National Nature Reserve and an interesting local history. For more walking ideas in the area see the Isle of Wight Walks page."
