  "description": "This forest near Newport has a series of good cycling and walking trails to try. There's lots of wildlife to see in the area with red squirrels and a variety of woodland birds. Look out for garden warbler, nightjar, woodcock, green, great spotted woodpecker and long eared owl as you make your way along the paths. For cyclists there are mostly flat paths with a few hills and jumps for mountain bikers to try. The forest is composed of mainly mixed coniferous and deciduous woodland. You can start your outing from the public car park at the south eastern corner of the woods at a postcode of PO30 5LZ for your sat navs. It's located just to the north west of Newport town centre. To continue your woodland walking on the island head to Brighstone Forest. Brighstone is the largest forest on the island with Parkhurst the second largest. At the site there's some excellent coastal views from a couple of hills located in and around the forest.",
