  "description": "This area of heathland and woodland in Norwich, has miles of nice footpaths to try. It's located just to the north east of the city centre and train station. You can park at the car park on Gurney Road to start your walk. From here you can pick up trails heading along the heath on both sides of the road. The common is elevated above the city so there are fine views towards the Norwich skyline. You can clearly see landmarks such as the cathedral, the city hall and the castle from here. To extend the walk you could climb to St James Hill at the south eastern corner of the heath, for more nice views. The heath is also a nature reserve so you can look out for a variety of flora and fauna on your walk. Keep your eyes peeled for frogs around the Vinegar Pond and muntjac and roe deer, red fox and rabbits on the heath and in the woods. There's lots of pretty wildflowers to see in the summer including Trailing St John's-wort and Bell Heather. To continue your walking round the town pick up the popular Norwich Riverside Walk. You could also visit the nearby Whitlingham Country Park where you will find the lovely Whitlingham Broads.",
