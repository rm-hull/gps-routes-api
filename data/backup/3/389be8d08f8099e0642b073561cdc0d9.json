  "description": "This popular riverside walk takes you from Eastleigh to Winchester along a section of the Itchen Way. It's about a 7 mile walk on a gently rising, well maintained footpath. You can start the walk from the train station in Eastleigh and head east to join with the river and the waymarked footpath. The trail then heads north to Otterbourne and Shawford before coming to St Catherine's Hill on the southern outskirts of Winchester. You could take a small detour to climb the hill for some wonderful views over the city and the Itchen Valley. After passing the hill you will soon come into the city centre where the route finishes at the historic cathedral. In Winchester you can extend the walk by paying a visit to the lovely Winnall Moors Nature Reserve. The reserve is a great place for wildlife spotting with otters and kingfishers to look out for.",
