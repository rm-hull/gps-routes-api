  "description": "This walk explores the beautiful Teign Valley, following the River Teign from its source on Dartmoor to Shaldon on the Devon coast. It's a splendid riverside trail with lots of pretty villages and great scenery to enjoy. The walk starts at the car park in Postbridge, just to the north of Bellever Forest in Dartmoor. The pretty village includes the famous old clapper bridge. The ancient bridge was built in the 13th century to enable pack horses to cross the river, carrying tin to the stannary town of Tavistock. From here you head north to Gidleigh passing Fernworthy Reservoir, Fernworthy Forest, Chagford Common and Scorhill Down where you will pass the impressive Scorhill Stone Circle. From Gidleigh you head east towards Chagford and then on to the splendid Fingle Woods and Castle Drogo at Drewsteignton. This is a lovely section of the river which includes the iconic Fingle Bridge and the Iron Age Hill Fort of Wooston Castle. If you have time visit Castle Drogo and try the Hunters Path which gives great views of the river gorge below. From Fingle Woods you continue east towards Dunsford, passing through a series of woods including Cod Wood, Dunsford Wood and Bridford Wood. These areas include nature reserves where you can look out for interesting flora and fauna by the river. At Dunsford the route starts to turn to the south, passing Doddiscombleigh, Lower Ashton and Trusham before arriving at Chudleigh Knighton. You continue south to Newton Abbot passing Stover Country Park and the Stover Canal on the way. The route then turns east to take you along the Teign Estuary to the finish point at Shaldon, near Teignmouth on the coast. It's a lovely final section with lots of birdlife to look out for on the estuary. You can see a nice view of this on the google street view link below.",
