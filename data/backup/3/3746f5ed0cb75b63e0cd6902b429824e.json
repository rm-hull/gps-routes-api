The village is an example of 19th century planning of housing consisting of thatched cottages and a village school around a newly created green. When Samuel Morton Peto took over the Somerleyton Estate in 1844 he began to reconstruct the Hall and to replan the village as a model village in the spirit of the times. The main road was diverted through the village which became centred on the village green, a horse-shoe shaped area with new houses around the perimeter, the school at one end and the village pump at the other. The new houses were designed by John Thomas, the architect of Somerleyton Hall. Peto also brought the railway to the village."

    "description": "The Waveney Valley is a wonderful place for waterside walking. With rivers, broads, nature reserves and several picture postcard villages it's the ideal place for easy walking on flat footpaths. This walk through the valley visits some of the highlights of the area. Starting at Beccles you'll first follow the Angles Way along the River Waveney to Oulton Broad and Carlton Marshes in Lowestoft . The route then continues to Somerleyton before finishing at Fritton Lake Country Park . The walk starts at the public car park at the northern end of Beccles, just north of the train station. From here you can pick up the Angles Way and follow the waymarked footpath north along the river to Aldeby Hall. The route continues east to Castle Marsh before coming to Oulton Broad on the western outskirts of Lowestoft. The broad and nature reserve are an excellent place for birdwatching with several species visiting the water. You continue north past Flixton Marshes to Somerleyton. It's a very pretty village which includes the historic Somerleyton Hall. The hall has a fascinating history and is surrounded by beautiful gardens. There's also train station here and at Lowestoft so you can finish the walk early and return on the train to Beccles if you prefer. This route continues north to visit Fritton Lake Country Park near St Olaves. Here you'll find the expansive Fritton Lake surrounded by peaceful woodland trails.",
