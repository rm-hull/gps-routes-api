It flows for about 8 miles or 13 km in a generally southeastern direction. In the centre of Coventry it flows through Spon End (where it is spanned by Vignoles Bridge) and it is culverted just before it reaches the Inner Ring Road and Spon Street, and continues through the suburb of Whitley. It joins the River Sowe (a tributary of the River Avon) south of the A45 road near Baginton."

  "description": "This waymarked trail follows the Sherbourne River through the city of Coventry and the surrounding countryside. The walk starts just south of the city and heads north through Coventry before emerging into the countryside and finishing at Corley Moor. Here the trail links with the Coventry Way so it's easy to continue your walk if you have time. On the way there's some pleasant waterside stretches and lovely views of the surrounding hills and countryside.",
