  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the Beacon Hill viewpoint in the grounds of Highclere Castle in Hampshire. Start the walk from the car park at Old Burghclere, just to the south east of the castle. From here you can pick up a footpath heading west up to the hill top. This includes some steps to begin with before coming to a more open section leading to the 261 metre high summit. Here you will find the remains of an ancient Iron Age hut circle with splendid views over the Hampshire and Berkshire countryside. You can follow a circular footpath around the ramparts before descending back to the car park. The hill is not to be confused with the Beacon Hill Nature Reserve in Meonstoke which is also in Hampshire but some way to the south.",

      "content": "The hill lies just south of the expansive Highclere Estate. The house here is famous as the location of period drama 'Downton Abbey'. The estate includes miles of footpaths taking you to woodland, parkland and gardens. Head south from the hill and you could pick up the Wayfarer's Walk. If you follow the waymarked trail east it will take you to one of the highlights of the area at Watership Down. The hill was made famous by Richard Adams' 1972 novel and the subsequent animated film."
