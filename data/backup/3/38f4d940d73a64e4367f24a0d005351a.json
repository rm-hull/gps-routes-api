  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Wet Sleddale Reservoir near Penrith in Cumbria. You can start the walk from the car park at the eastern end of the reservoir, next to the dam. Then pick up footpaths heading west to Sleddale Hall. Film buffs may recognise this as the location of Crow Crag from the 1987 fillm 'Withnail and I' starring Richard E Grant. You then follow trails east to Bowfield and Thorney Bank before crossing the River Lowther. Quiet country lanes will then take you west back to the car park.",
