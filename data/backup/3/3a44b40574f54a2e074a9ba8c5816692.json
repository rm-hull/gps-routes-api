It may never happen now due to the traffic being routed around by the M9 spur. This should remain green belt land."

  "description": "This walk visits the Cammo Estate Nature Reserve on the north western fringes of the city of Edinburgh. The historic park is a lovely place for a walk with a number of trails taking you to pretty pools, a walled garden, wildflower meadows, old ruins and the striking 19th century Cammo Tower. The peaceful park is a great place for wildlife with deer, foxes, owls and other birds of prey to look out for. You can start the walk from the car park at the south eastern end next to Cammo Walk Road.",
