It may never happen now due to the traffic being routed around by the M9 spur. This should remain green belt land."

The historic park is a lovely place for a walk with a number of trails taking you to pretty pools, a walled garden, wildflower meadows, old ruins and the striking 19th century Cammo Tower. The peaceful park is a great place for wildlife with deer, foxes, owls and other birds of prey to look out for.
