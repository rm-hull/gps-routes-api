  "description": "This circular walk around the city centre of Norwich follows the lovely riverside path along the River Wensum.  The walk starts near the forum in the centre of Norwich where parking is available. You could also start at the train station as the river is just a short distance away. There is a path on both sides of the river for most of the way with the option of taking a short detour to visit the impressive cathedral. There's lots to see along the river with a series of bridges and historical buildings such as the New Mills Pumping House and the medieval watergate of Pulls Ferry. You'll also pass Cow Tower, a 14th century artillery tower with a fascinating history. If you'd like to extend your walk you could continue along the river and visit the delightful Whitlingham Country Park where you will find the Whitlingham Broads. There's also Mousehold Heath just to the north east of the city centre. The heath has a series of nice trails taking you to heathland, woodland and ponds.",
