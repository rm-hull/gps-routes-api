  "description": "This circular walk around the city centre of Norwich follows the lovely riverside path along the River Wensum. The walk starts near the forum in the centre of Norwich where parking is available. You could also start at the train station as the river is just a short distance away. There is a path on both sides of the river for most of the way with the option of taking a short detour to visit the impressive cathedral. There's lots to see along the river with a series of bridges and historical buildings such as the New Mills Pumping House and the medieval watergate of Pulls Ferry. You'll also pass Cow Tower, a 14th century artillery tower with a fascinating history. If you'd like to extend your walk you could continue along the river and visit the delightful Whitlingham Country Park where you will find the Whitlingham Broads. There's also Mousehold Heath just to the north east of the city centre. The heath has a series of nice trails taking you to heathland, woodland and ponds.",

      "content": "You can continue your riverside walking from the city on the Wherryman's Way. This will take you through the lovely Yare Valley to Great Yarmouth through the Norfolk Broads. You could follow the river east for a few miles to visit the delightful village of Surlingham and explore the RSPB Church Marsh Nature Reserve. Just to the south of the city you'll find one of the area's significant historical sites at Caistor St Edmund. There are two waymarked walking trails to follow around this old Roman town which includes earthworks, ruined walls and ditches. The town is notable as the capital of the Iceni tribe, who inhabited the flatlands and marshes of Norfolk and who revolted against Roman rule under their queen Boudicca (or Boadicea) in the winter of 61 CE. At the site you can also pick up the Boudicca Way long distance path and follow it south towards Shotesham with its pretty mill and ford. On the south western edge of the city at Cringleford you can pick up Ketts Country Walk and the Tas Valley Way where you can enjoy more riverside paths along the River Tas. The interesting village of Hethersett is also located near here. The Walsingham Way starts/finishes in the city. This long distance trail runs from the city centre to the mediaeval abbey at Great Walsingham, passing several fascinating historic sites on the way. Just to the east there's the village of Brundall, which is famous for its boat building industry. Near here you'll also find the RSPB's Strumpshaw Fen. There's some lovely trails here with River Yare views, marshland, lakes, orchid-rich meadows and lots of birdlife to see. A few miles to the north east of Brundall there's Burlingham where you can explore the peaceful trails around Burlingham Woods. It's a lovely place for a stroll with carpets of snowdrops in Ferbruary and lots of bluebells in the spring months. There's also the interesting ancient ruins of the 14th century St Peter church to see here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Walks page."
