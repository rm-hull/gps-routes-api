  "description": "This Hampshire based village is located just to the south east of Basingstoke . It's a pretty little place with a picturesque village pond and a fine old pub to rest in after your walk. This circular walk from Mapledurwell takes you through the countryside to visit the neighbouring village of Upton Grey. The walk starts in the village and heads south east along Downs Lane to Five Lanes End. You continue south following the course of the old Roman Road into Upton Grey. It's another very pretty settlement with a village pond and some fine looking timber framed cottages. The route then heads north passing Knights Wood and the old church before returning to the village.",
