  "description": "Enjoy a short walk around this country park and nature reserve in Walsall. In the park you will find tranquil pools, mature woodland, streams and over 300 species of plants. It's also a nature reserve so look out for a variety of birds including lapwings and yellowhammers. The park is located on the Beacon Way so there is the option of continuing your walk along the Rushall canal which runs past the park. Just to the south you will find the lovely Walsall Arboretum where there are nice surfaced paths to follow around the 80 acre park. You could also try the Walsall Canal Walk and the Wyrley and Essington Canal where there's a nice waterside cycling and walking trail leading to Rough Wood Country Park and Wolverhampton .",

The beacon is one of the highlights of the Black Country and a high point of the Birmingham city area. On the summit there is a distinctive domed war memorial and excellent views over the city and beyond. For more walking ideas in the area see the West Midlands Walks page."
