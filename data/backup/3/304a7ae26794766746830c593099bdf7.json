After playing a crucial part in the Civil war in the 17th c. it was partly demolished and the stones from the site were used to build Eaton Hall. The remains of the castle, shown above, are believed to be the inner courtyard. The building was also called Castle Lyons originally."

  "description": "This village in North East Wales is located in the Welsh Marches, close to the border with England. This circular walk visits the neighbouring villages of Farndon and Churton before a riverside stroll along the River Dee. The walk starts from the ruins of the 13th century Holt Castle which sit in a picturesque location next to the river. You then follow footpaths north crossing the river to visit Farndon in Cheshire, England. This pretty border village includes a 14th century church and a noteable medieval stone bridge. The route continues north along the long distance Marches Way to Churton. Here you turn west to follow a country lane to the River Dee. You can then pick up a riverside footpath heading south to return to the village.",
