The remains of the castle, shown above, are believed to be the inner courtyard. The building was also called Castle Lyons originally."

  "description": "This village in North East Wales is located in the Welsh Marches, close to the border with England. This circular walk visits the neighbouring villages of Farndon and Churton before a riverside stroll along the River Dee. The walk starts from the ruins of the 13th century Holt Castle which sit in a picturesque location next to the river. You then follow footpaths north crossing the river to visit Farndon in Cheshire, England. This pretty border village includes a 14th century church and a noteable medieval stone bridge. The route continues north along the long distance Marches Way to Churton. Here you turn west to follow a country lane to the River Dee. You can then pick up a riverside footpath heading south to return to the village.",
