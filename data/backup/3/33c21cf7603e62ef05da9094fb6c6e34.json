The canal was opened in 1794 between Basingstoke and the River Wey Navigation. It soon fell victim to competition from the London to Southampton Railway, and became derelict. It was purchased by Hampshire and Surrey County Councils in the mid-1970s and was restored by a volunteer workforce. It was reopened in 1991 and the Basingstoke Canal Authority formed to manage it."
