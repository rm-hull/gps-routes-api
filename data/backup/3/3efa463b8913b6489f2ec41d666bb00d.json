  "description": "Enjoy a short walk along Ellesmere Lake in this Shropshire based country park. The park boasts a lake, woodland walks and historic parkland on the edge of the medieval market town of Ellesmere. There is also an excellent Boathouse Visitor Centre and the lovely Victorian Cremorne Gardens on the shore of the Mere. These gardens additionally include the excellent Ellesmere Sculpture Trail. The stone and wood based pieces are created by international contemporary artists, commissioned by the Ellesmere Sculpture Initiative (ESi), and are made specifically in response to the location. The lake is a good place for birdwatching too with many wintering birds visiting the island in the centre. Keep your eyes peeled for the nesting herons as you may your way along the surfaced footpath. If you'd like to continue you walk you could follow the Llangollen Canal to the nearby Colemere Country Park. It's only about a mile south east of the lake and includes another circular waterside trail. Just pick up the canal towpath to the south of the car park.",
