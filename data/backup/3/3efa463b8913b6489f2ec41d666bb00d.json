  "description": "Enjoy a short walk along Ellesmere Lake in this Shropshire based country park. The park boasts a lake, woodland walks and historic parkland on the edge of the medieval market town of Ellesmere. There is also an excellent Boathouse Visitor Centre and the lovely Victorian Cremorne Gardens on the shore of the Mere. These gardens additionally include the excellent Ellesmere Sculpture Trail. The stone and wood based pieces are created by international contemporary artists, commissioned by the Ellesmere Sculpture Initiative (ESi), and are made specifically in response to the location. The lake is a good place for birdwatching too with many wintering birds visiting the island in the centre. Keep your eyes peeled for the nesting herons as you may your way along the surfaced footpath. If you'd like to continue you walk you could follow the Llangollen Canal to the nearby Colemere Country Park. It's only about a mile south east of the lake and includes another circular waterside trail. Just pick up the canal towpath to the south of the car park.",

      "content": "To continue your walking near Ellesmere you could head to the neighbouring settlements of Oswestry, Whitchurch, Wem and Whittington where there's a 13th century moated castle to see. A few miles to the north east there's another lakeside walk at the pretty Hanmer Mere in Wrexham. It's another of the local meres that's considered part of the Shropshire Lake District. Along the canal from Colemere there's also the Fenns, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve. The noteworthy reserve straddles the border between England and Wales. It is a significant site being one of the biggest and best raised bogs in Britain. The area is great for flora and fauna and also includes the old Ellesmere Canal. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Walks page."
