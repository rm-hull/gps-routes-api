These were the four children of an Irish king turned into swans by that perennial villain of mythology, their stepmother (in this case called Aoife). The children were condemned to swim for 300 years on the lough"

  "description": "This large lake is located in County Westmeath just north of Mullingar. It's a popular place for watersports and fishing with some nice walks to try too. Near the Lough Derravaragh Camp site at the north western end of the lake you will find the Donore Woodland Walk. The lakeside woodland is a pleasant place for an easy walk with peaceful woodland trails, little bridges, a fairy garden and lots of wildlife to see. At the south eastern end of the lake there is another car park by the lake where you can go for a stroll along the shoreline. The lough sits on the River Inny which flows from Lough Sheelin on its way to the River Shannon. To continue your walking in the area head a few miles east to visit Fore Abbey. The ancient abbey dates back to the 13th century and includes a circular walk taking you around the historic buildings and the village of Fore.",
