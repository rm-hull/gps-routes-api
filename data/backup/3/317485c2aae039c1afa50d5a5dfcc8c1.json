The trail is now in the ownership of Congleton Borough Council."

  "description": "This Cheshire based town is in a good spot for walking with canal paths, two local rail trails and some decent waymarked countryside trails running through the surrounding area. This route uses the Salt Line and the Trent and Mersey Canal to create a circular walk around Alsager. On the way you'll enjoy easy surfaced trails, canalside footpaths and pay a visit to the historic Rode Hall. The walk starts just north of the town centre at Bridge Farm where you can pick up the Salt Line around Lawton Heath End. Follow the shared walking and cycling path north west and it will take you up to the canal around Hassall Green. You can then follow the towpath east past Roughwood Farm to Thurlwood and Rode Hall. This fine Georgian country house is a lovely place for a stroll. It's well known for its winter snowdrop walks and includes parkland, woodland, gardens and a large lake. After exploring the park you can then cross the canal and pick up other footpaths and country lanes to take you back to the start point. You can extend this walk by continuing south east along the canal for about a mile to visit Lawton Hall where there is a public footpath running past the estate's lake.",
