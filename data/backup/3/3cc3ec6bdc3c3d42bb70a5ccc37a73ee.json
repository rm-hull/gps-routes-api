  "description": "This pretty village is located in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire near to the town of Market Rasen. This circular walk from the village explores the surrounding countryside on a series of bridle paths and footpaths. There's some lovely Lincolnshire Wolds views and woodland areas where you can see snowdrops in late winter. Starting in the village head east to pick up a bridleway heading south towards Great Tows. You then head west towards Thorpe-le-Vale before turning north and then west to Kirmond Le Mire. After exploring Kirmond Le Mire you follow footpaths east past Binbrook Top to return to the village. The Viking Way long distance trail passes through the area. You could pick this up near Ludford at the southern end of the route and then follow the trail north west to visit neighbouring Tealby .",
