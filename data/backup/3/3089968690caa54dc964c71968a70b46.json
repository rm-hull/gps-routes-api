  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of The South Downs Way from the coast at Eastbourne to the village of Alfriston in the lovely valley of the River Cuckmere. The route runs for about 9 miles with views of the Weald countryside to enjoy on the way. From the high points there are also splendid views back to the coast. The route starts on the front in Eastbourne before picking up the waymarked trail and following it north to Jevington. The path then passes the noteworthy Long Man of Wilmington, an iconic hill figure on Windover Hill. The final section then descends to the village, crossing the River Cuckmere before finishing in Alfriston. To extend your exercise try our Cuckmere River and Cuckmere Haven Walk which takes you from the village to the beautiful Cuckmere Haven on the south coast.",
