  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Hodsock Priory in the Nottinghamshire village of Hodsock. The priory is open to the public during Feburary when you can enjoy a walk around the gardens and woods. At this time of year there are carpets of lovely snowdrops to see. All year round you can follow the public footpaths that surround the estate. From the trails there are fine views over the 800-acre (3.2 km2) Hodsock Estate and the surrounding Nottinghamshire countryside. This circular walk begins from the village of Carlton in Lindrick which lies just to the west of the estate. From here you can pick up a mixture of bridleways and footpaths heading around the estate for a distance of just over 3 miles. On the way you will also pass North Carlton where there is a pretty pond. The area is great for wildlife with various waterfowl attracted to Hodsock's lake. Look out for oystercatchers, great crested grebes and common shelducks in this area. Other birds you may see include little owls, common kingfishers, common kestrels, green woodpeckers, hobbies, robins, Eurasian wrens and long-tailed tits. To extend the walk head a couple of miles north west to visit Langold Lake Country Park. There's lovely waterside paths around the park's two lakes and a nature reserve with lots of wildlife to see.",
