The Saddle Knob is the grassy slope, with an old quarry at its foot. In the background is the much bigger Betchworth Quarry - until a few years ago its white cliff was a landmark for miles around. Now only the top shows, the rest having been used as a large landfill, now landscaped and being managed to make new downland. In the very far distance is White Downs. Box Hill, perhaps the most famous part of this stretch of the North Downs, is not visible, lying around the corner beyond Betchworth Quarry."

  "description": "Climb to the 722 ft (220 m) summit of Colley Hill on this walk in the North Downs. Colley Hill is located just to the west of Reigate Hill . It's a satisfying climb with great views  over Surrey to the South Downs. You start off at the Wray Lane car park near Gatton Park and follow the North Downs Way west to the hill summit. You'll pass Reigate Fort, woodlands and grassland with pretty wildflowers in the summer. As you climb you can enjoy great views of Box Hill and Leith Hill. You'll also pass the interesting Inglis Memorial. If you'd like to extend your walk then the Reigate Hill and Gatton Park Walk also starts from the Wray Lane car park.",
