  "description": "Visit this delightful area of woodland near Sandown and look out for red squirrels on this short walk on the Isle of Wight. The shady woodland is owned by the National Trust so there are nice footpaths to follow and an on site car park. The woodland consists of\u00a0hazel and sweet chestnut\u00a0with carpets of bluebells in the spring. You can also climb to a viewpoint where you can enjoy views towards the coast and Culver Down . The woods are close to the villages of Queen's Bower and Alverston where you can buy refreshments. If you'd like to walk to the woods then you could follow the Yar River Trail from Sandown to Alverston and then head south. If you are coming by bike then you could follow National Cycle Route 67 from Sandown.",
