  "description": "This lovely park in south east London has good footpaths through bluebell woodland, a terraced garden, a rose garden and parkland. The area is in an elevated position on Shooter's Hill so there are great views of the city of London and the surrounding countryside to enjoy. In the park you will find ancient woodland including oak, silver birch, hornbeam and coppice hazel. There's nice wide lawns where you can enjoy a picnic and the far ranging views. In Castle Wood you will find the 18th century Severndroog Castle. The impressive Gothic-style castle  has a viewing platform from which you can see several of the surrounding counties on a clear day. The park also has good facilities with a car park and a nice cafe. The Green Chain Walk passes right through the park so you can pick this up to extend your walking in the area. Heading north will take you through Eltham Common and Woolwich Common before coming to the River Thames in Greenwich. Head east and you will soon come to Bostall Woods where there are more nice walking trails to try. Adjacent to Bostall Woods is the fine Lesnes Abbey Woods where you can explore the ruins of the 12th century abbey and visit the lovely ornamental garden and arboretum.",
