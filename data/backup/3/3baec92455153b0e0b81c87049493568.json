  "description": "Enjoy a climb to the highest point in the county of Buckinghamshire on this circular walk in Wendover Woods. There's a car park located very close to the hill summit from which you can start the walk. Follow the path east and you will soon reach the 267 m (876 ft) summit where you will find a rock marking the high point of the Chilterns. The rest of the route explores some of the footpaths to the south of the hill before returning to the car park. The Icknield Way Path and The Ridgeway long distance trails both pass the hill. To continue your hill climbing in the Chilterns, follow the trails west to Coombe Hill. Here you can enjoy fabulous views over the Aylesbury Vale and the Cotswolds.",
