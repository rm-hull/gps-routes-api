  "description": "This ancient market town sits on the edge of the Black Mountains in the Brecon Beacons National Park. There's some great local history with local highights including the 12th century Bronllys Castle, a 14th century church and Talgarth Mill, an 18th-century water mill in the centre of the town. Bronllys Castle is well worth a visit as you can climb to the top of the tower and enjoy some excellent views over the surrounding hills and mountains. This walk from the town takes you south to visit the Pwll-y-Wrach Nature Reserve. It's a lovely place for a walk with ancient woodland, riverside trails along the River Ennig and pretty waterfalls. The reserve has some interesting flora and fauna including the lesser butterfly-orchid and the lesser horseshoe bat. In the spring you can see lots of bluebells while wildflowers appear in the summer months. To continue your walking in the area head south where you can try the more challenging climbs to Waun Fach and Mynydd Troed. The waterside paths around Llangorse Lake are also located near here. To the north you can pick up the Wye Valley Walk and enjoy more riverside trails along the River Wye around Glasbury .",
