  "description": "This park is run by the National Trust and contains the lovely Frensham Ponds which attract a variety of rare birds such as the reed bunting, sedge warbler, great crested grebe, nightjars and woodlarks. There are a number of peaceful footpaths taking you around the ponds and through the heathland which includes a mixture of purple heathers, bright yellow gorse and rich green bracken. The park also contains bridleways which can be used by cyclists. If you'd like to continue your outing you could head to the nearby Devil's Punch Bowl and Gibbet Hill. Here you'll find miles of cycling and walking trails through a natural nature reserve, filled with heathland, streams and woodland. Thursley National Nature Reserve is located a few miles to the east in Elstead. The wildlife rich reserve has miles of footpaths through heathland and woodland with a huge variety of wildlife. Just to the south you will find the splendid Sculpture Park in Churt. Just to the north there are more nice woodland trails in Bourne Woods, site of Ridley Scott's Robin Hood Film set from his 2010 film starring Russell Crowe. The park is located close to the popular town of Farnham, where the epic North Downs Way begins. Please Note: Fires and BBQs are not allowed at the site and people could be charged if they have them due to the risk to life and property.",

      "content": "Head a few miles south of the park and you can visit some more lovely ponds at Waggoners Wells. Though not as famous as Frensham it's a place worthy of some investigation. The National Trust site includes three ponds surrounded by peaceful woodland. It's a nice easy place to extend your outing if you have time.  Pictured above are Waggoners Wells. This tranquil beauty spot near Frensham makes a nice addition to your outing. The circular Tilford Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the pond. The attractive settlement is well worth a visit with a pretty village green, cricket pitch and two medieaval stone bridges over the River Wey which runs through the settlement. There's also a fine local pub dating to 1705 with interesting historical photos and memorabilia to see inside."
