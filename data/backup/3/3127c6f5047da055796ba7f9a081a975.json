  "description": "This circular walk starts from the Box Hill and Westhumble train station in the Surrey Hills. The station is located just to the east of the small village of Westhumble. It is reachable from\u00a0London Victoria\u00a0via\u00a0Sutton, London Waterloo\u00a0via\u00a0Wimbledon and Dorking. The area is great for walkers with several waymarked trails, woodland, common land and hill climbs with wonderful views over the Surrey Hills. The route starts by heading west to take you through the village of Westhumble to visit the interesting ruins of the ancient chapel which dates from the 12th century. The trail then takes you into the expansive Ranmore Common where there are miles of woodland trails and a fine viewpoint at the southern edge. You'll also pass Denbies Hillside , part of the Denbies wine estate which contains the largest vineyard in England. You can then pick up a section of the North Downs Way and follow it east to explore Box Hill Country Park . The park has more fine woodland and parkland trails with viewpoints and cycle tracks as well. On the western side of the park there's the famous stepping stones walk, a well known local beauty spot on the River Mole. After exploring the park the route heads west to return you to the train station. To continue your walking you can pick up the Mole Gap Trail in Westhumble and enjoy a pleasant waterside walk along the River Mole. The station is also the endpoint for the Thames Down Link which runs to Kingston upon Thames.",
