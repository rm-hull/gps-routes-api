  "description": "This Wiltshire based village is located close to Corsham and Bath in a nice rural part of the county. There's some nice waterside walking along the By Brook and a significant waymarked trail running through the area. It's also quite close to the Cotswolds , one of the premier walking areas of the country. The village is probably most well known for the Box railway tunnel created by Isambard Kingdom Brunel between December 1838 and June 1841. This circular walk takes you north along the Macmillan Way and the pretty By Brook to Drewitt's Mill. You can easily extend the walk by continuing north along the waymarked trail and the river towards Slaughterford, Biddestone and Castle Combe . You could extend the walk by continuing north to visit neighbouring Colerne . Here you will find nearly 90 historic listed buildings including a 13th century church and a noteworthy 17th century stone pub.",
