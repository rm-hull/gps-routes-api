  "description": "These woods near Lapford are a popular place for dog walkers. The walk starts off at the car park, just off the A377. You could also start from nearby Eggesford train station on the Exeter to Barnstaple railway line. In the woods you'll find miles of nice trails, some fine Douglas Fir trees, pretty streams and lots of interesting flora and fauna. There's also a motte and bailey castle, which is the remains of a once-imposing Norman fort. The Ridge and Valley Walk passes through the forest so you can follow this waymarked trail for part of the route. You could extend the walk by following the trail north east to the village of Chawleigh or north toward Chumleigh. The popular Tarka Trail passes to the west of the forest and is another good option for exploring the area surrounding the woods.",
