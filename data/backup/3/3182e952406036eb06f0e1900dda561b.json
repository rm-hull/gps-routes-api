The road to Hinton now goes off left whilst the mainroad rounds the bend to Abson and Wick. The reason is the large number of houses built to the south of the village in the 1960s and 1970s."

  "description": "This large village in South Gloucestershire is located close to Bristol and Bath on the edge of the Cotswolds. This circular walk from the village visits two of the highlights of the area, heading to the splendid Dyrham Park before following a section of the Monarch's Way to the photogenic Wick Quarry. The walk starts south of the village where you can pick up the Redford Lane and follow it east to Dyrham Park. Here you'll find a 270 acre deer park surrounding a 17th-century mansion. You then follow a country lane south west to visit Doynton where there are views of the River Boyd and the 17th century Doynton House. At Doynton you pick up the Monarch's Way and follow the waymarked footpath south west to visit Wick. There's some nice trails here around the Golden Valley Nature Reserve and the atmospheric quarry. From Wick you head north to Nashcombe Hill and Clovermead Farm before returning to the outskirts of the village.",
