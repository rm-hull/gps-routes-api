  "description": "This riverside village near Maidenhead has some nice local trails and a noteworthy ancient pub. This circular walk from the village takes you to the Ashley Hill Forest and the Hurley Chalk Pit Nature Reserve before a riverside walk along the Thames. The walk starts in the village and follows country lanes and footpaths south to High Wood and Ashley Hill Woods. There's some nice woodland trails here and climb to Ashley Hill. The route then follows trails north west to Hurley Chalk Pit Nature Reserve. The small reserve includes woodland, scrub, grassland and hedges. There's also 15 species of butterfly, including common blues and gatekeepers to be found here. From here you follow paths north to the river where you can pick up the Thames Path National Trail. The riverside path will take you east back to the village.",

It's well worth a visit with a historic high street with many old listed buildings, a picturesque marina, a 12th century church and a very fine riverside pub where you can relax with a view of the river. You can also pick up the Knowl Hill Bridleway near here. The circular cycling and walking route explores the area around Knowl Hill, with some fine views from the high points. Just to the east of nearby Marlow is the neighbouring village of Little Marlow. Here you can explore the wildlife rich Spade Oak Nature Reserve and visit the historic 14th century church and 16th century pub.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Berkshire Walks page."
