  "description": "This riverside village near Maidenhead has some nice local trails and a noteworthy ancient pub. This circular walk from the village takes you to the Ashley Hill Forest and the Hurley Chalk Pit Nature Reserve before a riverside walk along the Thames. The walk starts in the village and follows country lanes and footpaths south to High Wood and Ashley Hill Woods. There's some nice woodland trails here and climb to Ashley Hill. The route then follows trails north west to Hurley Chalk Pit Nature Reserve. The small reserve includes woodland, scrub, grassland and hedges. There's also 15 species of butterfly, including\u00a0common blues\u00a0and\u00a0gatekeepers to be found here. From here you follow paths north to the river where you can pick up the Thames Path National Trail. The riverside path will take you east back to the village.",
