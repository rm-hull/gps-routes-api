On the way you can look out for a variety of wildlife including mistle thrush, great and blue tits, great spotted woodpecker, crossbill, siskin, lesser redpoll. In the heathland areas there's also common lizards and nightjar to see. If you're lucky you might even spot a deer in the woodland area. There's also some interesting flora with lots of pretty bluebells in the spring months. The park is adjacent to Horsford Woods . Just head east from the car park and you can explore these expansive woods. To continue your walking in the area head north to visit Marsham Heath near Aylsham . There's more good footpaths here with miles of heathland and woodland to explore.",
