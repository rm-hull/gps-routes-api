  "description": "This circular walk from the West Yorkshire town of Keighley makes use of the waymarked Worth Way to visit nearby Haworth and Penistone Hill Country Park. The route runs for just over 11 miles, with some moderate hill climbs along the way. Highlights on the route include riverside sections along the River Worth, views of the Keighley & Worth Valley Heritage Railway and some beautiful West Yorkshire countryside views from the high points. You can start the walk from Keighley train station which is located right next to the river and the start of the Worth Way. Follow the waymarked footpath south west along the river towards Ingrow. You continue through the town, past Damens, Harewood Hill, Cackleshaw, Oakworth and Mytholmes before coming into Haworth. After exploring the town you continue south west and soon come to Penistone Hill Country Park. It's a popular place for walkers with a fairly large hill to climb and fine views over the surrounding hills and reservoirs. After exploring the park, head back into Haworth before turning south along the Bridgehouse Beck towards Oxenhope. You then turn north east along Brow Moor, passing Cliffe Hill and Cullingworth Moor on the way. The route continues north through the countryside, before passing Woodhouse and returning to the train station.",
