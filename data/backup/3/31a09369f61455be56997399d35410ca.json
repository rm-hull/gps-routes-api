  "description": "This pretty village is located in the Churnet Valley area of the Staffordshire Moorlands . The area includes a wonderful old mill museum, canalside trails, a fine local country park and the splendid Churnet Valley Heritage Railway . This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the area including Cheddleton Flint Mill, the River Churnet, the Caldon Canal and Deep Hayes Country Park . The walk starts from the Flint Mill in the village centre. The old mill dates from the period of the Industrial Revolution and is Grade II listed. The interesting site features two water mills, a small museum, a period cottage, the canal and many other exhibits. From here you can pick up a path along the Caldon Canal and follow it north past the weir towards Horse Bridge. You can then pick up footpaths heading through Deep Hayes with its woodland and series of pretty lakes. The route then passes Crowpoint Wood before turning east to Shaffalong and back into Cheddleton.",
