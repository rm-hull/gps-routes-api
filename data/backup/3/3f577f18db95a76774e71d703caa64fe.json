    "description": "Enjoy wonderful views over the Dorset countryside from this historical viewpoint near Portesham and Abbotsbury . The monument was built in 1844 in memory of Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy, Flag Captain of HMS Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar. This circular walk starts at the National Trust car park next to the monument and takes you over Black Down and through Benecke Wood. The walk can be extended to visit Portesham Hill and the nearby village of Portesham. If you're coming by bike then you could catch a train to Dorchester and follow National Cycle Network Route 2 to the monument. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could visit the lovely Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens which are only a few miles from the monument. Also nearby is the fascinating Iron Age Hillfort of Maiden Castle . The South Dorset Ridgeway passes the monument and is a great way to explore this section of the Jurassic Coast .",
