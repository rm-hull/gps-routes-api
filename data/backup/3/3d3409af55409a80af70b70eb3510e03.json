Elsewhere, especially towards the eastern end of the Trail, where the Trail runs in a narrow strip fenced off from the adjacent fields, PVC \"honeycombs\" have been laid down. In this image, honeycombs have been stored by the side of the Trail preparatory to laying them on the path. This view is looking eastwards towards Harlow Hill; to the right of the hedge is the post-Roman Military Road B6318."

  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this scenic group of reservoirs next to Hadrian's Wall. The area is also a nature reserve with good wildlife spotting opportunites. The walk starts from the roadside parking area in between the reservoirs. You can then follow country lanes, bridleways and a section of the Hadrian's Wall Path around the water. The route runs for just under 4 miles with nice views across the water to the surrounding hills and countryside. The lakes are a popular spot for fishing and also attract various water loving birds. Look out for Great crested grebe, wigeon, lapwing and tufted duck as you make your way around the site.",

There's a fascinating Roman camp and nice trails along the River Tyne to Riding Mill here. If you head east you can visit the Tyne Riverside Country Park in Ovingham near Newcastle. To the north west there's a few more reservoirs to explore including Hallington Reservoir and Colt Crag Reservoir. The latter has some nice waterside nature trails with notable wildlife including red squirrels, roe deer, otters and great crested grebes. Just to the north of Colt Crag there's also Sweethope Loughs where you'll find two nice fishing lakes with woodland and waterside paths. For more walking ideas in the area see the Tyne and Wear Walks page."
