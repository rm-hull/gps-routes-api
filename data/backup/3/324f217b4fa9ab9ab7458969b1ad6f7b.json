  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Newquay to Crantock via Towan Head and Pentire Point. The walk starts from the town centre next to the train station and bus station. From here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow the waymarked trail up to Towan Head. You then head south along the popular surfing area at Fistral Beach before coming to Pentire. Follow the footpath around the headland at Pentire Point where there are nice views down to the lovely Crantock Beach. After passing around Pentire Point you can catch the Fernpit Ferry over the River Gannel to the Crantock side. During high tide in the summer season, the Boathouse provides access between Crantock Beach and East Pentire headland, Newquay. At low tide a foot bridge will allow you to walk across the river free of charge. On the other side follow the path along the Rushy Green before heading south east into Crantock village. The coast path then runs south east to Trevemper before crossing the Gannel and returning to Newquay.",

From the cafe there are great views over Crantock beach and the River Gannel. It was built in the late 19th Century and has served as a tea garden for over 90 years. The cafe serves fresh crab sandwiches using crab caught and landed by our very own fishing boat Excelsior."
