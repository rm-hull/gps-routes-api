  "description": "The town of Crowborough is nicely positioned for exploring the expansive Ashdown Forest and the High Weald AONB. There's also some fine waymarked trails running through the area including the Vanguard Way and the Wealdway. This circular walk takes you around Crowborough Common. The common is located just to the south west of the town centre and includes 220 acres of heathland and woodland. It's a nice place for a stroll with a number of trails to follow around the site. There's also picturesque streams and in the autumn months there is lots of pretty heather to see. You can pick up the footpaths just west of Whitehill and follow them south past the golf club to Sweethaws Wood and Piping Wood. Other bridleways will then take you past Redbridge Farm on the eastern side of the common. To continue your walking around the town head to Crowborough Country Park. Here you'll find more nice footpaths taking you to wet and dry woodland, grass and heath glades, marshes, streams and ponds. It's located just to the east of Jarvis Brook and the train station. Just to the west of the common you can pick up the Vanguard Way and use the waymarked trail to explore Ashdown Forest. Here you can explore 500 Acre Wood on the Pooh Walk and pay a visit to Pooh Sticks Bridge. The ancient Chelwood Vachery can also be visited near here.",
