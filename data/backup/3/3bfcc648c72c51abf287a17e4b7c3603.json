Moseley Bog lies approximately 3 miles south of Birmingham City Centre. This is a woodland explored by Tolkien during the few years he lived in the area as a young child. It is made up of both wet and dry woodland together with patches of fen vegetation which has developed on the site of an old millpond. There is also an area of secondary woodland, which has developed on the old gardens along the eastern boundary."

  "description": "This local nature reserve in the Moseley area of Birmingham is a nice place for an easy stroll in the city. There's ancient woodland, ponds and lots of wildlife to look out for at the site. The area is also notable as being Tolkien's inspiration for the ancient forests in the famous The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit books. Just to the east you can visit Sarehole Mill. There's some fine trails along the River Cole around the 16th century mill which is notable as Birmingham's last surviving water mill. You can also pick up the River Cole Valley Walk and visit Kingfisher Country Park at the mill. To the south is Swanshurst Park where there's a short circular footpath around a pretty lake.",
