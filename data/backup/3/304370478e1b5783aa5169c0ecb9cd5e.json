  "description": "Bushy Park is a beautiful deer park in Hampton Wick, London. This walk takes you on a tour of the park, starting and finishing very close to Hampton Wick train station. You will pass a series of tranquil ponds before strolling along Cheshunt Avenue to the Diana Fountain. You head through the park towards the Teddington end before returning to the start point along Cobbler's walk. There are plenty of excellent photo opportunities with the many resident deer as they will often let you come quite close. The walk is also very close to the river Thames and adjacent to the fabulous Hampton Court Park and Gardens if you would like to continue your walk around this lovely area. The Richmond to Kingston River Walk is a also a great option as it starts/finishes on the opposite side of Kingston Bridge. You can visit the pretty Teddington Lock and Canbury Gardens on this route.",
