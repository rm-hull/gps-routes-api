  "description": "This walk explores the lovely Cockerham Sands on the Lancashire coast. It's a fine place for a bracing walk with excellent views across the Lune Estuary to Sunderland Point. There's also a visit to a historic Scheduled Ancient Monument to enjoy on the way. You can start the walk from the car park at Glasson Dock, just to the north of the sands. From here you can pick up the Lancashire Coastal Way and follow the waymarked footpath south along Marsh Lane to the coast at Crook Farm. Continue south and the path will take you Plover Hill and the remains of Cockersand Abbey. The abbey was founded in the 12th century but the only significant remains are the vaulted chapter house which was built in 1230. It is notable as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The route then continues east past the caravan site to Cockerham village where you can enjoy refreshments at the local inn before returning on the same paths.",
