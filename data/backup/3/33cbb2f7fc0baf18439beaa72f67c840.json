  "description": "This walk explores the unique landscape of the Barnack Hills and Holes National Nature Reserve in the Cambridgeshire village of Barnack. The 50 acre site includes some pleasant footpaths taking you around the grassy slopes of the ancient medieval quarry. It's a significant site for flora and fauna with wildflowers, orchids, limestone grassland and a wide variety of insects. You'll find the site on the western side of Barnack village. There is a public car park where you can pick up the trails. If you felt like extending the walk then you could pick up the Torpel Way on the eastern side of the village. The long distance trail could be followed through the countryside to nearby Stamford . On the western side there's the Hereward Way which could be followed to Burghley House with its lovely parkland and large lake.",
