  "description": "This walk visits Caragh Lake in the Reeks District in County Kerry. You can park at the car park on the eastern side of the lake to start your walk. From here you can follow a footpath up to Caragh View where there are some great views over the lough, Inch beach, the Dingle peninsula and MacGillycuddy's Reeks mountains. You can also see the lake's pretty islands - Robert\u2019s Island and Illaunbuddoga. The area includes some pleasant woodland trails where you can look out for wildlife such as Sika deer, foxes and rabbits. You can continue your walking by heading west and picking up the Glenbeigh and Rossbeigh Hill Loop which visits the beautiful beach at Rossbeigh Strand and a fine viewpoint overlooking the village. The climb to Seefin Mountain is also not far from the western side of the lake.",
