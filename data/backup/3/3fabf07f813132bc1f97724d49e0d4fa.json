Lord Thanet had control of Bodiam Castle by the time the English Civil War broke out in 1641. He backed the Royalist cause and sold the castle to help pay the fines Parliament levied against him. After that, the castle was destroyed, and it remained an attractive ruin until John Fuller bought it in 1829."

There is also a noteworthy 12th-century church, which contains a brass of a knight with the arms of the de Bodeham family, one of the first lords of the manor."

  "description": "This 14th century moated castle in Sussex is one of the National Trust's most visited properties. There's spiral staircases, battlements and the castle's original wooden portcullis, an extremely rare example of its kind. You can also listen to an interesting talk about medieval life from one of the authentically dressed medieval characters in the castle. The grounds are particularly lovely with wide lawns, views of the moat and the River Rother. Also look out for bats roosting in the castle structure. The Sussex Border Path long distance walking trail runs past the castle so you could pick this up and walk east to Northiam if you wanted to continue your walk. There is also a pleasant public footpath heading west along the River Rother.",

South west of the castle there's the pretty Darwell Reservoir. Here you can enjoy footpaths through Darwell Wood with views across the water. Nearer the castle there's a public footpath heading west along the River Rother. This will take you into Robertsbridge, passing the remains of Robertsbridge Abbey on the way. Just to the east is the beautiful Great Dixter House & Gardens in Northiam. There's a 15th-century manor house and the late Christopher Lloyd's exemplary gardens to explore here. Postcode is TN31 6PH."
