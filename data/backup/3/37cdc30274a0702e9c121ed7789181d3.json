  "description": "This walk explores Castlemorton Common near the village of Castlemorton in Worcestershire. The common is a popular place for a walk with miles of trails and fine views towards the Malvern Hills which lie just to the west of the site. There's also grazing cattle, lots of wildflowers in the summer, ponds, woodland and wildlife to enjoy. This circular walk starts from the Swinyard Hill public car park on the south western side of the common. From here you can pick up the trails heading north and then east across the expansive common. The Worcestershire Way Link runs through the common. You could pick up the trail and follow it west to climb to Herefordshire Beacon and British Camp. Here you will find an Iron Age Hillfort and some glorious views over the common and the surrounding countryside.",
