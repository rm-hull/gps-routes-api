The old stone roof has been patched with corrugated metal sheeting. The name, Dol-y-gaer, means meadow (at) the camp, referring to the fortified hill above."

It was used as a hill fort during the Iron Age - it must have been the obvious choice for that purpose at the time due to its large level surface surrounded by crags on almost all sides! Crickhowell, the town below, was named after the fort. The area surrounding Table Mountain to W, S and E is enclosed farmland."

  "description": "Enjoy wonderful views over the Brecon Beacons on this moderate climb to the 451m peak of Table Mountain (Crug Hywel). The walk starts from the pretty town of Crickhowell with its ruined Norman castle and 18th century 13-arched bridge across the river Usk. You then follow the Table Mountain footpath which starts at the northern end of the town. It passes through fields and woodland to the unusual flat top of the mountain. At the top you will find an Iron Age Hill Fort and wonderful views in all directions. If you would like to extend the walk then you could continue north along the Cambrian Way to the summit of Pen Cerrig Calch, a subsidiary summit of Waun Fach, standing at a height of 701 metres. You could also pick up the Usk Valley Walk which runs past Crickhowell. The long distance Brecon Beacons Way also passes Table Mountain so you can easily pick this up too.",
