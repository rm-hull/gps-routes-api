  "description": "This short circular walk takes you around Abbeystead Reservoir in the Forest of Bowland. The reservoir has an impressive curved weir and is surrounded by some beautiful countryside. This walk starts in Abbeystead and follows the Wyre Way footpath along the southern shore of the reservoir. You'll pass near to the waters edge with a woodland section through Hinberry Wood. You then pass the weir and Bank Wood before returning to Abbeystead. It's a fairly easy, 1.6 mile walk with lovely views of the River Wyre and the Forest of Bowland countryside and hills.",
