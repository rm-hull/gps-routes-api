  "description": "A fine circular walk visiting the canal, river and parks of the city of Exeter. The route makes use of waymarked trails to take you to the Riverside Valley Park with waterside sections along the Exeter Canal and the River Exe to enjoy. Starting from the Exeter Docks the walk heads through the Riverside Valley Park which runs between the canal and the river. There's nice cycling and walking trails running through the park with lots of wildlife to look out for too. Follow the footpaths to the Countess Wear Brdige where you cross the river and start the return leg. Follow the paths along the eastern side of the river past Northbrook Park to Belle Isle Park. This pretty riverside park has nice views of the river and the Trews Weir Allotments. Look out for Herons, cormorants, woodpeckers, and swallows as you make your way through the park. The final section takes you past the pedestrian Butts Ferry at Exeter Quay before returning to the start point. To extend your walking in the Exeter area you can continue along the long distance trails which run through the town. You could follow the Exe Valley Way towards Topsham. Here you can explore the beautiful Exe Estuary and visit the animals at Darts Farm on the popular Topsham Goat Walk .",

      "content": "Follow the Exe Valley way north from the city and you can visit the pretty village of Brampford Speke and the picturesque Bickleigh Mill. It's a fine place for a stroll with a historic mill and shopping area right next to the river. There's also an excellent riverside pub here too. A few miles to the north east there's the town of Cullompton on the River Culm. The historic settlement includes a 15th century church, interesting old mills, a Grade I listed 17th century house, several Grade II listed buildings and a nice easy mill leat walking trail.  Just a few miles north east of the city there's the wonderful Killerton Park Estate to explore. The National Trust owned park covers thousands of acres with miles of great cycling and walking trails surrounding the 18th century mansion. The historic village of Broadclyst and the peaceful woodland trails around Ashclyst Forest can also be found in this area. For an alternative circular walk around the city see the Exeter Green Circle. This 12 mile trail visits the Alphin Brook Valley, the village of Alphington, the Hoopern Valley, Mincinglake Valley Park and The Ludwell Valley. For more walking ideas in the county see the Devon Walks page."
