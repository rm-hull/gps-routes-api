    "description": "A fine circular walk visiting the canal, river and parks of the city of Exeter. The route makes use of waymarked trails to take you to the Riverside Valley Park with waterside sections along the Exeter Canal and the River Exe to enjoy. Starting from the Exeter Docks the walk heads through the Riverside Valley Park which runs between the canal and the river. There's nice cycling and walking trails running through the park with lots of wildlife to look out for too. Follow the footpaths to the Countess Wear Brdige where you cross the river and start the return leg. Follow the paths along the eastern side of the river past Northbrook Park to Belle Isle Park. This pretty riverside park has nice views of the river and the Trews Weir Allotments. Look out for Herons, cormorants, woodpeckers, and swallows as you make your way through the park. The final section takes you past the pedestrian Butts Ferry at Exeter Quay before returning to the start point. To extend your walking in the Exeter area you can continue along the long distance trails which run through the town. You could follow the Exe Valley Way towards Topsham. Here you can explore the beautiful Exe Estuary and visit the animals at Darts Farm on the popular Topsham Goat Walk .",
