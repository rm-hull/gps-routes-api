There's also the exhilarating Elie and Earlsferry Chain Walk to try. This challenging scramble takes you along rocky path with fascinating geology and fine coastal views. Heading west from Elie will take you to Lower Largo and Shell Bay. The delightful bay and the ancient fishing village are well worth exploring. Alexander Selkirk the prototype for Defoe's fictional Robinson Crusoe was born in Lower Largo in 1676. There is a statue dedicated to him in the village. In nearby St Andrews there's the popular Craigtoun Country Park. Here you can visit the nature trail, Italian garden, greenhouses, formal gardens, miniature railway and the large pond. The waterside trails at Cameron Reservoir are also not too far away."
