  "description": "This walk explores the Lough Boora Discovery Park in County Offaly. There are a number of trails to follow around the site with a series of fine sculptures, waterside trails and some fine views to enjoy. Other features include boardwalks, wetland and a cycle track. On the way you can look out for a variety of wildlife including Whooper Swans, Meadow Pipit and Skylark. To continue your lakeside walking in the area head north to try the Lough Ree Park Walking Trail, a popular place for easy strolls and lakeside picnics. The lough is located near the town of Athlone where you can enjoy a nice walk along the River Shannon, Ireland's longest River.",
