  "description": "This is a popular riverside walk from Cambridge to the nearby village of Grantchester. It takes you along the River Cam with lovely views of Grantchester Meadows and the surrounding countryside. It's now a tradition for university students to punt to Grantchester for breakfast during the May Balls so you should see lots of little boats along the way. The walk starts in the centre of Cambridge near the tourist information centre. You then follow paths to the famous Cambridge Backs where you can enjoy nice views of some of the University colleges. The walk continues south through Sheep's Green and Coe Fen Nature Reserve. Considering it closeness to the city it's a delightfully pastoral scene with cows and sheep grazing next to the meandering river. You continue south through the pretty Paradise Nature Reserve where there are some peaceful woodland trails. The route then follows Grantchester Meadows Road away from the river before heading across Skater's Meadow to return to the Cam. You then follow the riverside path past Eight Acre Wood before turning towards the village of Grantchester. Here you can enjoy a cream tea at the delightful Orchard Tea Room. It's an idyllic setting with outdoor seating amongst the fruit trees. After refreshments you can either catch a bus back to Cambridge or follow the same route back on foot. If you enjoy this walk you could try the Fen Rivers Way long distance trail. It will take you along the Cam in the other direction, towards the lovely Milton Country Park .",
