  "description": "This woodland nature reserve is located near Corfe Mullen , Wimborne and Poole in Dorset. The site includes a small car park and some pleasant shady footpaths running along a pretty stream. It's a peaceful place with lots of woodland birds to listen and look out for. The Castleman Trailway runs along the western side of the woods. You could pick up this shared cycling and walking trail and follow it south to visit Upton Heath and Upton Country Park . The historic minster at Wimborne lies just to the north.",
