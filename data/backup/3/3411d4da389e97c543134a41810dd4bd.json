  "description": "This walk climbs to Musbury Tor or Tor Hill in the Rossendale Valley. The circular route runs for about 1.5 miles with a moderate climb on the way. The walk starts just to the east of the hill in the village of Helmshore where some parking is available. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south west past Hollin Bank to Tor End. Continue west and you will soon come to the Tor Hill summit. This stands at 340.1 metres (1,116 ft)  and commands fine views over the Alden Valley to its south and Musbury Valley to the north. After taking in the views the route descends on other paths back into Helmshore. There are alternative footpaths to the north along the Musbury Brook if you prefer.",
