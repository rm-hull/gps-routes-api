  "description": "This circular walk explores the coast and countryside surrounding the lovely village of Porthtowan. It's a popular place with a beautiful beach, exhilirating cliff top paths and a series of mine stacks and engine houses dotting the landscape. This 3 mile circular walk starts at the coastal car park and takes you along the South West Coast Path towards Chapel Porth which has a nice little beach. The path then heads through the Chapel Combe valley with views to the passing Great Wheal Charlotte Mine. At Towan Cross you pick up another path taking you through the countryside to the car park. You can extend the walk by following country lanes to Mount Hawke where there is a nice path along a stream. To continue your walking in the area you could follow the South West Coast Path north to St Agnes Head. There's some lovely coastal heathland in this area and the fascinating Wheal Coates former tin mine. You can visit these locations on our St Agnes Head - St Agnes Beacon - Wheal Coates Walk .",
