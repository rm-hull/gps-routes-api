  "description": "This Derbyshire Dales based village is a great base for exploring some of the Peak District's highlights. It's an historic area with a 13th century church and 18th century hall. Neighbouring Little Longstone, further west, has a 17th-century manor house and still has its village stocks. This circular walk from the village takes you up to the viewpoint at Longstone Edge. The limestone ridge stands at 1,300 feet (400 m) in height to the north of the settlement. The walk starts in the village and follows Handrake Lane north east up to the Edge. There's fine views back down to the village and to the surrounding Peak District Hills from this elevated spot. You could extend the walk by continuing north west onto Longstone Moor. This area is described as \"the largest example of limestone heathland in the Peak District National Park\". After exploring the Edge you can then descend back to Great Longstone on alternative footpaths to the west.",
