  "description": "This East Suffolk village is located in a pleasant rural spot, not far from the coast. This walk from the village takes you through the countryside to Cockfield Hall and the River Yox. It follows a pleasant public footpath with nice views across the surrounding countryside. To continue your walking near Yoxford head east to visit the RSPB's Minsmere Nature Reserve where there are some more good footpaths and lots of wildlife to look out for. Neighbouring Westleton can also be found just to the east. There's a pretty village green, a notable 14th century church and a 12th century pub to visit here. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Yoxford. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
