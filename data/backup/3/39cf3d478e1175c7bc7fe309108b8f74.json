The lake in this photo is called Heronry South Lake; no herons were in evidence on this occasion, but a swan can be seen in the shadow of the trees."

  "description": "Follow the River Great Ouse from the source at Brackley , Northamptonshire, to the mouth at The Wash at King's Lynn. You begin at Brackley and head to Buckingham , Milton Keynes , Olney , Bedford, St Neots , Huntingdon, St Ives , Ely , Downham Market before finishing at King's Lynn. Highlights on the route include the magnificent Stowe Park with its 250 acres of stunning parks and gardens. Near Huntingdon you'll pass the National Trust's Houghton Mill . The working 18th-century watermill\u00a0is set in an idyllic location on an island in the river. It's surrounded by lovely water meadows with a number of nice footpaths to follow around the site. You'll also visit Fen Drayton Lakes and the delightful Paxton Pits nature reserve near St Neots. There's a series of lovely lakes and a heronry at this pretty site.",
