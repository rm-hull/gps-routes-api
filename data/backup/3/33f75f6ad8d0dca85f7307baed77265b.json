  "description": "This pretty loch in Cumbernauld has a nice circular trail to follow around the perimeter. You can start the walk at the car park located at the south western end of the lake. Then follow the footpaths round the water for a distance of just under 2 miles. There's nice views over the loch to the Campsie Fells in the distance. If you bring some bread with you then you can spend some time feeding the resident ducks and swans. You can continue your walking around Cumbernauld by heading east to visit Palacerigg Country Park. There's some fine nature trails here with the picturesque Fannyside Lochs, ponds and rare breed animals to see as well.",

Polkemmet Country Park, Roughrigg Reservoir and Forrestburn Reservoir are also not too far away. To the north in Kilsyth there's Banton Loch on the Colzium Estate. The estate also includes the ruins of the 16th century castle, a visitor centre, a garden cafe and a walled garden."
