  "description": "This Worcestershire based village is in a nice spot for country walks and easy strolls along the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. This walk starts from Stoke Wharf and takes you along the canal to visit one of the local highlights at Tardebigge Locks. Here you will find the largest flight of locks in Britan, comprising 30 narrow locks on a 2.25 mile (3.6 km) stretch along the canal. There's also the pretty Tardebigge Reservoir to see in this area. To continue your walking around Stoke Prior head east to visit Upton Warren Nature Reserve. The reserve has some pretty lakes and is said to be Worcestershire\u2019s premier bird-watching reserve. You can find the reserve at postcode B61 7ET. See the video below for more details.",
