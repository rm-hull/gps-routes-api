During winter, this sanctuary becomes a bustling hub for thousands of wildfowl and waders, while in summer, it showcases an array of unique flora. On tranquil summer days, the air is filled with the vibrant sounds of grasshoppers, beetles, skylarks, reed warblers, and nesting redshanks. Amidst the reeds, one may also encounter the distinctive 'ching' call of a bearded reedling or catch a glimpse of a distant marsh harrier. Along the shoreline, keep an eye out for the striking yellow horned-poppy. Within Faversham Creek, saltmarsh plants thrive, including golden samphire, sea-lavender, and sea-purslane, creating a vividly colourful spectacle."

In the winter months, the mudflats and tidal waters of the Swale estuary are teeming with shellfish, worms, and specialised plant life, drawing in vast numbers of birds seeking nourishment as the tide recedes. Wigeon and up to 2,000 Brent geese heavily rely on the eelgrass growing below the high tide mark. Additionally, keep watch for occasional sightings of short-eared owls or hen harriers hunting for small mammals or unsuspecting birds. The merlin is another common winter visitor to the area."
