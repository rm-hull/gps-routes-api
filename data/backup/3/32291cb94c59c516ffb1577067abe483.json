It is named after Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a local unsung hero who lived and worked at Keir Mill about 20 Km to the north-west of Dumfries. He is credited in 1839 with building the first bicycle, thereby initiating a quiet revolution in personal transport. It is the second new footbridge over the Nith to be built in recent years, the first being the Millennium Bridge NY9676 nearer the town centre."

  "description": "This market town is located near the mouth of the River Nith and Solway Firth about 15 miles from the border with England. The town has strong associations with the poet Robert Burns who lived here in the late 1700s. You can visit the Robert Burns centre to find out more about his life and works in a series of exhibitions. The centre is housed in an 18th-century watermill, positioned in a lovely spot on the river. This walk in the town takes you along the River Nith to Kingholm Quay. The walk starts at the Robert Burns Centre and follows a pleasant riverside walking and cycling path south for nearly 2 miles. On the way you will pass the pretty Dock Park, where you'll find the Octocentenary walk and a number of benches to rest and enjoy the view. There's also a series of bridges including the Kirkpatrick Macmillan bridge where you can cross to the other side and enjoy a nice view over the river to the surrounding Scottish hills. To continue your walking around Dumfries head south west to explore Mabie Forest where there's miles of good walking and cycling trails to try. Near here there's also the waterside trails around Loch Arthur. Scroll down for a list of walks near the town.",
