  "description": "This long circular walk makes use of two of the waymarked long distance trails running through the countryside surrounding the Derbyshire town of Belper. There's much to enjoy with waterside paths along the River Derwent and the Cromford Canal. There's also woodland trails and some moderate hills climbs with great views over the Peak District and the Amber Valley. Belper forms part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. The modern factory, or 'mill', system was born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning cotton developed by Richard Arkwright. This walk starts on Belper Bridge, just to the north of the train station, where there are nice views of the Belper Mills. Here you pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way and follow the trail north to Ambergate, passing the pretty Wyver Lane Pool on the way. You then follow the Cromford Canal past Shining Cliff Woods to Crich Carr, where you turn west until you come to the Midshires Way. Follow the trail south through Blackbrook to Farnah Green, where you turn east to head back to the river and the town. You'll pass the delightful Belper Riverside Gardens which have been offering visitors a tranquil setting to view the River Derwent for over 100 years. To extend your walk you could continue south along the Midshires Way towards Duffield and Derby. In this area you can visit Allestree Park and Kedleston Hall. A few miles to the west is the splendid Carsington Water where there are some great waterside walking and cycling trails to try.",
