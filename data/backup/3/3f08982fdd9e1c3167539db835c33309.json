  "description": "This circular walk visits the Marine Nature Reserve at Lough Hyne in West Cork near Skibbereen. The walk runs for about 8km, following trails along the western side of the lough before returning on alternative tracks just to the west of the water. You can start and end the walk from the car park at the northern end of the lough near Knockomagh Wood and the Lough Hyne Forest. Just to the north of the car park there's the Knockomagh Summit if you would like to extend your hike. From here there are fantastic views back down to the lough, over to Baltimore, Sherkin Island and the open Atlantic sea. If you were to head into nearby Skibbereen you could visit the Heritage Centre and find out more about the lough's features and biodiversity. These include environments such as cliffs, salt marsh and beach which are the subject of continual study.",

      "content": "Head east along the coast and you could pick up the popular Seven Heads Walk. There's a long circular trail to follow around the picturesque peninsula with pretty seaside villages, lovely beaches and bays. The trail is located near the delightful town of Clonakilty. The vibrant seaside town has a fine walk along Clonakilty Harbour to Inchydoney Island where there's a lovely blue flag beach. Near here there's also Galley Head where you can explore the sand dunes at Long Strand beach before heading towards the 19th century lighthouse at the end of the headland. Also the east is the Courtmacsherry Loop Walk around the delightful village of Courtmacsherry. The area is well known for its attractive harbour and beautiful deep purple fuchsia in late summer. To the west there's Mizen Head which is traditionally regarded as the most southerly point of mainland Ireland. The stunning coastal area includes the Mizen Head Signal Station & Visitor Centre where you can learn all about this special area. Near here there's also Cape Clear, Ireland\u2019s southernmost inhabited Irish-speaking island. It's another wonderful, peaceful place for a walk with lots of wildlife and great views back to Mizen Head. To the north there's the Sheeps Head Way. The circular loop walk explores the stunning Sheep's Head peninsula from the attractive town of Bantry."
