  "description": "This circular walk visits the Marine Nature Reserve at Lough Hyne in West Cork near Skibbereen. The walk runs for about 8km, following trails along the western side of the lough before returning on alternative tracks just to the west of the water. You can start and end the walk from the car park at the northern end of the lough near Knockomagh Wood and the Lough Hyne Forest. Just to the north of the car park there's the Knockomagh Summit if you would like to extend your hike. From here there are fantastic views back down to the lough, over to Baltimore, Sherkin Island and the open Atlantic sea. If you were to head into nearby Skibbereen you could visit the Heritage Centre and find out more about the lough's features and biodiversity. These include environments such as cliffs, salt marsh and beach which are the subject of continual study.",
