  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the Essex Coast on this easy promenade walk between Frinton-on-Sea and Walton-on-the-Naze. The walk runs for about 2 miles on a nice flat path with views of the beach and sea. You can start off from the car park on the front at the Greensward in Frinton. Then head north along the path, passing all the little beach huts, the Clock Tower and the sea defence wall before finishing at Walton pier. You can extend the walk by heading slightly inland to visit Walton Mere which has a nice footpath to follow along the water. There's also the Walton on the Naze Crag Walk which takes you to the coastal defence structures built to protect the cliffs against erosion. Near here you can also visit the 18th century Naze Tower and explore the Hamford Water Nature Reserve. The area is an internationally important site for migrating birds and includes the famous fifty million year old cliffs\u00a0made up of London clay. You may also see Common and Grey Seals in the area too.",
