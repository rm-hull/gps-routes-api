The Wisbech Canal (opened in 1797) - planned as a means to improve the status of Wisbech as a trading centre - linked the River Nene at Wisbech with Well Creek at Outwell. Sections which were not buried under the new road (A1101) have been planted with trees and can be walked."

    "description": "The Cambrideshire town of Wisbech has some nice flat riverside trails to try. There's also some easy country trails running through the surrounding Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire countryside. This walk from the town takes you north along the River Nene to the point where it enters The Wash. It follows a section of the waymarked Nene Way through Tydd Gote and Sutton Bridge to the coast. It's a long but easy walk along a flat path with nice country views on the way. The walk starts to the west of the town centre next to Peckover House and Garden . This National Trust owned house was built in 1722 and bought by Jonathan Peckover at the end of the 18th century. Near here you can pick up the Nene Way and follow it north towards Tydd Gote and Sutton Bridge . The route continues north to the point where the river enters the sea at The Wash. Here you can see two towers known as \"the lighthouses\".",
