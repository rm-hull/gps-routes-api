  "description": "This walk visits the most northerly point of both mainland Scotland and the island of Great Britain. The headland is located just north west of the more famous John O' Groats. There is a car parking area near to the lighthouse at the northern tip of the headland. From here you can pick up coastal paths in either direction. This circular walk takes you along the coast before heading around a series of pretty lochs. Along the way there are some fabulous cliff top sea views and a wide variety of seabirds to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for guillemots, fulmars, kittiwakes, puffins, great skuas, arctic skuas, razorbills, gannets and herring gulls. Also look out for seals in the waters below. To continue your walking in the area head east to visit the photogenic Duncansby Stacks. The impressive sea stacks are located off Duncansby Head, the most northeasterly point of both the Scottish and British mainlands.",
