  "description": "This small reservoir sits in a lovely spot on the Llangollen branch of the Shropshire Union Canal near Nantwich. There are grassy footpaths running alongside the pretty lake with the option to extend your walk along the adjacent canal towpath. Heading north would take you towards Barbridge while heading south will take you into Nantwich. The impressive Hurleston Lock flight is also located in the area. The lake is also good for wildlife with various wildfowl visitors and fish.",
