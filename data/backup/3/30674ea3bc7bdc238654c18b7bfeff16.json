  "description": "Walk along this long shingle spit to one of Henry VIII's Device Forts on this lovely coastal walk in Hampshire. The walk starts at Keyhaven in between The walk starts at Keyhaven in between Lymington and Milford on Sea. You follow the shingle spit for about 1.5 miles out to the castle where there are splendid views of the nearby Isle of Wight and the south coast. The striking coastal structure is an artillery fort established by Henry VIII between 1541 and 1544. It formed part of the king's Device Forts coastal protection programme against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the western entrance to the Solent waterway. English Heritage own the site so you can explore the castle for a reasonable fee. There's interesting exhibitions around the castle which provide you with a chance to piece together Hurst Castle's long history. Highlights include spectacular views from the roof of the Tudor keep across The Needles Passage to the Isle of Wight. The Keep is also notable as the place where Charles I was probably kept prisoner in 1648. If you would like to continue your walk you could follow the sea wall through Keyhaven Marshes towards Lymington. It's about an 8 mile walk to the castle from the town using a lovely section of the Solent Way long distance trail. You can see more details on the Solent Way Walk Lymington .",
