  "description": "This walk climbs to Angletarn Pikes from Patterdale in the Lake District. The area is a favourite of many with Angle Tarn considered one of the most beautiful spots in the Lake District. Alfred Wainwright described it as\u00a0'among the best of Lakeland tarns'. On the walk you will also enjoy super views over Ullswater Lake and the surrounding fells. The walk starts at the parking area in Patterdale and climbs to Boredale Hause. You continue to Stony Rigg and then on to Angletarn Pikes. The Pikes are named after the two rocky towers at the summit, separated by a long section of peaty bog. From here there are great views down to Angle Tarn and over to the Helvellyn\u00a0range and the\u00a0Far Eastern Fells\u00a0across Martindale. You then descend to the tarn for a waterside section before returning to Patterdale on the same route. Alternatively, you could continue past the tarn and head towards The Knott and Hayeswater to extend your walk. Brothers Water is also nearby and is another good walk to try in the area.",
