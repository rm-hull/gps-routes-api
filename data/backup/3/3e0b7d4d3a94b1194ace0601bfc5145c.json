  "description": "This small Cumbrian village is located in the Lake District's beautiful Eskdale. It's a fine place to explore on foot with a tarn, woods, a Japanese Garden, riverside trails and two fine historic pubs for refreshment after your exercise. The village is accessible on the heritage Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway at Eskdale Green station or Irton Road Station. In the village there's a pretty tarn next to the Gate House Mansion where you will find an Outward Bound Centre. The centre organises educational outdoor adventure activities such as rafting on the tarn, walking up a mountain or canoeing down the river. From the station you can head north and follow footpaths past the tarn to the Giggle Alley Forest. There's nice woodland trails here with a pretty Japanese Garden designed by Thomas Mawson. You then climb around the back of the Gate House where you can enjoy some fine views over the area from Fell End. The walk then descends past Fishergate Farm to the River Esk where you can follow a riverside path along Milkinstead Woods. To continue your walking in the area head west to climb to Muncaster Fell and Muncaster Castle where there's more great views and beautiful castle gardens to explore.",

There's lovely views across the Irt Estuary Nature Reserve with its abundance of wildlife here. A couple of miles to the north west there's the climb to Irton Pike. There's some excellent views to Wast Water from this fine viewpoint. You can try the circular walk from Santon Bridge to visit the Pike and Irton Fell.
