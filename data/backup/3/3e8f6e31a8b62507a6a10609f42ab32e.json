  "description": "Sycamore Gap was voted England's tree of the year in 2016. It stands in a dramatic dip next to Hadrian's wall in the Northumberland National Park. The tree is known as the 'Robin Hood' tree after famously featuring in the film 'Robin Hood Prince of Thieves' starring Kevin Costner. This circular walk makes use of the Hadrian's Wall Path and the Pennine Way to take you to the iconic tree and around the pretty Crag Lough . The walk starts at the Steel Rigg car park just to the west of the tree. You then pick up the footpath to Steel Rigg and on to Sycamore Gap. After taking some photos of the strikingly positioned tree the path continues around Crag Lough. The route then follows public footpaths back to the car park, passing Hound Hill on the way. You can extend your walk by continuing east along the path to Hotbank Crags and Housesteads Wood. Here you can physically walk on Hadrian's Wall for a short section. There's some magnificent views on this elevated section of the path. If you keep heading east you will soon come to the famous Housteads Roman Fort. The fascinating fort dates from \u00a0AD 124 and is well worth a visit. The  barracks block, hospital, Commander's House, granaries and communal toilets are all still visible today. You can virtually explore the footpath around Sycamore Gap on the google street view link below. N.B Sadly the iconic tree was felled in the early morning of 28th September 2023 in an act of vandalism. It is hoped the tree will regrow but will not be the same again.",
