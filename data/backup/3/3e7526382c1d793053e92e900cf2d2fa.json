  "description": "This little village is located a few miles north east of the city of York. There's some nice local trails to follow around some attractive farmland. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring settlements of Warthill and Holtby. The walk starts in the village and follows Carrbank Lane through pleasant farmland towards Warthill where there's a nice village pond, a good local pub and an old church. You then head west along Rudcarr Lane before turning south to visit Holtby.\nThe route then returns to Stockton via the farmland around Beanland Lane.",
