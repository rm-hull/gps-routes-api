  "description": "This cycle or walk along a dismantled railway line runs from Stonebridge to Crook through the beautiful Deerness Valley. The path passes the villages of Ushaw Moor and Esh Winning and and woodland at Holburn and Woodhouses Wood. There are also lovely waterside stretches along the River Deerness to enjoy. The path can be accessed to the west of the city of Durham. The Brandon - Bishop Auckland Walk and the Lanchester Valley Walk run very close to the trail. They also run along disused railway lines and are a great way to further explore the area.",
