  "description": "This delightful little hamlet is located in the High Peak area of Derbyshire, near New Mills and Marple Bridge. It's a nice place to start a walk with plenty of local trails and a noteworthy old pub for refreshments after your exercise. This route from the village uses sections of the Cown Edge Way and the Pennine Bridleway to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. At the northern end of the route there is a small detour to visit Cown Edge Rocks where there is some wonderful rock formations and tremendous views over the Peak District. To continue your walking around Rowarth head south east and enjoy a climb to Lantern Pike for more great views over the area.",
