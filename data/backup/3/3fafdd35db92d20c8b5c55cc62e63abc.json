  "description": "Hamsterley Forest is a great place for exciting mountain bike trails, leisurely family cycle rides or peaceful woodland walking. There are three colour coded, way-marked mountain bike trails in the forest. The blue trail follows purpose built cycle tracks and the Bedburn Beck through the southern part of the forest at a leisurely pace. It's suitable for families and people looking for a gentle introduction to off road cycling. The red trail goes further into the forest and climbs to a point with fabulous views of the surrounding area before descending on an exciting single track running along Euden Beck. The black trail is the most severe trail and suitable for experienced mountain bikers. Cycle hire is available from the start of route below. Walkers will find five way-marked trails of varying lengths and difficulty to follow. These include an easy, riverside stroll along Bedburn Beck and longer trails with climbs and a visit to Blackling Hole waterfall. The route mapped out below is suitable for both leisure walkers and cyclists looking for a fairly easy ride. The forest also includes a Gruffalo Sculptures trail where you can see some of the characters from Julia Donaldson's children's story. This is a nice one for families to do. The splendidly named mtb trails, jumps and loops can be seen marked blue in the open street map link below. These include Brain Freeze, When in Loam, Special K, Boneshaker, Two Wheels and a Troll, Nitrous, Accelerator, Transmission, Polty's Last Blast and K-Line.",
