The church was built in a free Early English style, with tall lancet windows throughout, to designs of J.H.Good Jr., for Baron Rutzen of Slebech Park. It is constructed of grey limestone ashlar, generally with a pecked finish and some chiselling, slate roofs with large ogee gutters over a corbelled cornice, and two-stage buttresses with those at the corners capped with lumpish pinnacles."

  "description": "This 600 acre estate is covered with miles of footpaths making it an excellent location for walkers. It sits on the Dau cleddau river Estuary and consists of Bluebell covered Beech wood, wildflower meadows and riverside paths. This circular walk starts from the car park and follows a very good path around the estate passing woodland and ponds. You finish with a riverside stretch along the Dau cleddau river. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head a mile or so west to the wonderful Picton Castle Gardens. Canaston Woods is also nearby and has miles of good cycling and walking trails to try. Slebech Park is located a few miles east of Haverfordwest .",
