  "description": "This Surrey based village is located in the Tandridge district of the county. With a fine local nature reserve and access to the North Downs it's a good place to start a walk. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Vanguard Way, the North Downs Way and the Woldingham Countryside Walk to explore the woodland and countryside to the south of the village. Along the way you'll enjoy fine views over the surrounding countryside of the North Downs. The walk starts at the Blanchman's Farm Local Nature Reserve on Limpsfield Rd in the village. The reserve is a nice place for a stroll in the heart of the Warlingham. In the reserve there's a nature trail, two summer meadows, a pond, a central wooded area, hazel coppice, a newly planted orchard and horse grazing. It's also great for wildlife with roe deer, foxes and a variety of birds to look out for. After exploring the reserve the route then follows footpaths south and then east towards Chelsham and Henley Wood. The route then heads south towards Nore Hill and Botley Hill along the Vanguard Way. Botley Hill is notable as the highest point in the North Downs. There's some fine views and a 16th century farmhouse pub in this area. The route then turns west along the Pilgrim's Way to Oxted Quarry and Gangers Hill. You then head north past Marden Park and Woldingham before returning to Warlingham.",

It has a delightful old interior with low beams and nooks and crannies. Outside there's a good sized garden area for warmer days. You can find them at 3 Farleigh Road, CR6 9EG."
