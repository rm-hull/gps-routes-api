  "description": "Climb to the top of this iconic hill in the Chilterns on this walk in Buckinghamshire. Ivinghoe Beacon stands at 233 m (757 ft) and commands fine views over the Chiltern Hills and the Vale of Aylesbury. The walk starts from the car park next to Pitstone Windmill and makes use of the Icknield Way Path to take you to the summit. The Pitstone Windmill has been restored by the National trust and is well worth a visit before you begin your climb to Beacon Hill. On the way you'll pass through chalk grassland and woodland with a wide variety of wildlife to look out for. For a longer circular walk to the summit you can use the Icknield Way Path and the Ashridge Boundary Trail from the Ashridge Estate. Our Chilterns Pub Walk from Aldbury starts in the pretty village and also visit Gallows Hill to create a loop around the hill. If you'd like to further continue your walking in the area then you could enjoy waterside walking along the nearby Grand Union Canal or continue exploring the Icknield Way Path. You could follow the trail south onto the nearby Ashridge Estate and pick up the Ashridge Boundary Trail. In the park there's miles of woodland trails, a variety of wildlife and the Bridgewater Monument, erected in 1832 to the Duke of Bridgewater. Following the Icknield Way east will take you to the popular Dunstable Downs Country Park. The park includes the wonderful Whipsnade Tree Cathedral and The Five Knolls Bronze Age cemetery constructed over 4000 years ago.",
