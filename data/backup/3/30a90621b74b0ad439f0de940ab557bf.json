  "description": "This walk visits Llyn Llydaw on the flanks of\u00a0Snowdon, about one-third of the way up the mountain. It's one of the most visited lakes in the\u00a0United Kingdom with thousands of people passing it each year on their way up to the Snowdon summit.  It's a nice one to do if you want to explore the mountain without doing the full, more strenuous climb. The walk starts from the Pen y Pass car park and follows the Snowdon Miners Track up to LLyn Teyrn. Soon after you come to the much larger Llyn Llydaw where you can cross the causeway to the other side. There's a nice path along the northern side of the lake which you can follow up to Lake Glaslyn to extend the walk. The walk descends the same way back to the car park where you can enjoy refreshments in the cafe. To continue your walking in the area you can head along the Afon Trawsnant and the Afon Glaslyn to Llyn Gwynant where there is a nice circular trail to try.",
