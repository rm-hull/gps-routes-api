When this reservoir is full, the long-term settlement of the earth dam can be clearly seen (follow the line of the bottom of the wave wall, compared with the water surface which must be horizontal). In the middle distance is the valve tower, and the buildings on the far side are the water treatment works."

  "description": "This walk visits Brownhill Reservoir near Holmfirth. There's a car park at the southern end of the water where you can start your walk. You can then follow footpaths heading down towards the dam and the adjacent Ramsden Reservoir. There's also a nice country lane running to the east of the lakes. The path sits above the two reservoirs providing fine views down to the two picturesque bodies of water. It's suitable for walkers or cyclists and name Brownhill Lane.",
