  "description": "Enjoy a walk to the summit of England's most southerley fell on this wonderful circular walk in the Forest of Bowland. The walk begins at the car park at Turner Fold and takes you to the 1,148-ft (350-m) summit on woodland footpaths. There are fabulous views from the high point including the Fylde Coast, the Vale of Chipping, the fells of the Forest of Bowland (including Parlick, Fair Snape Fell and Beacon Fell), the Yorkshire Dales and on a clear day the Lake District fells. Longridge Fell is situated to the north of both Preston and Blackburn. The long distance Forest of Bowland Walk passes the fell. The circular route explores the AONB, visiting several of the highlights. It's a great way of extending your walking in this beautiful area. The historical village of Ribchester lies at the foot of the fell. The village includes ruins of an old Roman Fort and nice riverside trails along the River Ribble. You could also reach the fell by following trails from the nearby village of Chipping . The trails will take you to the fell via the River Hodder , approaching from the north west.",
