  "description": "Explore the Isle of Axholme Greenway on this circular walk through the Lincolnshire countryside. The name Isle is given to the area since, prior to the area being drained by the Dutchman Cornelius Vermuyden, each town or village formerly lay on areas of dry, raised ground in the surrounding marshland. The walk visits Epworth, Westwoodside and Haxey and the delightful Birds Wood Nature Reserve. There is also a pleasant waterside section along the River Tome.",
