  "description": "This walk follows a section of the West Highland Way from Bridge of Orchy to Kingshouse Hotel in the Scottish Highlands. The route runs for about 12 miles, following the waymarked footpath through some stunning scenery. You'll cross rivers, pass picturesque lochans and enjoy fabulous views of Glencoe. The route starts off in Bridge of Orchy and follows the trail north west along the Old Military Road to the Inveroran Hotel. You continue past the western side of Loch Tulla before passing Black Mount and the Ski Centre. The walk then finishes at the Kingshouse Hotel in Glencoe, next to the River Etive. Here you can expect a warm welcome with roaring fires and comfy rooms. Just to the west of the hotel you can extend the walk by visiting Buachaille Etive Mor, a distinctive pyramid shaped mountain in Glen Etive. To continue your walk pick up the next section on the Kingshouse to Kinlochleven Walk. At the southern end of the route you can link with the Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy section of the trail.",
