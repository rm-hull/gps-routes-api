  "description": "This interesting Gloucestershire village has a pretty local lake, country trails and lots of woodland to explore in the surrounding Forest of Dean. The historic town centre is also well worth exploring with the 17th century market hall and a number of listed 13th century buildings to admire. This walk from the town visits The National Bird of Prey Centre and Newent Woods before climbing to the viewpoint at May Hill . The walk starts in the town and follows country lanes south to the International Birds of Prey Centre in Boulsdon. The centre is one of the main attractions in the area and located within walking distance of the town. It is notable as the oldest dedicated birds of prey centre in the world. You can explore the 12 acre grounds where you can see over 250 birds of prey including eagles, owls, vultures, kites, buzzards and falcons. The route then continues south to enter Newent Woods. There's miles of peaceful trails here with ponds and wildlife to look out for on the way. Follow the trails along the western side of the woods and you will soon come to May Hill. The hill sits in a lovely spot on the Gloucestershire/Herefordshire border with excellent views into both counties from the top. On the hill you can pick up a section of the long distance Gloucestershire Way and follow the waymarked trail south past Bearfoot Wood towards Dursley Cross. Near here you pick up the Wysis Way and follow it north east towards Glasshouse. You then head north past Clifford Manor, following woodland trails towards Clifford's Mesne. The route then leaves the woods to retrace your steps back to Newent, passing the Birds of Prey Centre as you go.",
