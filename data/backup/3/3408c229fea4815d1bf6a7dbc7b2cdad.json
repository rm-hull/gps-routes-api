    "description": "This North Yorkshire village is located in a lovely rural spot near Reeth in the Yorkshire Dales. This circular walk from the village takes you along the River Swale to Marrick Priory before heading onto Cogden Moor for some wonderful views over the area. The historic priory was a Benedictine nunnery established between 1140 and 1160 by Roger de Aske. Today it has been converted into an outdoor education and residential centre for young people, providing activities such as rock climbing, abseiling, open canoeing, kayaking, caving, ropes course, zip wire, orienteering and team building. After exploring the priory the walk then heads south, crossing the River Swale before coming to Bleaberry Hill. You then follow a country lane north east to meet with Cogden Gill. There's a footpath running north along the picturesque gill which leads back towards the village. On the walk there's also some wonderful views of the rolling hills of Swaledale. To continue your walking in the area head north to try the popular Fremington Edge Walk where there's more splendid views on the ridge top path.",
