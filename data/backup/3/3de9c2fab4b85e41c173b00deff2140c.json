    "description": "This little village is generally agreed to be one of the prettiest in Worcestershire. With delightul little cottages, a village pond and an old church dating from the 12th century, it's a typical picture postcard English village. This circular walk from Elmley takes you to Bredon Hill and the Banbury Stone Tower. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths south east to join with the Wychavon Way . This long distance trail will take you south west past the deer park and the site of the old castle after which the village is named. Continue past Fillder's Knap and you can pick up bridleways leading towards Bredon Hill. The hill summit stands at a height of 299 m (981 ft), providing wonderful views over the Cotswold Hills. It's also a historically significant area with the Iron Age Hill Fort of Kemerton Camp and a small stone tower known as Parsons Folly or Banbury Stone Tower. The route rounds the hill, passing the neighbouring village of Overbury before descending past Comberton Wood and Windmill Hill to Elmley.",
