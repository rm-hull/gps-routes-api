The station comprised a remarkable array of buildings and employed several hundred individuals who facilitated the transmission of news across the ocean from 1907 to 1922. Unfortunately, it was ravaged by fire during the Irish War of Independence. Nonetheless, the foundations of the buildings and workers\u2019 residences still remain visible today."

  "description": "Derrigimlagh Bog is recognised as one of the Signature Discovery Points along the Wild Atlantic Way lon distance trail. It is a distinctive and picturesque expanse of blanket peat bog and lakes, valued not only for its abundant and varied wildlife and flora, but also for its role in two significant events in the history of international travel and communication. You can park at the car park at the Wild Atlantic Way Signature Discovery Point at Derrigimlagh. From here you follow the Marconi Street south to visit the Alcock and Brown Monument and the site of the Marconis Transmitting station. The remote and secluded location served as the crash site for John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in 1919, during their historic non-stop flight across the Atlantic. Departing from Newfoundland 16 hours earlier on the morning of June 15, 1919, they made their mark in history with this remarkable feat. The crash site is now commemorated by a white memorial shaped like an aeroplane wing. Recently, a new walkway has been constructed through the bog, featuring interactive information points that narrate the fascinating history of this area. Through these binocular-style information points, visitors can view the current landscape overlaid with images depicting the view as it appeared in the early 20th century. You'll also visit the site of the Marconi wireless transmitting station. More than a century ago, the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi set up the world\u2019s inaugural permanent transatlantic radio station at Derrigimlagh.",

      "content": "Just to the north there's the ruins of Clifden Castle to explore. The grounds of the striking Gothic Revival house include fine views of Clifden Bay. There's also the scenic Sky Road to pick up in this area. Near Clifden there's more local historic interest at the 19th century Kylemore Abbey. The popular estate includes loughside trails, a Victorian walled garden, woodland paths and views of the surrounding Twelve Bens Mountains. Near here there's also the stunning Killary Fjord. There's some wonderful scenery here with the fjord flanked by the mountains of Mweelrea and Ben Gorm. To the north west there's Cleggan where you can catch the ferry to Inishbofin island. There's a waymarked circular loop walk here passing rugged cliffs, a photogenic ruined fort, pretty lakes and stone beaches. Near here there's also Clare Island which you can reach from Roonagh Pier near the small town of Louisburgh. The island has strong associations with the notorious Grace O'Malley, the 'pirate queen' of the 16th century. Head east and you can explore the beautiful grounds of the 18th century Ballynahinch Castle. Here you can enjoy beautiful gardens, a picturesque lake, ancient woodland and glorious views of the surrounding Twelve Bens mountain range."
