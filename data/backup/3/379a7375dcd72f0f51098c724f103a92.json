Chapel House (right) and part of the former chapel of St Bartholomew (left), Botesdale, Suffolk, seen from the north.\nSt Bartholomew's was founded as a chantry chapel in the late 14th or early 15th century. The chantry was suppressed in the Reformation in the 16th century. The chapel was converted into a grammar school and in 1576 the house was added for the schoolmaster. In 1883 the chapel was restored to use for worship as a chapel of ease to the parish of St Mary the Virgin, Redgrave. It has now again ceased to be used for worship."
