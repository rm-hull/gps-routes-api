  "description": "This Buckinghamshire based village is located in the Chiltern Hills just west of Great Missenden. This walk visits the Prestwood Local Nature Reserve which is located just south west of the village. The pleasant little reserve is a nice place for a short stroll with wildflowers, chalk grassland and lots of wildlife to see. Trees include maple, cherry, beech, walnut and even the rare wild pear. You may also see wildlife including mice, voles, muntjac deer and a variety of birds. The walk can be started from the car park off Hampden Road near Perks Lane. There's also some picnic tables.",
