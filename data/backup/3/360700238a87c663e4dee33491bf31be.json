Another board provides the following information: The nature reserve covers over 1,500 hectares of coastal mudflats, saltmarsh, sand dunes and saline lagoons at the mouth of the Humber estuary. The saltmarsh supports an important population of breeding redshanks, along with many pairs of skylarks and reed buntings. Thousands of ducks, geese and wading birds feed and roost on the mudflats from midsummer until spring. Birds of prey such as peregrines and merlins hunt over the reserve in winter. Fitties Lagoon is home to the nationally rare lagoon sand shrimp. Blue sea lavender flowers on the saltmarsh in summer."

A unique 'plot land' development of holiday chalets which began at the end of the First World War. The chalets are mainly timber construction with some concrete panelled ones introduced in the 1950's & 1960's. There is a simple road system, no lighting and an open aspect, which is complemented by picket fencing only a metre high. The Area is adjacent to the beach and was reclaimed from marshland, which results in a high water table and is further subject to possible flooding. Occupation is only allowed for 10 months from 1st March."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from the outskirts of Cleethorpes to Tetney Lock on the Louth Canal. You'll pass along the coast and the Tetney Marshes Nature Reserve where there's lots of coastal wildlife to look out for. The reserve is run by the RSPB and includes coastal mudflats, salt marsh, dunes and saline lagoons. Look out for little terns, redshanks and reed buntings as you make your way along the path. You can start the walk from the public car park at Humberston Fitties, just south of the Pleasure Island amusements. From here you can pick up a footpath heading south east along the coast towards Tetney Haven. Here you pick up the canal and follow it west to Tetney Lock. After admiring the lock you can then follow other inland footpaths north back to the car park.",

At the lock you can also pick up the Louth Canal and follow it south towards the tranquil Covenham Reservoir. Also nearby is Weelsby Woods. This popular park has some nice surfaced footpaths taking you to mature trees, woodland, and large grassy areas. The Grimsby Walk starts from the train station in the town and visits the interesting National Fishing Heritage Centre at Alexandra Dock. The museum transports you back in time to the 1950\u2019s heyday of this famous port. If you head a few miles west you could pick up the Wanderlust Way around the little village of Barnoldby le Beck. The 20 mile circular walk explores the Lincolnshire Wolds and includes views of the Humber Estuary. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lincolnshire Walks page."
