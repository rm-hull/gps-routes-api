  "description": "This waymarked long distance trail runs for 80km through County Sligo from Lough Talt to Dromahair in County Leitrim. The trail starts at the picturesque Lough Talt near Larrigan and heads east passing the Ox Mountains and Lough Easkey and Coolaney before following country lanes to Collooney. From here you follow the peaceful trails through Union Wood before passing Ballygawley Lough. The final section takes you through Slish Woods, following the shore of Lough Gill to reach the end of the route at Dromahair. Along the way there are some moderate climbs with glorious views of Ben Bulben, Donegal Bay, Slieve League and the Nephin mountain range to enjoy.",
