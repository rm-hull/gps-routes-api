Originally it was housed in the Speyside orphanage building in the square. This was removed in the 1980s when this was converted to flats. With generous funding from the Bulmer Trust, Grantown Museum was able, in 2006, to restore the clock and build this campanile outside the museum to house the bell. The clock is on display within the museum."

  "description": "This splendid route is one of the four official Long Distance Routes in Scotland. It follows the River Spey from Buckie, on the Moray Firth, to Aviemore . You will pass Craigellachie , Grantown on Spey and Boat of Garten with coastal and riverside sections to enjoy. There are also terrific views of the Cairngorm Mountains as you approach Aviemore. The trail is often completed in the following sections: Section 1 - Buckie to Spey Bay Section 2 - Spey Bay to Fochabers Section 3 - Fochabers to Craigellachie Section 4 - Craigellachie to Ballindalloch Section 5 - Ballindalloch to Grantown Section 6 - Grantown On Spey to Nethy Bridge Section 7 - Nethy Bridge to Boat of Garten Section 8 - Boat of Garten to Aviemore This route has been classified as a walking and cycle route but not all of the trail is suitable for cycling. The off road sections between Ballindalloch and Tomintoul, and between Ballindalloch and Cromdale should be avoided on bikes. However the sections between Fochabers and Ballindalloch and between Nethy Bridge and Aviemore make for excellent cycling. The final section from Boat of Garten to Aviemore, is actually part of the Sustrans millennium cycle way so is also suitable for cycling.",
