  "description": "This Derbyshire based town has some nice riverside trails, the remains of an old castle and a fine heritage railway to enjoy. There's also a range of good public footpaths on which to explore the surrounding Amber Valley countryside. This walk from the town visits the pretty Duffield Millennium Meadows Nature Reserve before heading to Duffield Castle and the neighbouring village of Milford. The walk starts from the train station where it's a short stroll to the Millenium Meadows (or Eyes Meadow) Nature Reserve. Here you'll find nice riverside trails along the River Ecclesbourne and River Derwent which run through the town. It's also a good spot for wildlife watching with several species of water loving birds visiting the meadows. After exploring the reserve you can pick up a section of the Midshires Way and follow the waymarked footpath north to visit the site of Duffield Castle. The historic site dates from the 11th century but was largely destroyed in the 13th century. The route then continues north into the countryside along the Midshires Way before turning east to visit Milford. It's a pretty riverside village with an old bridge and rushing weirs. You can cross the bridge to visit nearby Makeney if you would like to extend the walk.",
