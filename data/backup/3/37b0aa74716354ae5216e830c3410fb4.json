  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path from Blakeney to Salthouse. The route runs for just over 6 miles, following a flat, waymarked footpath. On the route there's some lovely coastal scenery with views towards Blakeney Point and the Cley Marshes Nature Reserve. The reserve consists of 430 acres of reed beds, freshwater marsh, pools and wet meadows. Look out for lots of water loving wildlife as you make your way along the path. These include seals, avocet, western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. In Salthouse you could pay a visit to the noteworthy St Nicholas' church. The medieval church dates to the 1200s and sits in a fine location on a hill, offering splendid views along the coast and out to sea.",
