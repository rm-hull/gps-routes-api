  "description": "A circular walk around Welton Dale in East Riding of Yorkshire. The walk makes use of the Yorkshire Wolds Way and Beverley Twenty to create a circular walk around the village and its associated dale. The walk starts in the pretty village of Welton which lies at the southern end of the dale. From here you can pick up the Wolds Way and follow the waymarked path north past the mill pond and through the dale. It's a very picturesque area with attractive woodland and lots of flora and fauna to see. After a while you come out of the woodland and into the countryside where you'll pass Wauldby Dam before arriving at Turtle Hill. You could branch of to the west here and visit Brantingham but this trail turns round to return to the woods and pick up the Beverley Twenty. It will take you past Welton Wold Farm and the Welton Wold Plantation before returning to the village.",

      "content": "Welton is located close to Hessle and the River Humber. To continue your walking you could follow the Beverley Twenty and the Trans Pennine Trail to Humber Bridge Country Park. Here you can enjoy the parkland before climbing up to Humber Bridge and walking across the river on the iconic structure. In Hessle you can also pick up the popular Hessle Foreshore Walk and follow the trail east to Hull. The South Cave circular walk starts from the nearby village and visits Welton Dale. It will also take you to Brantinghmam, Cave Wold and Great Wold with some lovely rolling countryside to enjoy. Just a few miles to the north east you'll find the worthy villages of Cottingham and Skidby. The main attraction here is the Grade II listed Skidby Mill which dates back to 1821. The working mill includes an interesting museum and a fine restaurant with a landscaped garden. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Wolds Walks page.
