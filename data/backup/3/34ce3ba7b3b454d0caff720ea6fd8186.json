  "description": "A circular walk around Welton Dale in East Riding of Yorkshire. The walk makes use of the Yorkshire Wolds Way and Beverley Twenty to create a circular walk around the village and its associated dale. The walk starts in the pretty village of Welton which lies at the southern end of the dale. From here you can pick up the Wolds Way and follow the waymarked path north past the mill pond and through the dale. It's a very picturesque area with attractive woodland and lots of flora and fauna to see. After a while you come out of the woodland and into the countryside where you'll pass Wauldby Dam before arriving at Turtle Hill. You could branch of to the west here and visit Brantingham but this trail turns round to return to the woods and pick up the Beverley Twenty. It will take you past Welton Wold Farm and the Welton Wold Plantation before returning to the village.",
