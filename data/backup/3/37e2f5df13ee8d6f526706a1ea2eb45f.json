  "description": "Visit this beautiful island off the Devon coast and enjoy coastal walks and a variety of wildlife. The island is designated as a marine national nature reserve so bring your binoculars to look out for the seals and puffins that visit the island. You can reach the island by catching a boat from Bideford or Ilfracombe from mid March to the end of October. It's a splendid place for walkers with miles of footpaths taking you to rugged cliffs, coastal viewpoints and grassy slopes with wildflowers in the summer. Look out for wildlife which includes sika deer, wild goats and the only native mammal, the pygmy shrew. Birdlife includes puffins, chaffinches and stonechats while butterflies such as the Red Admiral can be seen in the summer. The seas around Lundy are home to fascinating marine wildlife such as cup corals, pink sea fans and sponges. Keep your eyes peeled for grey seals, basking sharks and killer whales too. There's also a terrific climb on the west side of the island where you can enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding area.",
