  "description": "Explore the stunning grounds of this 19th century castle and former residence of Catherine of Aragon. There are 500 acres of beautiful parkland, open water and formal gardens to explore on well laid out walking paths. You can enjoy a waterside stroll along the River Len in the delightful Wood Garden with its Azaleas and Rhododendrons. The Culpeper Garden is also stunning with floral displays including Roses, Lupins, Poppies and Lads' Love. The Mediterranean Garden Terrace is also popular with a south facing aspect, authentic Mediterranean style, and superb views across the Great Water. Other attractions include a unique maze with 2,400 yew trees and an underworld grotto, with macabre forms and mythical beasts created from shells, minerals and wood. There are also super Falconry Displays with different birds of prey including Owls, Hawks, Falcons to Eagles. Tours of the castle are well worthwhile with its magnificent state rooms, exquisite furnishings and historic paintings.",

      "content": "The Kingswood Walk visits the castle from the village to the south. Head south to Sutton Valence and you can pick up the Greensand Way. This major long distance walk follows the ridge of greensand rock through Surrey and Kent. Here you can also visit the ruins of the 12th century Sutton Valence Castle for some more local history. You can then climb up to the castle and enjoy wonderful views over East Sussex and the Weald of Kent. Just to the east there's the village of Harrietsham where you can pick up the circular bluebell woodland walk. The walk includes a visit to the noteworthy Ringlestone Inn, a beautiful grade II listed pub housed in building dating back to 1533 and originally used as a hospice for monks."
