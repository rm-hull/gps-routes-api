  "description": "A circular walk exploring the countryside and rivers around the small town of Masham in North Yorkshire. The walk includes lovely riverside stretches along the River Burn and the River Ure. You'll also pass close to the Swinton Estate with its deer park and expansive parkland. The route starts in the town centre which includes a nice Market Place and some fine Georgian architecture. You head east from the town to the River Ure, where you pick up a nice riverside footpath. After about half a mile you turn west to pick up a trail along the River Burn. The river passes close to the village of Swinton which includes Swinton Park. The country house is now a hotel set in 200 acres of parkland, lakes and gardens. You can visit the estate, explore the beautiful gardens and watch out for the resident fallow deer. The walk continues past Swinton Moor before picking up a section of the Ripon Rowel long distance trail. You follow the waymarked trail through the countryside to return to the town. To extend your walking around Masham follow footpaths north from the town to the nearby Marfield Wetlands Nature Reserve. The peaceful reserve is home to a variety of species of bird and includes several ponds located next to the River Ure. If you head south you can visit Hackfall Woods and the villages of Grewelthorpe and Kirkby Malzeard. Other walks in the area include the splendid climb to the fascinating Druids Temple. You can follow the Ripon Rowel from the town to the site, where you will find an early 19th century replica of Stonehenge surrounded by attractive woodland. Also near the town is Leighton Reservoir and Roundhill Reservoir. These bodies of water are also located to the west of the town near the Druids Temple.",
