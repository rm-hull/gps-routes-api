A small boat can just be glimpsed, half hidden by vegetation."

In the 1940s the parkland was ploughed in order to provide food during the war years and most trees were felled. In 1993 the arable sections of the park were re-grassed; presently the grounds encompass 15 acres of formal gardens, lakes and woodland. Hoveton Hall and gardens has been owned by members of the Buxton family since 1946."

The layout of the Spider Garden, so called because of its wrought iron entrance gate depicting a spider in its net, has not changed since the 1840s. The gate was made by Eric Stevenson of Wroxham in 1936; he later became known for his wrought iron work in ten English cathedrals. The gate is nicely complemented by a circular spider web, laid out in flint, created in 1998 by landscape gardener James Smith. This walled garden covers an area of one acre."

  "description": "This pretty village is located in the Norfolk Broads, on the other side of the River Bure to its near neighbour of Wroxham. This circular walk takes you to the nearby Hoveton Hall. The route uses a section of the Bure Valley Path and a series of country lanes to explore the area to the north of the village. On the way you will pass the historic hall which is well worth a visit. The regency style house dates back to the early 19th century and is surrounded by beautiful gardens, peaceful woodland and arable land. Highlights include the lovely Magnolia Lake and the rhododendrons in the woodland. During February you can also book for the popular snowdrop walks.",
