The basin has gone through substantial redevelopment, including residential buildings in a mock warehouse style, with the older buildings finding new uses as antique shops, cafes, restaurants and studios."

  "description": "Follow the Exeter Ship Canal from the centre of Exeter to the River Exe Estuary. It's a nice easy cycle or walk following the canal towpath for about 5 miles. The route starts near the cathedral in the city centre and heads south towards Topsham, passing River Exe Country Park and the Exe Reedbeds nature reserve. There's nice views of the River Exe and lots of water loving wildlife to look out for. The route of the canal follows the Exe Valley Ride and the Exe Valley Way so there is scope for extending your exercise along these long distance paths. The Exe Estuary Trail also runs through the area. Our Exeter Circular Walk visits the Riverside Valley Park, the River Exe and the canal too.",

The timber framed slate hung listed building includes a characterful interior with pine strip floors. It's in a fabulous spot overlooking the Exe Estuary with a large garden area to relax in on warmer days. The pub is dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you. Postcode is EX68EE."

      "content": "Follow the Exe Valley way north from the city and you can visit the pretty village of Brampford Speke and the picturesque Bickleigh Mill. It's a fine place for a stroll with a historic mill and shopping area right next to the river. There's also an excellent riverside pub here too. Just a few miles north east of the city there's the wonderful Killerton Park Estate to explore. The National Trust owned park covers thousands of acres with miles of great cycling and walking trails surrounding the 18th century mansion. The historic village of Broadclyst and the peaceful woodland trails around Ashclyst Forest can also be found in this area. For an alternative circular walk around the city see the Exeter Green Circle. This 12 mile trail visits the Alphin Brook Valley, the village of Alphington, the Hoopern Valley, Mincinglake Valley Park and The Ludwell Valley. For more walking ideas in the county see the Devon Walks page."
