  "description": "This interesting walk visits the site of a number of\u00a0Early Neolithic\u00a0chambered long barrows\u00a0and megalithic\u00a0monuments located in the lower valley of the\u00a0River Medway, near Chatham. The circular walk starts from the car park at the Blue Bell Hill picnic site, just to the south of the village. From here you can pick up the Maidstone Centenary Walk and follow it south west towards Eccles. You then turn south towards Hale Farm towards the site of the megaliths. These include Kit's Coty House and Little Kit's Coty House, constructed\u00a0circa\u00a04000 BCE, during the\u00a0Early Neolithic\u00a0period of British prehistory, surviving today in a\u00a0ruined state.  Archaeologists\u00a0have established that the monument was built by\u00a0pastoralist\u00a0communities shortly after the introduction of\u00a0agriculture\u00a0to Britain from continental Europe.\u00a0You'll also pass the Coffin\u00a0Stone, a large\u00a0sarsen\u00a0stone\u00a0located close to the other two monuments. Various archaeologists have argued, that the stone was part of a\u00a0chambered long barrow\u00a0constructed in the\u00a0fourth millennium BCE, during Britain's\u00a0Early Neolithic\u00a0period. It is a rectangular stone lying flat and measuring 4.4 metres (14\u00a0ft) long and 2.8 metres (9.2\u00a0ft) wide. After exploring the stones the walk picks up a section of the North Downs Way to take you back to the car park.",
