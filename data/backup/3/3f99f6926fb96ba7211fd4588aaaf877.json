  "description": "Climb Dunstable Downs and enjoy breathtaking views over the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty on this circular walk in Whipsnade.  There are miles of footpaths crossing the chalk grasslands of the Downs visiting a number of interesting sites including: The Five Knolls - a Bronze Age cemetery constructed over 4000 years ago. Whipsnade Heath - a mosaic of grassland, scrub and woodland, with a fantastic variety of wildlife. A peak of 797 ft (243 m) - this is the highest point in Bedfordshire and provides fine views over the county Whipsnade Tree Cathedral - an extraordinary 10 acre park in planted in the form of a cathedral. The area also includes the Chilterns Gateway Visitor Centre which has a wealth of information about the area, a cafe and fabulous views in a sheltered environment. Look out for gliders, kite fliers, hang gliders and paragliders on the downs too. You will often see them gliding past the hills on a summer day. If you'd like to continue your walk you could follow the Icknield Way Path which runs through the park. This will take you north east into Dunstable or south west to another major highlight of the area at Ivinghoe Beacon . The iconic hill is located just a few miles to the west of the park and is a great way to extend your walking in the area. It commands fine views over the Chiltern Hills and the Vale of Aylesbury.",
