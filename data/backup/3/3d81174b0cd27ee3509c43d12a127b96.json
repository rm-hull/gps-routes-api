  "description": "The town of Merthyr Tydfil is nicely positioned on the edge of the Brecon Beacons and next to the River Taff. There's some good walking trails along the river and up to the series of reservoirs and forests which lie just to the north of the town. This circular walk visits some of the highlights of the area including Cyfarthfa Castle and the River Taff. The walk starts at the Grade I listed Cyfarthfa Castle in the town. The castle is surrounded by attractive gardens, woodland paths, wide lawns and a pretty lake. There's also fine views of the town and the surrounding hills from the castle's elevated position. Follow paths around the lake and you can cross the Taf Fechan and the River Taff to join with the Taff Trail. You can follow the shared cycling and walking path along the river and through the town towards Trefechan. Here you could follow the river north to the Taf Fechan nature reserve where there are opportunities to spot some water loving wildlife. This route crosses the river and follows the waterside path back to the castle grounds.",

      "content": "Follow the Taff Trail north from the town and it will take you to Pentwyn Reservoir and Pontsticill Reservoir where there's a nice circular trail around the water. If you prefer you could also get the splendid Brecon Mountain Railway to Pontsticill station from Pant station, just to the east of the town. Near the reservoir you'll also find the expansive Taf Fechan Forest where there are miles of good trails to try. On the north western fringes of the town you could enjoy a climb to the Cefn Coed Viaduct. It is the third largest viaduct in Wales providing excellent views from the top. Just to the south is Llanwonno where there's some peaceful trails through the St Gwynno Forest. The forest includes a secluded waterfall, a small resevoir and a forestry commission picnic area/car park."
