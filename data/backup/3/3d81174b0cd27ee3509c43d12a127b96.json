  "description": "The town of Merthyr Tydfil is nicely positioned on the edge of the Brecon Beacons and next to the River Taff. There's some good walking trails along the river and up to the series of reservoirs and forests which lie just to the north of the town. This circular walk visits some of the highlights of the area including Cyfarthfa Castle and the River Taff. The walk starts at the Grade I listed Cyfarthfa Castle in the town. The castle is surrounded by attractive gardens, woodland paths, wide lawns and a pretty lake. There's also fine views of the town and the surrounding hills from the castle's elevated position. Follow paths around the lake and you can cross the Taf Fechan and the River Taff to join with the Taff Trail . You can follow the shared cycling and walking path along the river and through the town towards Trefechan. Here you could follow the river north to the Taf Fechan nature reserve where there are opportunities to spot some water loving wildlife. This route crosses the river and follows the waterside path back to the castle grounds.",
