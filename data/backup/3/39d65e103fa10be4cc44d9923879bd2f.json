    "description": "This Nottinghamshire village has some nice riverside trails and peaceful footpaths across the Burton Meadows. This walk takes you east to visit the neighbouring village of Gunthorpe . The walk starts on the southern side of the village where you can pick up a country lane taking you east across Burton Meadows. You then come to Gunthorpe where you can pick up a section of the Trent Valley Way to take you along the river to the pretty Gunthorpe Lock. The route then returns to Burton Joyce following an alternative riverside footpath through Burton Meadows.",
