  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this pretty reservoir on the edge of the Peak District near Sheffield. The walk starts at the village of Low Bradfield and follows a popular footpath around the water with some nice woodland trails to enjoy too. There's great views across the water to the surrounding countryside. The footpath runs for just over 2 miles on fairly flat paths so it's suitable for most abilities. Agden is part of a series of reservoirs in the area. To extend your walk you could head to Damflask Reservoir where there is another nice circular footpath to try. Also nearby are Dale Dike Reservoir and Strines Reservoir .",
