  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Epsom Downs racecourse in Surrey. The downs consist of attractive chalk downland, grassland and woodland. You'll also enjoy wonderful views across the famous racecourse which hosts the Epsom Derby and the Oaks. You can start your walk from the Tattenham Corner car park at the northern end of the downs. Tattenham Corner train station is also very close to the start of the walk so you can easily visit by public transport. The footpath then passes through the course, heading across Walton Downs towards Walton on the Hill. The route then skirts the edge of Banstead Heath before returning to the car park via Tadworth Farm. The area is great for wildlife spotting. Look out for Skylarks and various butterflies including the rare Chalk Hill Blue. The walk can be extended by further exploring Banstead Heath which is criss crossed with miles of footpaths. There's lots of good options if you'd like to extend your walking in the area. A couple of miles to the north west you'll find Epsom Common and Ashtead Common National Nature Reserve. Both of these large open spaces have nice walking trails to follow. The Thames Down Link passes through Ashtead Park just to the west of the downs. National Cycle Network Route 22 crosses part of the downs so you can bring your bike too. You can explore large sections of the racecourse using the google street view link below.",
