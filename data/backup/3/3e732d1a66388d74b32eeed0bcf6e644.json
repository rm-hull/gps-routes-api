  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Eliburn Reservoir in Livingston, West Lothian. The reservoir is located in Eliburn park just west of Livingston centre. There's some nice trails in the park running around the small lake into Livingston Old Wood. Look out for water loving birds on the lake and woodland birds in the wooded areas. The 3 acre lake is also a popular fishing spot with species including Tench, Bream, Roach, Perch, Ide, Hybrid, Barbel and Rudd available.",

      "content": "Head south into the Pentland Hills and you could continue your waterside walking around Cobbinshaw Reservoir. Almondell and Calderwood Country Park is located just a few miles to the east of the reservoir. There's miles of trails through attractive woodland and parkland with views of the River Almond too. To the south east there's Harperrig Reservoir. Here you'll find some interesting wildlife including various wildfowl and the Eurasian otter. The site also includes views of the Water of Leith and the 15th century Cairns Castle ruins. At the eastern end of the lake you can pick up the long distance Cross Borders Drove Road. It runs south through the Pentland Hills to West Linton, Peebles, Traquair and then on to Hawick via the Yarrow Valley. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pentland Hills Walks page."
