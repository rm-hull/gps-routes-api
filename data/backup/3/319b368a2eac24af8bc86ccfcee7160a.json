  "description": "A super cycling and walking route along a dismantled railway line from Forres in Moray to Grantown On Spey, Highland. The route passes through a pleasant mixture of farmland, woodland and moorland while also crossing the River Divie at Glenernie. It provides a link between the Speyside Way in the south and the Moray Firth Trail to the north. Views from the trail include Nairn, Inverness, Moray, Ross & Cromarty, the Cromdale Hills and the Cairngorm Mountains. For cyclists a mountain bike or hybrid is advised.",

      "content": "Forres is also the start point for the Moray Coast Trail. You could pick up the trail here and follow it north to the lovely Findhorn Bay where there are excellent bird watching opportunites. Just south of Forres you'll pass the Darnaway Forest where you could take a small detour to visit Logie Steading and the Findhorn River. The estate includes some fine riverside walks, a garden centre, a cafe and some splendid waterfalls at the photogenic Randolph's Leap. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
