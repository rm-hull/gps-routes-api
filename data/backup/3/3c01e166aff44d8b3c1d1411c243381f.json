  "description": "The Kent based village of East Peckham is located on two rivers in a lovely countryside spot a few miles east of Tonbridge. This circular walk from the village visits the River Medway and the River Bourne both of which run through the area. Start the walk on the eastern side of the town where you can pick up a footpath heading south to the river, passing Branbridges. Here you pick up the Medway Valley Walk and follow the waymarked trail west along the towpath. You will pass Oak Weir Lock before coming to Ford Green Bridge. Here you cross the river and head north along a section of the Wealdway and the Greensand Way. It will take you through Barnes Street to Pierce Mill where there are views of the River Bourne. You can then follow Pierce Mill Lane and Hatches Lane east to return to East Peckham.",

The pub has some history too, being set in a Grade II listed traditional Coaching Inn dating back to 1588. Indoors there's quirky low ceilings and a cosy wood burner for the colder months. You can find them at 226 Tonbridge Road, Little Mill with a postcode of TN12 5LA for your sat navs."

Both of these routes use a section of the Medway Valley Walk to create a circular walk around the area. Near Wateringbury you can also visit the lovely Teston Bridge Country Park where you'll find a medieval 14th century bridge, a rushing weir, river trails and lots of river loving wildlife.
