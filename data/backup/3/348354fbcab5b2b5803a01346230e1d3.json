This image shows the Motte (to the left) and the massive earthworks surrounding the Bailey which lies to the north of the Motte. The castle was probably built on the site of an Anglian Moot in the 11th century by Robert de Umfraville (one of the members of a noble family involved in the Norman conquest, possibly a cousin of William the Conqueror). Subsequently the family seat was moved to the more accessible Harbottle Castle."
