  "description": "This country park includes 500 acres of lakes and parkland, housing various sculptures as well as being the home of several endangered species. The fascinating Yorkshire Sculpture Park also sits within the park and is well worth exploring. The only one of its kind, the park is an international centre for modern and contemporary art, which receives thousands of visitors each year. Also of interest is the Grade II listed Bretton Hall built around 1720. The Barnsley Boundary Walk and Dearne Way run through the park so you could continue your walk along the River Dearne towards Barnsley. Just to the north of the park you will find Coxley Woods. There's miles of shady footpaths here, with a series of ponds, streams and becks.",

      "content": "Just to the south there's Cannon Hall Country Park to explore. Here you'll find a fine old hall surrounded by beautiful parkland and gardens, a lake and a waterfall. The peaceful woodland trails in Deffer Wood can also be picked up in this area. To the west you can pick up the Emley Circular Trail near the village of Emley. The 6 mile trail explores the area around the pretty village with some fine views of the Upper Dearne Valley."
