  "description": "This Cumbrian village is located in the Eden district of the county. The pretty village includes an ancient church in a scenic location next to the Dalebanks Beck which runs through the area. This circular walk from the settlement climbs to Crosby Ravensworth Fell where there is an extensive area of limestone pavement and some tremendous views over the area. On the way you will also visit a number of old quarries and the neighbouring village of Oddendale which lies just to the west. On the fell you can also link up with the epic Wainwright's Coast to Coast Walk. This popular trail runs from St Bees Head to Robin Hood's Bay, passing through some of the most dramatic landscapes in the country. To continue your walking in the area visit the historic Shap Abbey or enjoy easy waterside walking on the Appleby Riverside Walk. The circular path around the scenic Wet Sleddale Reservoir lies just to the south west.",
