  "description": "The Dartmoor village of Shaugh Prior is in a nice position for exploring some of the highlights of the national park on foot. There's also some good long distance walking trails to pick up close to the village. This circular walk takes you to the nearby Dewerstone Rocks where there are nice woodland trails and riverside paths along the River Meavy to enjoy. From the village you can follow public footpaths north west to Dewerstone Wood and then up to Dewerstone Rock. The impressive rock formations are very photogenic and are a popular spot for rock climbers. From the rocks you head north to Dewerstone Cottage. Head west from here and you will soon reach the River Meavy. There's nice trails here heading south along the river where you can also see evidence of an old tramway which once ran through the area. After passing along the river the route then returns to south east to Shaugh Prior. To extend your walk you can try our longer circular walk to Cadover Bridge and Dewerstone Rocks which heads north east from Dewerstone. There's more nice riverside paths along the River Plym and attractive woodland to see here. The long distance West Devon Way can also be picked up to the west of the village. You can follow the waymarked trail south to visit Plymbridge Woods and Cann Woods. To the north of the village there are nice waterside trails along Burrator Reservoir and the Devonport Leat .",
