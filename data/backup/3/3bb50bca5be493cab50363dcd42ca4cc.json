  "description": "Enjoy a series of walking paths around this Iron Age Hillfort near Sevenoaks. The circular walk will take you through ancient woodland with interesting plants including heather and bilberry. From the high points there are great views of the surrounding countryside. Dating from 100 BC the impressive fort is one of the largest in the country, situated in an excellent defensive position on a very steep hill. You can start your exercise from the good sized car park off Styants Bottom Road. From here you can pick up a number of trails to take you up to the hill fort which stands at a height of over 600ft. There are also bridleways which are popular with mountain bikers. To extend your walk you can follow paths south across Raspit Hill and Ightham Common to the splendid Ightham Mote. Here you will find a medieval moated manor house surrounded by gardens, parkland and woodland. You can also pick up the Greensand Way and follow it to the nearby Knole Park where there's more great walks to try around the deer park. Mountain bikers can head to the nearby Mereworth Woods where there are miles of trails with some good descents and jumps to try.",

      "content": "The pretty village of Shipbourne is located a few miles south of the hill. There's a nice commonside pub here, an interesting old church and lots of pretty cottages. To the north west there's the nearby village of Kemsing where you can explore the Kemsing Downs Nature Reserve. It's a lovely place for a walk with ancient woodland, bluebells, wildlife and more tremendous views from its elevated location. Near here there's Otford where you can visit the splendid Otford Mount viewpoint and the ruins of the 15th century Otford Palace. For more walking ideas in the area see the Kent Walks page."
