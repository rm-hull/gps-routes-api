  "description": "This town in South Norfolk has some pleasant river trails through the Waveney Valley and an attractive town centre with several Georgian buildings to admire. This circular walk from the town uses sections of the Angles Way to visit the neighbouring settlements of Mendham and Weybread. Along the way there's some pleasant countryside and views of the River Waveney which winds its way through the area. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the Angles Way and follow the waymarked footpath east through the countryside to Mendham in Suffolk. Here you turn south west to follow public footpaths along the River Waveney through Mendham Marshes. You continue west towards Weybread before turning north towards the lakes at Shotford Heath. Shortly after you cross the river and return to the town centre.",
