  "description": "This Lancashire based town has some nice canalside trails and a nature trail in nearby Woodnook. It's also close to the Ribble Valley and the West Pennine Moors where many of the walking highlights of the area can be found. This walk from the town takes you along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to the neighbouring town of Blackburn. The walk starts at the train station and heads west towards Oswaldtwistle and Cote Holme. The route then picks up the canal towpath and follows it through Rishton where you will pass the Rishton Reservoir. You continue west through Whitebirk before coming into Blackburn and finishing at the cathedral in the town centre.",
