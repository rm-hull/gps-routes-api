It stretches from Preston Brook, near Runcorn to Derwent Mouth near Shardlow."

The canal was fully opened in 1777 between Derwent Mouth and Preston Brook. This allowed connection with no fewer than nine other canals or significant branches.

Boats up to ten feet in width can use the canal from Stenson to the River Trent at Derwent Mouth, though whether two of these actually manage to pass each other without someone scraping the bottom or becoming grounded, I wonder."

  "description": "Follow the Trent and Mersey Canal through Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire on this long distance waterside walk. The route starts at Shardlow near Long Eaton in Derbyshire and heads through Weston-on-Trent and Willington to Burton Upon Trent where you will pass Mercia Marina and the lovely Branston Water Park with its woodland, wetland and meadow. You continue to Alrewas where you will pass the National Memorial Arboretum. The Arboretum contains over 50,000 trees with nearly 300 memorials for the armed forces, civilian organisations and voluntary bodies who have played a part in serving the country. The next stage takes you through Handsacre to Rugeley where you will pass the wonderful Cannock Chase Country Park. It's worth taking a short detour to explore the Cannock Chase AONB with miles of woodland walking and cycling trails, lakes, ponds and wildlife including deer and various birds to look out for. You continue through the beautiful Trent Valley passing the National Trust Owned Shugborough Park at Great Haywood. It is worth a visit with a grand hall, museum, kitchen garden, model farm and extensive parkland with follies, woodland and a Chinese House with two Chinese-style bridges. The route continues through Weston to Stone before coming to the outskirts of Stoke-on-Trent where you will pass the splendid Trentham Gardens. Also in Stoke you will pass Westport Lake which is worth a small detour. You continue north to Kidsgrove where you will find the  Grade II* listed Rode Hall, surrounded by parkland and formal gardens. The hall and gardens are open to the public from April to September and are well worth a small detour from the canal. The canal continues through Cheshire to Sandbach where you will pass close to the Watch Lane Flash Nature Reserve. Onward to Middlewhich and Northwhich where you will pass Marbury Country Park. It's a delightful area with  magnificent Lime avenues, an Arboretum and the delightful Budworth Mere in Great Budworth. Near here there's the wonderful Anderton Boat Lift, a marvel of engineering and one of the highlights of the waterways of Britain. The final section takes you to Runcorn passing Barnton and Weaverham with views of the River Weaver. You finish near Runcorn where the Trent and Mersey Canal links with the Bridgewater Canal. You can walk along the towpath for the whole route while cyclists can enjoy a long section through Stoke-on-Trent and a shorter section between Weston-on-Trent and Swarkstone.",
