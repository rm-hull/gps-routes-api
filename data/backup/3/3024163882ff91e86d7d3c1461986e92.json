    "description": "This 25 mile range of hills are located just to the north east of Stirling. The scenic rolling hills are a fine place for walkers with many excellent viewpoints, beautiful glens, waterfalls, streams and lakes to enjoy. This circular walk in the hills starts off from the Ochil Hills Woodland Park before taking you up to the viewpoints at Wood Hill, Ben Ever and The Nebit. You'll also visit Silver Glen and the beautiful waterfalls at Alva Glen . You start off from the car park in the Ochil Hills Woodland Park which lies just to the east of the town of Alva. The park was planted as part of the Alva House estate and is believed to be one of the oldest plantations in Scotland. It includes bluebell woods, the old silver mines and wildlife including roe deer, woodpeckers and buzzards. From here you can pick up woodland trails through the park before climbing northeast towards Wood Hill which stands at a height of 525 metres. You then head north east along the ridge between Wood Hill and Ben Ever which is 622 metres high. There are fine views over the Glen of Glenwinnel Burn to the surrounding hills from here. The route then heads south towards The Nebit at 449 metres high, commanding more fine views over the Forth Valley below. You then descend through Silver Glen which takes its name from the silver that was mined there in the early 18th century. Near here you will pass Alva Glen as well. The delightful glen is one of the walking highlights of the area with a pretty stream and waterfalls to admire. From here you follow country lanes through the town before returning to the woodland park. To continue your walking in the hills visit the picturesque reservoirs at Glendevon and the beautiful Dollar Glen .",
