The estate is now run as a mindfulness retreat but is open to the public on certain days."

A most attractive and unspoilt village, it has become a popular destination for yachtsmen, tourists and a sought after place to live, which is reflected its relatively high property prices. The village is believed to be named after 'Deedas', a Saxon chief, who probably settled here soon after the Saxon invasion of Devon in about 660 A.D. The village hosts an interesting and pleasing variety of building styles (and colours); this view is towards the ferry that crosses the River Dart."

  "description": "This beautiful trail takes you along the River Dart from Totnes to Dartmouth . The trail passes through the villages of Ashprington, Cornworthy and Dittisham before finishing at Dartmouth Harbour. Highlights near the route include the splendid National Trust owned Greenway Estate . Formerly owned by Agatha Christie it boasts an 18th century Georgian house and lovely riverside gardens. This is a fairly easy walk with very few climbs and links with the South West Coast Path. The northern end of the trail  links with the circular Totnes River Walk which follows the Franklin Totnes Trail along a different part of the river.",
