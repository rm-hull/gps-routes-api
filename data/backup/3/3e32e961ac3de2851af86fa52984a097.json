  "description": "This small coastal town is located in a lovely spot on the Llyn Peninsula. It's great for walkers with a pretty harbour, miles of cliff top coastal paths and beautiful beaches to explore. This walk from the town takes you along the Llyn Coastal Path to visit the beautiful Porthdinllaen. The walk starts in the town centre and picks up the Llyn Coastal Path to head west along the beach towards Penrhyn Nefyn. You continue along the Morfa Nefyn and Porthdinllaen beach before coming to the headland. You can follow a footpath up to the lifeboat station in this scenic National Trust run area. On the coastal stretch look out for several species of sea birds including oystercatchers, sand martins and cormorants. Grey seals can also be spotted here. After exploring the headland you head through Morfa Nefyn before returning along the cost to the town.",

You can find them on St Davids Road at postcode LL53 6EA. On the route at Porthdinllaen you could stop off at the T\u0177 Coch Inn. The excellent pub is one of the best in Wales and was named in the top ten beach bars in the world in a recent survey. It's located next to the beach where you can sit outside and look out for seals in the water. There's also wonderful views over the Irish Sea to The Rivals here. You can find the inn at postcode LL53 6DB for your sat navs."

Head north along the coast path and you could visit climb to the wonderful hill fort at Trer Ceiri and the substantial peak of Yr Eifl. The unusual landscape at the Trefor Quarry can also be visited near here. There's wonderful views back to the coast and some fascinating history to be found in this area. If you head a few miles to the south you'll come to the southern side of the peninsula where you can visit the coastal settlements of Pwllheli, Llanbedrog and Abersoch. The Garn Boduan Walk starts from the village. It will take you up to the viewpoint and Iron Age Hill fort located just south of the settlement. A few miles to the south there's the inland climb to the remote Garn Fadryn. There's an Iron Age Hillfort and some incredible views from the top of this peaceful hill. For more walking ideas in the area see the Llyn Peninsula Walks page."
