The car park in Thrunton Wood offers a delightful picnic area, an information point (unmanned) and the starting point for three colour coded waymarked walks."

  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this large area of woodland near Alnwick. The forest has two waymarked walking trails. One is an easy trail of 2 miles and the other is a more challenging 5 mile walk involving some climbing. The area is also popular with mountain bikers as there are a number of very good off road trails to try. On the trails you can climb Thrunton Crag and enjoy wonderful views towards the Cheviots. A few miles to the south of the woods you will find the splendid Cragside Country Park. Here you will find peaceful woodland trails, Nelly Moss Lakes and two waterfalls. Also nearby is the delightful Hulne Park. The extensive park has several waymarked trails with woodland, riverside paths and wonderful views from the high points.",

This starts from the nearby unspoilt village which is located in a picturesque spot on the River Aln. Just to the north west is the wonderful Ingram Valley where you can enjoy riverside trails and visit the splendid Linhope Spout waterfall. To the west there's the circular Shepherds Cairn Walk which visits a memorial to two shepherds who lost their lives in the exceptionally cold winter of 1962. The walk starts from Alnham where there's a noteworthy Grade I listed 12th century church."
