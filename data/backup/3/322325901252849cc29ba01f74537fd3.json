From the castle there are fabulous views towards the Bristol channel, the Quantock hills and Exmoor. The West Somerset Coast Path passes through the area. This waymarked trail offers a good way of exploring the area further. You can pick it up at Dunster Beach just to the east of the castle and follow it north into Minehead. The climbs to Dunkery Beacon and the Brendon Hills are also not too far away. There's great views over the area from these viewpoints.",
