  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Sheepstor where you can enjoy lovely views down to Burrator Reservoir. The walk runs for about 3 miles with a moderate climb and then some flat waterside paths along the reservoir. Start the walk from the reservoir car park at the eastern end of the water. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south west to Yellowmead Down and Sheepstor. The summit is 369m above sea level and it is one of the area's most prominent tors. There's nice views across Dartmoor and the reservoir below from here. The route then descends to the west, passing through woodland before coming to Burrator Reservoir. You can then pick up paths along the water, leading you back to the car park and the finish point of the walk. At the southern end of the route you can take a short detour to visit Sheepstor village, after which the hill is named. The village has a noteworthy church, dedicated to St Leonard, which is built of granite and dates from the 15th century. To continue your walking in the area, try the circular walk around the reservoir. There's nice woodland trails, brooks, streams and waterfalls to see here. Also nearby are the nice woodland trails in Plymbridge Woods .",

      "content": "For some post walk refreshments head south west of Burrator reservoir where you'll find the noteworthy Royal Oak in Meavy. The pub has fine credentials having been voted the 2019 Country Pub of the Year by Plymouth CAMRA. It's located in a delightful spot, next to Meavy Church and the pretty village green. There's a splendid outdoor seating area with a wide lawn where you can sit and enjoy a drink on fine days. The pub also has an interesting history having been a former 15th century Church house inn. It takes its name from the oak tree on the village green which is some 800 years old. This is one of the few remaining traditional Dartmoor inns with a flagstone floor, oak beams and a large open fireplace. Some of the seats are pews from adjacent church. You can find the pub less than half a mile south of the reservoir dam with a postcode of PL20 6PJ for your sat navs.  Pictured above, the Royal Oak pub and Meavy village green. A lovely place to relax after your walk on a summer day."
