  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Sheepstor where you can enjoy lovely views down to Burrator Reservoir . The walk runs for about 3 miles with a moderate climb and then some flat waterside paths along the reservoir. Start the walk from the reservoir car park at the eastern end of the water. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south west to Yellowmead Down and Sheepstor. The summit is 369m above sea level and it is one of the area's most prominent tors. There's nice views across Dartmoor and the reservoir below from here. The route then descends to the west, passing through woodland before coming to Burrator Reservoir. You can then pick up paths along the water, leading you back to the car park and the finish point of the walk. At the southern end of the route you can take a short detour to visit Sheepstor village, after which the hill is named. The village has a noteworthy church, dedicated to St Leonard, which is built of granite and dates from the 15th century. To continue your walking in the area, try the circular walk around the reservoir. There's nice woodland trails, brooks, streams and waterfalls to see here. Also nearby are the nice woodland trails in Plymbridge Woods .",
