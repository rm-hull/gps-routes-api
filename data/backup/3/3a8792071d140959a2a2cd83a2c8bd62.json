  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside walk along the shore of this large lake on Bodmin Moor. At over 900 acres it is the largest lake in Cornwall. The walk starts at the parking area at the western end of the lake and follows a waterside trail along the shore to the dam and valve tower at the southern end. The area is a nature reserve so look out for a wide variety of birdlife on the water and Bodmin ponies around the water. You can extend your walking in the area by visiting the mysterious Dozmary Pool. The walk starts from the parking area at the south of the lake and follows a country lane with great views back to Colliford Lake. You could also head a few miles north and climb to Brown Willy, Rough Tor - the two highest points on the moor.",
