This is an unusual tree; it doesn't look like most old pollards, but I don't know how it came to be this way."

It was built in 1543 for King Henry VIII and now provides an insight into the Tudor history of the forest. It's well worth exploring with the additonal bonus of some lovely views over the forest from the top floor of the building. You can find it next to the Chingford Visitor centre at a postcode of E4 7QH. The circular Theydon Bois Oak Trail can be picked up on the eastern side of the forest at Theydon Bois underground station. The challenging trail visits Ambresbury Banks Iron Age Fort and a Deer Sanctuary near the village. The rhododendron, oak and ash woodland of Knighton Wood can be found in the Buckhurst Hill area of the forest. The River Roding Walk can also be picked up in this area. The Three Forests Way runs through the forest. This long distance trail will take you to Hatfield Forest and Hainault Forest. The circular walk from Loughton explores the area from the nearby town's London Underground station. It's an attractive place worthy of exploration with dozens of historic listed buildings and three conservation areas. The route also visits the Roding Valley Meadows nature reserve on the River Roding. The Green Link Walk links with the route on its western fringes at Upper Walthamstow."
