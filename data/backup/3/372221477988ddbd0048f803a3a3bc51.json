  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk around this country park and nature reserve in Weymouth. The park has a host of facilities with a cafe, outdoor gym, go karts, model railway, circular tree trail and pitch and putt golf course. The adjacent nature reserve has an easy access walking path taking you through various habitats including reedbed, open water, saltmarsh and wet grassland. The reserve attracts a wide variety of birdlife with Cetti's warbler and Little Egrets common visitors. A cycle path runs through part of the park and the south side of the nature reserve. Just a mile to the west there's another fine nature reserve at the RSPB's Radipole Lake. There's views of the River Wey, pleasant lakeside trails and the opportunity to pick up the Rodwell Trail here.",
