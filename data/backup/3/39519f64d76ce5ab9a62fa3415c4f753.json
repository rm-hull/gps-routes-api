  "description": "Enjoy and easy cycle or walk around this pretty lake in Milton Keynes. A lovely waterside path runs around the perimeter of the lake so it's perfect for families. There's a free trim trail with outdoor gym equipment and a table tennis table. There is also an excellent pub called the Caldecotte Arms where you can pick up a bite to eat. Walton Park and lake are right next to Caldecotte Lake so you can easily extend your outing there. The site includes two bird hides where you can look out for a variety of birds on the water. Waterfowl, dragonflies and damselflies are regular visitors to the lake. Caldecotte is located on the Grand Union Canal - you could pick this up and head a couple of miles north to the super Willen Lake where you will find more waterside walking and cycling.",

      "content": "Just a couple of miles east of the lake you'll find the expansive Aspley Woods and the adjacent Bow Brickhill Woods. There's 800 acres to explore with mountain bike trails and miles of footpaths. You can also pick up the Milton Keynes Boundary Walk in the woods. This long distance circular route explores the countryside, woods and villages surrounding the town. You could follow the waymarked trail north to Woburn Sands or head south to Rushmere Country Park. The Greensand Ridge Walk also passes through the woods. If you follow it east you will soon come to the splendid Woburn Park where there's a historic abbey and a deer park. To the west there's another nice circular lakeside trail around Furzton Lake. Just to the north west there's the canalside village of Cosgrove. There's a fine 17th century pub and the notweworthy Cosgrove aqueduct here. The cast iron trough structure carries the Grand Union Canal over the River Great Ouse, just to the south east of the village.  On the eastern side of Milton Keynes there's Newport Pagnell to explore. There's some lovely riverside trails, a fine local park and several historic buildings to see in this nearby town. The town is well known for being the original home of the exclusive sports car manufacturer Aston Martin. There's also a Grade I listed iron bridge dating from the early 19th century to see here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Buckinghamshire Walks page."
