The glen includes some beautiful scenery with a pretty stream, an old arched footbridge, spectacular mountain views and some splendid flora and fauna to see. The glen is also close to the stunning Glenveagh National Park where you could pick up the Glenveagh Bridle Path. The shared cycling and walking path will take you through the glen to the historic Glenveagh Castle where you can explore the beautiful gardens and learn about the castle's fascinating history. There's more nice waterside paths along the nearby Lough Salt. You can also climb to Loughsalt mountain for some fine views over the lake and surrounding area."
