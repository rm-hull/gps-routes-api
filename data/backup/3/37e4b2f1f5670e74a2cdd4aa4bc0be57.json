  "description": "Enjoy a short circular walk or cycle along the network of way-marked paths in this pretty country park in the Wakefield area of Yorkshire. The park features open grassland, woodland and ponds. Look out for wildlife including Water vole, Skylarks and Buzzards. The park is located right next to Fitzwilliam rail station about 7 miles south east of Wakefield. To extend your outing you could head about a mile south and visit the delightful Hemsworth Water Park . Here you can enjoy a short stroll around the two large lakes which are surrounded by parkland and woodland. Just to the north is the wonderful Nostell Priory with 300 acres of parkland and gardens to explore. A short distance to the west you'll find Wintersett Reservoir and Anglers Country Park . There's nice lakeside walking trails to be found here.",
