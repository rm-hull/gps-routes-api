  "description": "Explore 170 acres of open grasslands, meadows, woodlands and lakes in this fine country park in Huntingdon. There are a number of pleasant woodland and lakeside paths to enjoy. There is also a bridleway/cycle path running through the park while National Cycle Route 51 runs past the perimeter. For mountain bikers there is a specially designed course with mounds of various sizes. The park has excellent facilities with a visitor centre and cafe. The Ouse Valley Way long distance trail runs past the park so it's easy to extend your walking in the area. You could follow the path east through Godmanchester and visit the delightful Houghton Mill. The working 18th-century watermill is set in an idyllic location on an island in the river.",
