The sculpture is a tribute to Sophie Booth, landlady and lover to J.M.William Turner. The sculpture stands at 12 feet tall and is composed of bronze. The sculpture is known as \u201cThe Shell Lady,\u201d because it takes inspiration from the shell lady souvenirs sold at gift shops across Margate. The site of the Turner Contemporary Art Gallery was once the location of the famous guesthouse in which Turner stayed."

  "description": "This town is located on the north Kent coast near Herne Bay and Ramsgate. It's a popular place to visit with a train station, some pleasant gardens and a sandy beach which can get very busy in the summer months. This walk in the town takes you along a section of the Thanet Coastal Path to Westbrook. On the way you'll pass some of the local landmarks including the wide sandy beaches, the contemporary Turner gallery and the old sea front amusements. The starting point is the car park next to the Winter Gardens at the eastern end of the town. From here you head west passing the pier, The Turner Gallery, the Harbour, Dreamland Amusement park and Westbrook Bay before finishing at the Sunken Garden at Westbrook.",
