  "description": "This walk takes you along a section of the Findhorn River in Darnaway Forest near Forres, Moray. You'll pass through the beautiful Findhorn Gorge where you can enjoy peaceful woodland trails and fine views. The route also runs past the Logie Steading estate where you can visit the garden centre and cafe. At the southern end you will reach Randolph's Leap, a photogenic spot with dramatic rocks, cliffs and waterfalls. You can start the walk from the car park near the Mains of Sluie, just off the A940. From here you can pick up the Sluie Walk and follow it west to the riverside. Follow the paths south and they will take you past the Logie Estate to the Bridge of Logie. Just south of here you will come to Randolph's Leap, a real highlight on the river. On the opposite side of the river there's a nice circular trail to try from the Dun Earn car park.",

      "content": "Head north into Forres and you could pick up the long distance Moray Coast Trail and follow it north to the beautiful Findorn Bay. Just east of the woods you can link up with the Dava Way. For more woodland walking and cycling trails head north to visit the expansive Culbin Forest in Nairn. The area includes the Culbin Sands Nature Reserve where you can look out for a variety of coastal birds. To the west there's some interesting local history at Cawdor Castle and Woods. The 15th century castle is surrounded by beautiful grounds and gardens with more trails through the adjacent Cawdor Woods. Just to the north there's also the historic Brodie Castle. The 16th century castle is run by the National Trust for Scotland and includes some lovely grounds with 400 varieties of daffodil, sculptures, gardens and a wildlife rich lake."
