  "description": "This area of natural beauty in Louth is a lovely place for an afternoon stroll. You can follow the waymarked Silver Lincs Way long distance trail from the centre of the town to the park. It's only about half a mile away, following roads south west out of the town and through Westgate Fields. At the park you'll find delightful woodland trails along the River Ludd which meanders through the park. It's a great place for a picnic but there's also a nice cafe on site if you prefer. To extend your walk you can continue along the Silver Lincs Way. Following it west and then north takes you through the Lincolnshire Wolds to the woodland of Welton Vale and on to North Elkington. It continues all the way to Grimsby. On the eastern side of Louth you can pick up the Louth Canal and follow the towpath to Tetney Marshes on the Lincolnshire coast.",

Here you'll find a 12th century church, a fine 18th century pub and nice views of the River Bain. The area also includes Goulceby and the unique landscape of the splendid Red Hill Nature Reserve. There's a steep chalk escarpment with wonderful views and some rare plants and flowers to see here. Near here there's also Biscathorpe, Binbrook and East Wykeham where there are the sites of two deserted medieval villages to explore. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lincolnshire Walks page."
