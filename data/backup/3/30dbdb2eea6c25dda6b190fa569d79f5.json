  "description": "Enjoy a gentle stroll around Petersfield Lake and heath on this easy walk in Hampshire. The heath has a free car park off the B2146 less than a mile from the town centre. From here you can pick up a nice trail around the 22 acre pond where you will see many ducks and swans. There's also footpaths branching off across the heath with areas of grassland and bronze age burial mounds to look out for. The park has good facilities with a play area, cafe and boat hire. The long distance Serpent Trail starts on the heath so it's a great option if you would like to extend your walk. You can follow the trail east and enjoy views of the River Rother at Durleighmarsh. The Hangers Way also passes close to the heath. It heads north through the town to Shoulder of Mutton Hill, Noar Hill and the pretty Selborne Common. Heading south will take you through Buriton to the splendid Queen Elizabeth Country Park where you climb Butser Hill for wonderful views over the area.",
