  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll along the Oxford Canal and the River Cherwell in this country park in Banbury. In the park you will find wildlife, wild flower meadows, community woodland and several areas of native trees and shrubs. The park is conviniently located in the centre of the town, near to the rail station and bus station. It's easy to extend your walk by continuing along the canal towpath. You could also try our Banbury Circular Walk to explore the countryside surrounding the town. It makes use of the Jurassic Way, Macmillan Way and Oxford Canal Walk long distance footpaths to take you on a tour of the pretty villages surrounding the town.",

      "content": "Just to the north there's a nice circular path around Grimsbury Reservoir. The area also includes the Grimsbury Woodland nature reserve where there's some nice woodland trails and wildlife to see. Head west of the park and you will soon come to the little village of Wroxton where you can visit the splendid Wroxton Abbey. This 17th century Jacobean mansion is surrounded by beautiful grounds and public footpaths. On the walk there's also a visit to Drayton where there's a fine village pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Oxfordshire Walks page."
