The carding mill itself dates from the 18th century and is named after the first stage in making cloth. The three stages being carding, spinning and weaving. The carding mill was closed and later demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, though the adjacent factory building can still be seen in the valley today. The mill building itself has been converted into flats and a number of other private houses exist near it and the visitor centre, forming a small settlement in the valley."

    "description": "Visit a lovely reservoir and waterfall on this short walk in the Shropshire Hills AONB. The walk starts at the National Trust's Carding Mill Valley visitor centre and car park in Church Stretton . You begin by following a pretty stream uphill on a good stony path before bearing left on New Pool Hollow to visit the pretty reservoir. You'll pass mill pools and the 2500 year old Bodbury Ring hill fort on the way. The walk then continues uphill to Lightspot Hollow where you will find a waterfall in a beautiful V-shaped valley lined with bilberry, bracken and heather. You can look out for trout in the pools and stonechats, buzzards and red kites in the air. If you'd like to continue your walk you could head to the high point of the Long Mynd at Pole Bank. You could also climb the nearby Caer Caradoc for more fabulous views. The Shropshire Way and the Jack Mytton Way also pass through the area so you could pick these up easily too.",
