  "description": "The Derbyshire Dales town of Ashbourne is a fantastic base for walkers looking to explore the southern end of the Peak District. Several long distance walking trails pass through the town and surrounding area. The beautiful valleys of the River Dove and River Manifold are also nearby. This walk takes you along the Bonnie Prince Charlie Walk to the delightful village of Osmaston and the adjacent Osmaston Park. Here you'll find pretty lakes and nice woodland trails through Shirley Park. The route loops through the park, crossing the lake and following the wooded paths before returning to Ashbourne on the same path. You can extend the walk by continuing south along the Bonnie Prince Charlie Walk to Shirley and Longford. Just after passing Shirley the Centenary Way long distance trail branches off to the east. You could follow it through the countryside to Ednaston and Brailsford. The Tissington Trail, a shared walkng and cycling path runs north from the town. You can follow this into the Peak District and visit the beautiful Dovedale and and Ilam Park .",

      "content": "To continue your walking from the town try the Ashbourne to Dovedale Circular Walk which visits the glorious Dovedale before climbing to a wonderful viewpoint at Thorpe Cloud. The circular Fenny Bentley Walk also visits Thorpe Cloud and Dovedale from the pretty village to the south east. The village is worthy of exploration with the pretty Bentley Brook, a 14th century church and a fine inn with particularly lovely gardens to see. The route also visits the 17th-century Jacobean mansion house at Tissington Hall. The delightful village of Parwich lies just a few miles to the east of Dovedale. There's a pretty village green, old limestone cottages and a pub dating back to the 1600s. You can reach the village on the Limestone Way from Thorpe."
