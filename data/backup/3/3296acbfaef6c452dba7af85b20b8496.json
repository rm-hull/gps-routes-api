  "description": "This popular country park is located in Trehafod near Pontypridd . It's a great place for mountain bike rides with bike hire and a number of good off road trails. The MTB trails have a great mix for intermediate and advanced riders.  The video below will give you a good idea of the downhill trails you can expect to see at the site. Walkers can also enjoy a network of woodland paths with picturesque waterfalls, streams, ponds and a picnic site. You can start off at the car park at the northern end of the site, just east of Trehafod centre and train station. Trails will then take you south towards Mynydd Gelliwion. At the nothern end of the park there are also some nice trails along the River Rhonnda.",
