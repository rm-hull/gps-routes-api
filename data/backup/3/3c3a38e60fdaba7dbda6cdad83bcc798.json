Then, according to the chronicler William of Malmesbury, he directed that he should be carried into the nearby church, where he breathed his last. The church 1358153 celebrated its 1300th Anniversary in May, 2009. The spring, at the foot of the ridge on which church and village are built, has a reputation as one of our most authentic holy wells. It is the source of the River Sheppey; in charters of Aldhelm's day the Sheppey was called Doulting Stream."

  "description": "Visit the Charlton viaduct and the village of Doulting on this circular walk in the Somerset town of Shepton Mallet. Just to the north of the town you can pick up the East Mendip Way on Barren Down. Then follow the path east to the Charlton Viaduct. This section passes close to Kilver Court where there are some splendid gardens with hostas, day lilies and candelabra primula next to the River Sheppey. From the viaduct the route climbs towards Ingsdons Hill which reaches a height of over 700ft. You then descend to Chelynch passing Pitts Wood on the way. From here you turn south to the little village of Doulting. The spring in Doulton is the source of the River Sheppey and named after St Aldhelm who died in the village in 709. The village also includes a tithe barn which dates from the 15th century. The final section of the walk follows a public footpath along the River Sheppey, returning you to the viaduct. To extend your walk you could continue east along the East Mendip Way towards Downhead, Cranmore Tower and Asham Wood. Heading west will take you towards Croscombe.",
