  "description": "This Lancashire based village has some nice waterside trails along the local river and canal. There's also an access point to a major country park on the outskirts of the settlement. This walk takes you north from the village along the River Loctock to the lovely Cuerden Valley Park. You can start the walk from the car park just west of the village and follow a shared cycling and walking trail through the park. Along the way there's ponds, woodland and some fine views to the surrounding countryside. To continue your waterside walking in the area head to the southern side of the village to pick up the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. You could follow this south to Chorley where you can explore the historic Astley Park .",
