  "description": "This walk climbs to the splendid viewpoint on Wolstonbury Hill in the South Downs. It's a lovely area with woodland trails, chalk grassland, wildflowers and wonderful views to the coast. The walk starts from the Jack and Jill Inn near Clayton, just to the north east of the hill. From here you pick up tracks heading west and then south to Wellcombe Bottom. You continue north west on paths surrounding the hill before climbing to the 206 metres (676 ft) summit. From here there are fine views over the hills and countryside of the South Downs and the Weald. View highlights include the Clayton Windmills, Chanctonbury Ring, the Devil's Dyke and Ditchling Beacon. After taking in the views you head north east on footpaths and a country lane before returning to the pub.",

You can find the pub at Brighton Rd, Clayton with a postcode of BN6 9PD for your sat nav. For some local history you could head into Hurstpierpoint and visit The New Inn. The inn dates back to 1450 and was built from old ships timbers, though the building now has a Georgian fa\u00e7ade. The cellar also has a strange tunnel (now bricked up) that is rumoured to lead to the church and Danny House some two miles away. Outside there's a lovely large garden area surrounded by beautiful flowers and old walls. In the Summer the Inn becomes there's garden parties, BBQ's, Hog Roasts, open air music & plays. You can find them on the High Street at postcode BN6 9RQ for your sat navs."
