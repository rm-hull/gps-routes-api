This route starts at the visitor centre and takes you alongside Castle Semple Loch before joining woodland trails to Park Hill. Cyclists can enjoy the lochside path which runs along National Cycle Route 7 from Glasgow to Irvine while the woodland trails are more suitable for walkers. At the southern end of the loch you will find the Lochwinnoch RSPB Nature Reserve where you can look out for a variety of wildlife from the bird hides.",

The shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line between Kilbirnie to Paisley. It's a nice surfaced path with views over Barr Loch and Castle Semple Loch to enjoy on the way. Head north and you can continue your lochside walking around the tranquil Knapps Loch in Kilmacolm ."
