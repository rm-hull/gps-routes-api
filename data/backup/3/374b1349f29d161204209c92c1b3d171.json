  "description": "This worthy village is located in West Yorkshire near the city of Leeds. The village is a nice place to start a walk with a couple of nearby long distance trails, riverside footpaths along the Wharfe to the north and one of the major highlights of the area to the west at Harewood House. There's also a fine Grade II listed pub to relax in afterwards. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Ebor Way and the Leeds Country Way to explore the surrounding countryside. On the way there's waterside paths along the River Wharfe and a visit to the splendid Harewood House . The walk starts in the village and follows a country lane north to meet up with the Ebor Way. Follow the waymarked footpath north west and it will take you to the River Wharfe where you can follow the riverside trail west towards Netherby. The route then leaves the river and heads south west to Harewood House. The expansive grounds include woodland, lakes, deer and lovely grounds. The route heads south from the park to link with the Leeds Country Way. You could take a detour south to visit the expansive Eccup Reservoir and the pretty Adel Woods if you have time. This route heads east along the Country Way, passing Sugar Hills Woods and Wike before returning to the village.",
