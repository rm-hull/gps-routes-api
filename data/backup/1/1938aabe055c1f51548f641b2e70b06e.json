  "description": "Climb to the 299\u00a0m (981\u00a0ft) summit of this hill in the Cotswolds and enjoy fine views over the surrounding countryside. The walk starts from the Worcestershire village of Overbury and climbs to Bredon Hill on good footpaths, passing woodland and streams on the way. At the summit you will find the Iron Age Hill Fort of Kemerton Camp and a small stone tower known as Parsons Folly or Banbury Stone Tower. There's also Roman\u00a0earthworks and several ancient standing stones. The hill is also a nature reserve so there is a wide variety of flora and fauna to look out for. This includes wild thyme, common rock rose, pyramidal orchid and dwarf thistle. These attract butterflies such as marbled white, brown argus and dingy skipper. Bredon\u00a0hill is mentioned in a poem of\u00a0A. E. Housman's anthology\u00a0A Shropshire Lad: 'In summertime on Bredon, The bells they sound so clear, Round both the shires they ring them, In steeples far and near, A happy noise to hear.' The whole of this circular walk is more suited for walkers as it uses some public footpaths but much of it uses bridleways which cyclists can also use. The Wychavon Way long distance footpath passes close to the hill so you could pick this up to extend your walking. An alternative circular walk to the hill is to follow the Wychavon Way from the nearby village of Ashton Under Hill before visiting nearby Elmley Castle .",
