  "description": "This walk explores Broak's Wood near Halstead in Essex. The woods include a notable Giant Redwood Grove with some wonderful towering specimens. There's miles of footpaths taking you around the ancient woodland with its interesting flora, fauna and ponds. The site includes Shardlow's Wood and a viewpoint with fine views over the surrounding countryside. In the spring time look out for the pretty bluebells and a variety of woodland birds. You can start the walk from the car park off the Hedingham Road on the western side of the woods. It's located just a few miles to the west of Halstead.",

Near here there's also Gosfield Hall and Gosfield Lake where there's some nice waterside trails and a good lakeside cafe. The 16th century hall is designated as a Grade I listed building and is now used for weddings."
