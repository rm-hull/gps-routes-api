In 1945 it was sold by the College to Rickmansworth Urban District Council, and is now owned and maintained by their successors, Three Rivers District Council."

Ebury Way follows the trackbed of the long dismantled railway line from Watford to Rickmansworth. Opened in 1862, it was shortly afterwards taken over by the London & North Western Railway, but was an early victim of the post-war Nationalization of the railways, closing to passenger traffic in 1952. It is now a popular route for cyclists."

The track has been completely cut, where it crossed Ascot Road about 300 metres east of here, for some time. There have been plans for many years to connect this line to the Metropolitan Line railway near Croxley station (a different station!) to provide direct rail access into the centre of Watford from the west, but nothing has so far materialized."

  "description": "This waymarked circular walk in Rickmansworth explores the area around the village of Croxley Green. The walk starts on the village green and heads north east towards Whippendell Woods. You could take a small detour from the route to explore the woods. Here you'll find lots of wildlife and a noteworthy avenue of lime trees dating back to 1672. The trail then passes Dell Wood before turning south east to follow a country lane down to the canal. On the opposite side of the water there's the popular Cassiobury Park to explore in Watford. This route heads south along the canal to Long Valley Wood where you cross the River Gade to enter Common Moor. Here you pick up a section of the Ebury Way and follow it west to Croxleyhall Farm. Continue north west and you will pass along the River Chess on the eastern side of Rickmansworth. The final section heads through Copthorne Wood before returning you to the village.",
