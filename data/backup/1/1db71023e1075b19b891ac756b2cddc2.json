  "description": "This expansive forest is located in the Dyfi Valley area of the Snowdonia National Park. There's miles of good mountain biking and walking trails to explore the area. In the forest there are wonderful views of the beautiful Afon Angell valley to enjoy as well. There's also lots of interesting flora and fauna with fungi, butterflies and a variety of woodland birds to see. Part of this loop uses a section of the Dyfi Valley Way which runs through the forest. You could extend your exercise by following it to nearby Dinas Mawddwy or Machynlleth. The towering Cadair Idris lies to the west. See the video below for an example of the mtb trails in the forest.",
