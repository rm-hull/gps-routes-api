  "description": "This walk follow the Saints Way from Fowey to the village of Golant. The route runs for a distance of about 3 miles with nice views of the River Fowey and woodland section through Colvithick Wood along the way. You'll also pass the noteworthy Sawmills Studios, a recording studio used most notably by musicians such as The Stone Roses (Fools Gold) and The Verve (A Storm in Heaven), Muse, Oasis (Definitely Maybe), Catatonia, Ride, Swans and Supergrass. The main building is a 17th-century water mill and the site has a documented history stretching back to the 11th century. Shortly after you enter the village of Golant which is also a delight with pretty cottages and some stunning views over the Fowey Estuary. The route can be started at the town quay in Fowey where you can pick up the Saints Way and follow the waymarked footpath north. The walk can be extended by continuing north along the Saints Way to Milltown and Lostwithiel. Back in Fowey the Fowey Hall Walk and the Fowey to Polkerris Walk are great options for further exploring this beautiful area.",
