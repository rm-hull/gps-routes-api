Positioned along the west coast, the cliffs overlook the vast Atlantic Ocean, providing a perfect nesting ground for a variety of species including Puffins, Guillemots, Kittiwakes, Razorbills, Fulmars, and even Corncrakes. Stroll along the clifftops on the off-road Roonivoolin walking trail and try to spot the numerous seabirds. From late April to early July, visit the Seabird Centre for up-close views of Puffins and other seabirds gathering in large numbers. Don't miss the unique 'upside-down' lighthouse, a distinctive feature overlooking the turbulent seas."

In addition to the rugged cliffs, the reserve encompasses unimproved grassland and several lakes. Roonivoolin, situated at the island's southernmost tip, provides a habitat where Lapwings, Corncrakes, Snipe, and Irish Hares flourish. Over the past four decades, changes in farming practices have led to significant declines in these species. Efforts have been made to create optimal habitats for Corncrakes at reserves such as Church Bay, Craigmacagan, Knockans, and Roonivoolin. These conservation initiatives are yielding positive results, with the birds now making regular returns to Rathlin Island for breeding, following a 20-year absence."

The island is a wonderful place for bracing walks, cliff top views and birdwatching. You can visit the island by catching a ferry from Ballycastle to the ferry port at Rathlin Island. From here you can pick up trails around the pretty harbour before heading south to the reserve and the lighthouse at the southern tip of the island.",
