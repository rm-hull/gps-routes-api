He used concrete cladding which was designed to replicate the black-and-white timber-framed architecture of the local Montgomeryshire farmhouses. As such it is among the earliest examples of concrete use in building in the modern era."

  "description": "This walk explores the estate of Gregynog Hall in the Powys village of Tregynon. The waymarked circular trail runs for just over 3 miles, passsing through the estate's attractive woodland parkland. On the way you can enjoy fine views of the Montgomeryshire countryside and the impressive mansion. There's fine wide lawns, topiary, sculptures, rhododendrons and a pretty lake to see in the grounds. You can also explore the Grade I listed gardens with specimen trees and a golden yew hedge. The woodland area is also a nature reserve with ancient oak, lichen and wildlife such as pied flycatchers and wood warblers to look out for.",
