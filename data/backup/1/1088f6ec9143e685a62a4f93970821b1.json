  "description": "Enjoy a short walk or cycle along this pretty lake in the Rhinogs. The lake is one of the sources of the River Artro which flows south westwards through Llanbedr and onwards to the sea. There is a car park at the eastern end of the lake where you can pick up the lakeside trail. It's a good surfaced track, ideal for an easy walk or cycle. The lake is surrounded by hills, rocky outscrops and interesting flora and fauna. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb Rhinog Fawr for great views over Snowdonia.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you could head towards the coast and pick up the Llanbedr Walk which will take you to the lovely River Artro Estuary and the Llandanwg Sand Dunes. Just to the east of the village there's also something of a hidden gem at the wonderful Nantcol Waterfalls. The area includes pleasant trails along the River Cwmnantcol with a series of rushing waterfalls to see along the way. There's also a circular walk around a small reservoir, just west of the falls. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks"
