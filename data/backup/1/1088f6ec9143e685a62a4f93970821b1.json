  "description": "Enjoy a short walk or cycle along this pretty lake in the Rhinogs. The lake is one of the sources of the River Artro which flows south westwards through Llanbedr and onwards to the sea. There is a car park at the eastern end of the lake where you can pick up the lakeside trail. It's a good surfaced track, ideal for an easy walk or cycle. The lake is surrounded by hills, rocky outscrops and interesting flora and fauna. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb Rhinog Fawr for great views over Snowdonia.",
