In 1970 Finchcocks was acquired by Richard Burnett, leading exponent of the early piano, and it now contains his magnificent collection of some eighty historical keyboard instruments: chamber organs, harpsichords, virginals, spinets and early pianos. About half of these are restored to full concert condition and are played whenever the house is open to the public. Finchcocks is a fine Georgian baroque manor noted for its outstanding brickwork, with a dramatic front elevation attributed to Thomas Archer. Named after the family who lived on the site in the 13th century, the present house was built in 1725 for barrister Edward Bathurst, kinsman to Earl Bathurst. Despite having changed hands many times, the house has undergone remarkably little alteration and retains most of its original features."

The head of water from this 16 acre lake once powered the giant hammer of John Browne's forge, the flames of which could be \"seen about the country at 10 miles distance\". With the abundance of iron ore in the local clay and of wood to fuel the blast furnace, Horsmonden in 1613 had 200 men employed in its iron foundry under John Browne. Such was Browne's skill in casting and proving guns that he was later granted a monopoly as \"Gunfounder for the King's Service\". In 1638 Charles I himself was here to watch a gun being cast. Browne also supplied guns to the Dutch, at that time the greatest sea power. Then, on the arrival of Cromwell and the Commonwealth, he was quick to switch his allegiance and was casting guns for Parliament until his death in 1651. When this former King's Gunfounder was buried, an impressive alabaster and black marble monument was erected to him in Horsmonden parish church\u00a0917323. But it stands there no longer. A 19th century Rector, an ardent Royalist, could not abide to see a memorial in his church to a man who had turned his coat for Cromwell, and removed it!"
