  "description": "This short circular walk takes you through the peaceful Holly Hill Woodland Park and along the estuary of the River Hamble. The park has two distinctive areas - Winnards Copse with a more formal landscape, lakes and ornamental exotic species and Cawtes Copse with its mix of native woodland species. There are two way marked trails of varying length following the footpath network around the site. The park is located in Sarisbury near Southampton and Fareham .",
