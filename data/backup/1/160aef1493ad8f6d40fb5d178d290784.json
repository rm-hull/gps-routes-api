  "description": "This fine London park has a series of well laid out footpaths to follow. You can start your walk from the Serpentine Car Park off West Carriage Drive. Then pick up the Mount Walk towards the Round Pond. This lovely ornamental lake is positioned in front of Kensington Palace. It was created in 1730 by George II. Look out for Model Yachts, Swans and Canada Geese as you make your way along the footpaths around the water. You can virtually explore the Round Pond by clicking on the google street view link below! The route then follows the Budge's Walk to the Italian Gardens next to The Long Water. Here you will find four fountains and a number of classical sculptures. The walk then passes along the Long Water to Serpentine Bridge, which marks the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. You can cross the bridge for splendid views across the Serpentine Lake into Hyde Park. The The Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk passes through the park so you can pick this up to extend your walk. It will take you through Hyde Park and St James's Park, visiting landmarks significant in the life of Diana Princess of Wales. The Jubilee Greenway also passes through the park so you can pick this up and head north to the Regent's Canal and Regent's Park. This route is designed for walkers but cycling is permitted in the southern part of the park along London Cycle Network route 44. This will also take you into Hyde Park. Here you can also pick up Cycle Superhighway 3. The popular trail runs from Lancaster Gate to Greatfields Park in Barking, passing several of the city's highlights on the way.",

It's well worth a visit with beautiful gardens, wildlife rich woodland, a stunning Japanese garden with waterfalls and a nice cafe for refreshments."
