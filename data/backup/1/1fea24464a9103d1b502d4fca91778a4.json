  "description": "This walk visits these two pretty reservoirs near Rishworth in West Yorkshire. As well as lovely views across the water there are some nice woodland sections and views of the River Ryburn which links the two reservoirs. It's a splendid area with the impressive Ryburn Dam and the attractive countryside and hills of the South Pennines making a great backdrop. The reservoirs are located close to Ripponden where you can pick up the long distance Calderdale Way to extend your walk. Here you can enjoy more waterside walking along the River Ryburn and the River Calder in Sowerby Bridge. Just to the south east of Rishworth you will find the lovely Scammonden Reservoir where there is a nice circular footpath around the water. The smaller Deanhead Reservoir lies just to the west as well. Just to the south is Booth Wood Reservoir where there's some nice footpaths to follow above the water.",
