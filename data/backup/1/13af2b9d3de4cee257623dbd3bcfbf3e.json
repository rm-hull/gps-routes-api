  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll along the lakes in this lovely park near Wakefield. There's two large lakes with sandy beaches and lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. The lakes are surrounded by attractive parkland and woodland with facilities including a cafe and a car park. It's great for families with play areas for children and pedalo hire on the lake. To extend your walk you can pick up footpaths around the site and head across Kinsley Common to Hoyle Mill Dam. Just a mile north of the park you will find Fitzwilliam Country Park. Here you'll find miles of waymarked walking trails taking you to grassland, woodland and ponds.",
