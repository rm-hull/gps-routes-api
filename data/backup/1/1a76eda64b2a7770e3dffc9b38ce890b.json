  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the historic village of Emley in Kirklees. The 6 mile trail visits the Emley Millennium Green before heading up into the surrounding countryside with glorious views of the Upper Dearne Valley. The route starts in the village by the post office and then heads south past the Millennium Green and Churchhill Farm towards Clayton West. This section includes views of the River Dearne and the photogenic old packhorse bridge in Clayton West. Here you will cross the River Dearne and pick up a section of the Kirklees Way, a long distance waymarked trail running through the area. Follow the footpath north to Woodhouse Farm and Furnace Grange where you turn west to Upper Crawshaw. From here you turn south east to return to the village. At the southern end of the route you could extend your outing by picking up the Dearne Way and following it east along the river to the nearby Bretton Country Park. There's some pleasant waterside paths around a pretty lake and miles of peaceful woodland to enjoy here. The site also includes the wonderful Yorkshire Sculpture Park which is one of the area's highlights.",
