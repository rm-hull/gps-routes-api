Well worth making this location a destination if not a stop on a journey through Pembrokshire."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Penally to Tenby on the Pembrokeshire coast. Penally is a pretty village located just to the west of Tenby. It's well worth exploring with some well-preserved Georgian and Victorian houses, fine local pubs and a popular sandy beach. This walk starts from the car park next to the train station in Penally. From here you can pick up the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and follow the waymarked trail north east along the lovely South Beach. After about a mile you will come to Tenby where you can follow the path around the scenic harbour and the pier. The trail then returns to Penally on alternative paths, heading through Tenby town and then along the northern side of the golf course. To extend the walk pick up the popular Tenby to Saundersfoot Walk and continue north to Monkstone Point and the lovely Saundersfoot beach.",
