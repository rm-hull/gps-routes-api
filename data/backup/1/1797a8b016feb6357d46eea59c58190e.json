  "description": "This walk explores the beautiful Biggin Dale National Nature Reserve in the Peak District. You can start the walk from the little village of Biggin, just to the east of the reserve. The Waterloo Inn is a good start an end point to the walk. From here follow public footpaths south to Dalhead before turning west to reach the reserve. A footpath then heads south through the site, passing the caves before reaching  the River Dove at Wolfscote Dale. You can extend the walk by continuing along the delightful riverside paths either to the south or north west. As a nature reserve there's lots of different plants and wildflowers to see in the warmer months. The limestone scenery encourages pretty flowers such as purple orchid, harebells and bluebells in the spring.",
