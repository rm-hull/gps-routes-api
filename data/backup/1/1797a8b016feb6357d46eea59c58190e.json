  "description": "This walk explores the beautiful Biggin Dale National Nature Reserve in the Peak District. You can start the walk from the little village of Biggin, just to the east of the reserve. The Waterloo Inn is a good start an end point to the walk. From here follow public footpaths south to Dalhead before turning west to reach the reserve. A footpath then heads south through the site, passing the caves before reaching the River Dove at Wolfscote Dale. You can extend the walk by continuing along the delightful riverside paths either to the south or north west. As a nature reserve there's lots of different plants and wildflowers to see in the warmer months. The limestone scenery encourages pretty flowers such as purple orchid, harebells and bluebells in the spring.",

There's a friendly, cosy interior while outside there are several tables with village and countryside views.

      "content": "Head east of the dale and you can pick up the Tissington Trail. This shared cycling and walking trail is a great way to see the area. If you continue south along the river you will soon come to Dovedale. This beauty spot is one of the highlights of the national park and includes the famous stepping stone. Also near here is the climb to Thorpe Cloud which gives fabulous views over the dales. To the west there's the circular Wetton Walk which takes you to the splendid Thor's Cave and the historic Wetton Mill where there are some delightful riverside tea rooms. The circular walk from Hulme End can also be picked up here. For more walking ideas in the area see the White Peak Walks page."
