  "description": "Explore the delightful water meadows at Houghton Mill on this walk in Huntingdon. It's a lovely area with views of the River Great Ouse, pretty streams, weirs and beautiful countryside. The walk starts from the National Trust car park at Houghton Mill. \u00a0The working 18th-century watermill\u00a0is set in an idyllic location on an island in the Great Ouse River. Follow the footpaths south along the water towards Battcock's Island and Hemingford Grey . Here you have the option of visiting Hemingford Grey Manor which dates from the 12th century. The interesting house and gardens are open to visitors. The route then turns north to pass along another stream before picking up the riverside path to return to the mill. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the lovely tea room which overlooks the mill. You can also buy some freshly ground wholemeal flour from the shop. You can extend the walk by heading east along the Ouse Valley Way towards St Ives . This section of the path visits 'The Thicket Path' where you will pass along an attractive avenue of trees. The site is located just a couple of miles east of Huntingdon and Godmanchester . You can easily follow the Ouse Valley way to the mill as an alternative start point. It will take you past Hemmingford Abbots and Hemingford Meadow with great views of the Ouse Valley plain. Just to the west of Huntingdon you will find Hinchingbrooke Country Park . Here you can explore 170 acres of open grasslands, meadows, woodlands and lakes. It is easily reachable on foot from the mill by following the river path through Godmanchester.",
