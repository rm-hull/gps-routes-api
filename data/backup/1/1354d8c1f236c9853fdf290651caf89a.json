  "description": "Enjoy an easy walk along the River Maine in the pretty town of Castleisland in Kerry in south west Ireland. The pleasant stroll follows the River Maine to the south of the town. In addition to spotting a variety of waterfowl, there are notable buildings along the way. The walk begins on the outskirts of the town on the Killarney Road, and includes waymarked posts to follow. Notable features include a gaunt tower on the left side of the river. This is all that remains of the famous Castle of the Island, built in 1220. Further along, you can enjoy views of the fine 19th-century church designed by Ashlin and Pugin.",
