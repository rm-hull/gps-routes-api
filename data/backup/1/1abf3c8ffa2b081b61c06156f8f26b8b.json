It follows the line of an old salt-carrying railway line between Winsford and Cuddington (near Delamere Forest) that operated for almost one hundred years before closing in 1966. Here there is a car park off Bradford Road with an interpretation board. The sign to the left of shot marking the terminus appears to be one of the old station platform signs suitably annotated."
