It follows the line of an old salt-carrying railway line between Winsford and Cuddington (near Delamere Forest) that operated for almost one hundred years before closing in 1966. Here there is a car park off Bradford Road with an interpretation board. The sign to the left of shot marking the terminus appears to be one of the old station platform signs suitably annotated."

  "description": "A lovely, short  cycle or walk on a disused railway line, running from Cuddington to Winsford through the Cheshire countryside. You'll pass woodland, lakes and the River Weaver while enjoying fabulous views of Cheshire. The route finishes in Winsford where there are a number of pretty lakes and an 18th century canalside pub. Around Newchurch Common you could create a little circular walk by heading arund the pretty lakes of the Marton Sands Nature Reserve. There are rail links at either end and a car park with toilets in Winsford.",
