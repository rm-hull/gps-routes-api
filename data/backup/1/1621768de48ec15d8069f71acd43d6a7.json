  "description": "This pretty West Sussex village is located within the South Downs National Park near Midhurst and the splendid Petworth Park. The attractive village boasts a remarkable 13th-century church and an early 17th century pub for refreshments. Additionally, the nearby small village of Selham is known for its outstanding pub and for hosting one of Britain's smallest churches. This circular walk from the village takes you to Graffham Common and Lavington Common. Both commons are located very close to the village and include miles of footpaths across attractive heathland and woodland. On the way there's lots of wildlife to see and fine views across the South Downs countryside. On the common you can also pick up the Serpent Trail long distance footpath to explore the area further. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Graffham. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
