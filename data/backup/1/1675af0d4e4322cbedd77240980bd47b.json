  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Crammel Linn waterfall near Gilsland on the border between Cumbria and Northumberland. The picturesque spot is something of a hidden gem and a popular place for walks, picnics and swimming. You can start the walk at the Gilsland Hall Hotel in the village. Then follow a footpath north along the River Irthing, passing the Popping Stone and Collering Woods. After just under 2 miles you will come to the photogenic Crammel Linn waterfall. The waterfall is 7.6 metre (25 ft) high and looks impressive after rain. The scenic river gorge is also good for wildlife spotting with Peregrine falcons nesting in the trees and cliff. Deer can also sometimes be seen roaming in the forested areas. The path along the river can be muddy in wetter months so it is advisable to bring a good pair of walking shoes. For more information on geography and history of the surrounding area see wikipedia's River Irthing page.",

      "content": "Just a mile to the south of Gilsland you can pick up the epic Hadrian's Wall Path and visit the fascinating Birdoswald Roman Fort. The fort is the most impressive of the remaining defences along the Wall today. Housesteads fort with its visitor centre and museum is a little further away to the east. On the way you would also find the remains of Thirlwall Castle which lies just over a mile east of Gilsland, near Greenhead village. The castle dates back to the 14th century and is well worth of a visit for its historical significance. If you head a few miles west along the wall there's another historic local highlight at Lanercost Priory. The English heritage run site was originally founded in 1169 as an Augustinian monastery. Today the substantial priory ruins are well worth a visit for the fascinating history and architecure. For more walks in the area see the North Pennines Walks and Northumberland National Park Walks pages."
