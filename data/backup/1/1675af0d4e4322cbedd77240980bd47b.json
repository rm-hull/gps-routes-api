  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Crammel Linn waterfall near Gilsland on the border between\u00a0Cumbria\u00a0and\u00a0Northumberland. The picturesque spot is something of a hidden gem and a popular place for walks, picnics and swimming. You can start the walk at the Gilsland Hall Hotel in the village. Then follow a footpath north along the River Irthing, passing the Popping Stone and Collering Woods. After just under 2 miles you will come to the photogenic Crammel Linn waterfall. The waterfall is 7.6 metre (25 ft) high and looks impressive after rain. The scenic river gorge is also good for wildlife spotting with Peregrine falcons nesting in the trees and cliff. Deer can also sometimes be seen roaming in the forested areas. The path along the river can be muddy in wetter months so it is advisable to bring a good pair of walking shoes. For more information on geography and history of the surrounding area see wikipedia's River Irthing page.",
