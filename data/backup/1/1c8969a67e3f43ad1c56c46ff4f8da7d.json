  "description": "Climb Hambledon Hill and enjoy far reaching views over the Cranborne Chase AONB on this walk near Child Okeford in Dorset. On the hill you will find one of the country's best preserved Iron Age hill forts. The area is also a National Nature Reserve so there is an abundance of interesting flora and fauna to look out for. Plants include pyramidal orchid and wild thyme while butterfly species include dingy skipper, grizzled skipper, chalkhill blue and adonis blue. From the 192 m (630 ft) summit there are fabulous views over rhe Blackmore Vale, the river Stour, Wiltshire and Somerset. This circular walk starts from the village of Child Okeford and follows country lanes and the Stour Valley Way to the hill summit. You then descend back to the village via Fernhayes Copse. The Stour Valley Way and the Wessex Ridgeway both cross the hill so you could pick up either of the long distance trails to extend your walk. One option would be to continue south east to Hod Hill for more great views and another historic hill fort.",
