This listed building called a Tentering or Drying Tower used to contain wooden frames on which cloth was stretched in order that it would remain in shape while drying. The mill lower down the hill in Stubbins, which this tower belonged to, was built in 1877 by the local textile manufacturing family the Porritts. In those days the newly made cloth was brought up the hill from the mills in the valley below to dry with the help of the wind passing through the tower."

  "description": "This walk explores the Stubbins Estate on the West Pennine Moors in Lancashire. It's a popular place for walkers with miles of trails to follow around the wooded hillside, farmland and Pennine moorland. Starting in Stubbins you will first head towards the ruined Tentering Tower, an old industrial building dating from 1866. The building was used to stretch cloth from the mill so it remained in shape while drying. It was held in frames using tenter hooks, hence the expression being 'on tenter hooks'. You can explore the interesting ruined building and enjoy some fine views over the area as well. The trails will take you north past the lake at Cliffe Lodge to Buckden Wood where there are some nice woodland trails and a waterfall. To extend the walk you could climb to the splendid viewpoint at Peel Tower and explore more of the expansive Holcombe Moor .",
