  "description": "This walk in the Mourne Mountains takes you along the Carrick Little trail from Blue Lough. The popular trail provides fine views of the surrounding mountains with some interesting geology to enjoy on the way. There's also pretty streams or tributaries of the Annolong River which flows through the area. You can start the walk from the Carrick Little car park where you can pick up a trail heading alongside the small lake. The trail then head south passing Annolong Wood, the Percy Bysshe outcrop, the old Douglas Crag quarries and the imposing Slieve Binnian which rises to the west of the path. The linear walk runs for about 2.5 miles, so 5 miles there and back. For a more challenging walk try the Slieve Binnian Walk which starts from the same car park and climbs to an amazing viewpoint.",
