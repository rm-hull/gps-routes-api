  "description": "This historic village is located in the Low Weald area of Kent, a few miles south of Sutton Valence. This circular walk starts from the train station in the village and explores the area to the south of the settlement. On the way you will enjoy views of the surrounding countryside and the River Beult. The route runs for just over 2 miles, using public footpaths running through the area. Also look out for the photogenic old oasthouses around Bletchenden and Waterman Quarter. See the list below for a number of other walks near and around Headcorn.",
