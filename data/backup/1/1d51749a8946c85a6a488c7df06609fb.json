  "description": "This historic village is located in the Low Weald area of Kent, a few miles south of Sutton Valence. This circular walk starts from the train station in the village and explores the area to the south of the settlement. On the way you will enjoy views of the surrounding countryside and the River Beult. The route runs for just over 2 miles, using public footpaths running through the area. Also look out for the photogenic old oasthouses around Bletchenden and Waterman Quarter. See the list below for a number of other walks near and around Headcorn.",

      "content": "Head north to Sutton Valence and you can pick up the Greensand Way. This major long distance walk follows the ridge of greensand rock through Surrey and Kent. Here you can also visit the ruins of the 12th century Sutton Valence Castle for some local history. You can then climb up to the castle and enjoy wonderful views over East Sussex and the Weald of Kent. Just to the east there's the worthy village of Smarden to explore. Here you'll find a number of picturesque cottages, an historic 14th century pub and a noteworthy church which has been described as the 'Barn of Kent' due to its high scissor beam roof."
