  "description": "Visit this spectacular promontory in Rhossili on this wonderful coastal walk on the Gower Coast. Worm's Head is shaped like a giant sea-serpent and marks the most westerly tip of Gower. It's a unique place and one of the most fascinating features of this beautiful area of Wales. Start your walk from the National Trust's car park at Rhossili, where there's a visitor centre with lots of information about the area. You can then pick up the coastal path to Kitchen Corner where you descend to the Worm's Head causeway. At low tide you can cross the causeway on foot to reach Inner Head. You can also see the remains of several shipwrecks, wood from the wreck of the Helvetia being the most prominent when looking north from Rhossili. The causeway is only exposed for about two and a half hours before and after low tide, so please check the tide times before attempting the walk. After crossing the causeway you climb up to Inner Head which stands at a height of 47 metres (154 feet). Continue west and you will come to the wonderful Devil's Bridge, a natural rock bridge leading to Outer Head. To extend your walking in the area you can try our Rhossili Circular Walk which takes you around the headland with wonderful views of the beautiful Rhossili Bay and beach. The Rhossili Bay Walk will take you along the beautiful beach before climbing to the high point of the Gower on Rhossili Down. The long distance Gower Way also passes through the area. You can follow it east and visit the wonderful Cefn Bryn, an elevated sandstone ridge known as the 'backbone of Gower'.",
