  "description": "Visit the Stonehenge of the Lake District on this fascinating circular walk in Keswick. You can start your walk from the roadside parking spaces at the junction of Eleven Trees and Castle Lane. You can see this on the google street view link below. On the opposite side of the road you'll find a gate and footpath leading to the stone circle. A short walk takes you to the site which dates from 3,300 to 900 BC, during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages. The area is surrounded by some beautiful countryside with views towards Helvellyn, Skiddaw, Grassmoor and Blencathra. It's an atmospheric and beautiful setting, attracting many visitors each year. After exploring the site you can turn it into a longer circular walk by following a public footpath which runs through the surrounding fields. Then return on Castle Lane to the car park. The site is located just over a mile from Keswick so you could also walk or cycle from there. If you'd like to continue your walking in this lovely area then you could pick up the Keswick Railway Path. It runs along a dismantled railway line just to the north of Castlerigg. You can enjoy views of the River Greta and explore Brundholme Wood from the path. Also nearby is the climb to Latrigg Fell.",
