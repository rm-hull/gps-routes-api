  "description": "This popular walk from Grassington visits the spectacular Linton Falls in the Yorkshire Dales. You start off in the lovely village of Grassington and soon join the River Wharfe for a waterside stroll which takes you past the falls. There is a bridge across the river which affords fabulous views of the falls below. The route returns to Grassington through countryside footpaths. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Dales Way and head along the River Wharfe through the beautiful Wharfedale. Also nearby is the delightful Grimwith Reservoir which has a walking path around its perimeter. Just a few miles to the east is the wonderful limestone gorge at Troller's Gill .",

      "content": "Just to the west of Grassington you'll find the worthy village of Threshfield. The pretty settlement includes an historic 16th century inn and the nearby Threshfield Quarry. The quarry is an unusual and atmospheric place for a walk with its limestone rocky cliffs and distinctive turquoise lakes. The Grass Wood Nature Reserve is located just to the north west of the town. There's some nice woodland trails, bluebells in spring and lots of wildlife to see here. The reserve is notable as one of the largest areas of broadleaved woodland in the Dales."
