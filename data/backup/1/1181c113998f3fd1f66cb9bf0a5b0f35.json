  "description": "This historic Welsh village is located in North Pembrokeshire, close to Cardigan and the Teifi Estuary on the coast. This walk from the settlement visits the historic Cilgerran Castle before following riverside paths along the River Teifi to the neighbouring village of Llechryd. The walk starts in the village at the ruined castle which dates back to the 13th century. It's a wonderful sight with the two impressive round towers overlooking the river gorge. From here you can then follow a footpath east along the river passing the Conacle Centre where there's a series of handy information boards and a car park. It's a nice place to stop for a browse and learn about the history, flora and fauna of the area. The route continues past Cnwcau before coming to the noteworthy Llechryd Bridge. The photogenic stone bridge dates back to the 17th century and is Grade II listed. Cross the river here and you can then explore Llechryd village. If you'd like to extend your walking in the area then continue east to visit Cenarth Falls where you can see the leaping salmon in the autumn months. The historic town of Newcastle Emlyn and its ruined Norman castle, can also be visited in this area. If you head north you can visit Cardigan and enjoy a coastal walk to the ruined abbey at St Dogmaels , the sandy beach at Poppit Sands and the wonderful viewpoint at Cemaes Head.",
