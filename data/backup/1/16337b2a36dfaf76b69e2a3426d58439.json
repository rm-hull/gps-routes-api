  "description": "These woods in Leigh on Sea have some nice trails and lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. You can start off at the car park by the Essex Wildlife Trust Belfairs Nature Discovery Centre on Eastwood Road. Then follow the trails heading west into Belfairs Wood and Hadleigh Great Wood. The nature reserve is a great place for wildlife with Great spotted woodpecker, Nuthatch and the rare heath fritillary butterfly to look out for on the walk. Also look out for the wooden animal sculptures dotted around the trails. It's easy to extend the walk by heading a short distance south west to visit Hadleigh Country Park . The popular park is nearly 400 acres in size and includes a mix of woodland, pasture, hay meadow and marsh.",
