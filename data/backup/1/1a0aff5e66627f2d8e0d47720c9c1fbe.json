  "description": "These woods in Okehampton have miles of nice cycling and walking trails to try. Abbeyford Woods is located just north of the town next to the River Okement. There's a good sized car park just off the country lane which runs through the centre of the woods. Alternatively you could walk to the woods along the Tarka Trail from Okehampton. It's about a one mile walk from the centre of the town. In the woods you will find wonderful Douglas Fir trees and beech trees. Look out for wildlife including roe or red deer, redstart, pied flycatcher, nightjar and buzzard. It's a lovely place for a shady afternoon stroll or for mountain bikers looking for some trails in Devon. The Tarka Trail runs through the woods so you can continue along this path to extend your exercise. You can also pick up the Granite Way in Okehampton which is a great cycling and walking trail along a disused railway line.",

The pub retains many of the old features, including oak beams and an inglenook fireplace that now contains a wood burner. They also have a nice garden area for warmer days. You can find them at Folly Gate, Okehampton EX20 3AH."
