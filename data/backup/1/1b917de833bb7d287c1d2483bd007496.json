  "description": "This Somerset based town is located near the Mendip Hills where there are plenty of opportunites for walkers. There's also some nice walks along the River Somer which runs through the town centre. This circular walk from the town takes you along a Fiver Arches Greenway rail trail to neighbouring Radstock before returning through the countryside on the country lanes to the north of the town. On the way you'll pass the village of Clandown and also climb to Pow's Hill and Kitley Hill where there are nice views over the surrounding area. The rail trail and country lanes are also suitable for cyclists. To continue your walking around the town head north to pick up the waymarked Limestone Link footpath. Near here there are also some nice woodland trails in Greyfield Woods at High Littleton.",
