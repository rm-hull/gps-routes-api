  "description": "This pretty little village is located in a lovely rural location in the chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. It is surrounded by the attractive countryside of the valley of Sydling Water, a small river which flows from Up Sydling until it joins the River Frome near Grimstone. Sydling St Nicholas is also located on the Wessex Ridgeway, a long distance footpath running all the way to Lyme Regis on the Jurassic Coast. Other features include 18th century cottages on a chocolate box High Street, a noteworthy 15th century church and a fine centuries old pub to relax in after your exercise. This circular walk uses part of the Wessex Ridgeway to explore Buckland Hill before visiting the neighbouring hamlet of Up Sydling. From the high points there are some excellent views over the countryside and hills of the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. You could extend the walk by heading east to visit the neighbouring village of Cerne Abbas where you can enjoy a walk to the photogenic hill figure at the Cerne Abbas Giant. The delightful Minterne Gardens in Minterne Magna are also not far from the northern end of the trail.",
