  "description": "This Northamptonshire based town is located just north of Rothwell in the northern part of the county. This short walk in the town visits the High Street, the historic 13th century church and the Millennium Green. It's a pleasant footpath taking you south past the green and into some pleasant countryside with horses and cattle grazing. The green is something of a hidden gem which includes a scented sensory garden and a butterfly garden. There's also benches situated in the meadow and native species of trees to see in this fine spot. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Desborough. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
