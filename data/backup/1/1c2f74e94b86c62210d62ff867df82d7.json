  "description": "This splendid Nature Reserve has a fabulous cycling and walking path around the perimeter of the huge artificial lake.  The route starts at Oakham and soon joins the waterside path towards Whitwell and the nearby Butterfly centre.  You continue to Edith Weston, Manton and Egleton where you will find the birdwatching centre at Egleton Bay. Rutland water is excellent for birdwatching with a wide variety of winged visitors including Osprey, Cormorant and Lapwing. Cycle hire is available at Whitwell. Three long distance walking trails run along the lake. You can pick up the Macmillan Way, Hereward Way or Viking Way to extend your walking in the area. For cyclists National Cycle Route 63 runs along the lake. It will take you through the heart of the National Forest from Burton on Trent to Wisbech",
