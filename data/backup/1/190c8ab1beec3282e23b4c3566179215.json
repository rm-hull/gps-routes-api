    "description": "Explore over 200 acres of woodland, meadows and wetland habitats in this popular country park in Penarth. Cosmeston Lakes has a number of accessible gravel paths and wooden boardwalks taking you around and between the two large lakes which form the centrepiece of the park. Around the lakes are bird hides where you can look out for mute swans, mallards, herons, egrets and diving birds such as the great crested grebe. The reedbeds around the lake also support a great deal of wildlife - look out for dragonflies and the rare Bittern. Other walking paths take you through the peaceful woodland with oak, ash, elm, hawthorn and blackthorn trees. Look out for birdlife that includes woodpecker, tree creeper, nuthatch, tits and buzzards. The wildflower meadows are also beautiful with the Sully Brook running through and a wide variety of plantlife including cowslips, primrose and birdsfoot trefoil, bee orchid, pyramidal orchid, butterfly orchid and the pink willow herb. Look out for rabbits and foxes in this area of the park. Also in the park is a reconstructed 14th century medieval village where costumed guides show you around the period furnished buildings. Cosmeston Lakes is located just a few miles from Cardiff and Barry, near to the coast at Penarth.",

It will take you through the local woods to the pretty Cadoxton River. The river is one of the shortest in Wales and includes weirs and a salmon leap. The Penarth Walk starts from the nearby town and visits the park. It will take you along the coast to Lavernock Point where there are fine views over the Bristol Channel."
