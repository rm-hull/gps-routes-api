  "description": "This Shropshire based market town is considered the northern gateway to the Shropshire Hills AONB. As such it's a great place for walking with two of the area's highlights reachable on foot from the town. This walk takes you to nature reserve at The Ercall before climbing to the popular viewpoint at The Wrekin. The walk starts in the town centre near the train station and the bus station. You then head south through the town, passing the market and the National Trust's Sunnycroft. The Victorian house gives an insight into the lives of a pre first world war brewer and his family. There's also a tea room and a beautiful garden for a stroll. The route continues south before crossing over the motorway to enter The Ercall. The geologically fascinating nature reserve includes some impressive ancient rocks, bluebell woods and interesting wildlife. Continue south west through the woods and you will pass the pretty reservoir at Lawrence's Hill before climbing to the Wrekin. The distinctive hill is something of a local landmark and one of the most popular walking attractions in the county. From the 407 m (1,335 ft) summit there are marvellous views over 17 counties on a clear day. This last section follows part of the Shropshire Way. The long distance waymarked footpath could be used to extend your walking in the area. You could follow it south to visit nearby Telford where you can pick up the Ironbridge Way .",

There's also a good sized garden for the warmer months. You can find them at 54 Market Street, TF1 1DT. For some history head to the Old Orleton - a 17th century former coaching inn. The Grade II listed pub can be found at Holyhead Road, with postcode TF1 2HA for your sat navs."
