  "description": "This large area of beech woodland near Slindon has some nice footpaths to follow. The woods are a great place to see bluebells in the spring months. You may also see deer, woodland birds and various butterflies as you make your way through the forest. You can start your walk from the car park located at the south eastern end of the woods, just to the north of the village of Eartham. The woods are part of the wider National Trust owned Slindon Estate. The 1400 hectare estate has miles of excellent trails with wonderful views over the South Downs to enjoy. The Monarch's Way also runs through the woods. You could pick up the long distance trail and head east to the nearby Houghton Forest. The expansive Goodwood Country Park is just to the west while the Grade II listed Halnaker Windmill and viewpoint is also very close by.",
