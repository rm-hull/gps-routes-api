Thomas Woodstone is running first, on this exploratory spate paddling trip during the wet summer of 2007. The level was good for this drop, but a bit on the low side for most of the rest of the descent. At a normal summer level only a trickle wets the large limestone slab, draining over the edge just beyond the line taken here."

  "description": "This walk visits the Appersett Viaduct before a stroll along the River Ure in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The five arched Victorian viaduct used to carry the Northallerton to Garsdale railway line over the Widdale Beck. The walk starts at the viaduct, just south of the village of Appersett and a couple of miles west of Hawes. Here you can follow paths along the Widdale Beck taking you past the old viaduct. You can then pick up a footpath heading west along the River Ure towards Mossdale Gill where there are a series of pretty waterfalls. The walk can be extend by heading to the pretty Cotter Force Falls just to the north.",

      "content": "The circular Garsdale Walk starts from the nearby Garsdale train station on the Settle and Carlisle Line. It's a beautiful place with trails along the Grisedale Beck and more pretty waterfalls to see. The area lies just a few miles to the north west of Hawes. Near here there's also the noteworthy Uldale Force. This impressive waterfall is located in a striking limestone gorge on the River Rawthey. There's also a series of smaller waterfalls so the area is well worth a visit especially after rainfall. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks page."
