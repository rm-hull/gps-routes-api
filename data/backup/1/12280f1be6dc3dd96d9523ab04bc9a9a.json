  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the Snettisham Coastal Park Nature Reserve on the Norfolk coast. The RSPB reserve contains saline lagoons, salt marsh and mudflats with a huge variety of wildlife to look out for. The walk starts from the Snettisham Beach car park where you can pick up trails heading north towards Heacham Harbour. You can create a circular loop around this arfea using coastal paths and inland paths. The route then returns to the car park to head south and visit the nature reserve. You'll loop around the lagoons in the reserve before visiting Shepherd's Port and returning to the car park. On the way you'll pass a number of bid hides where you can look out for species including avocet, bar-tailed godwit, knot andf pink-footed geese. From late summer to early winter tens of thousands of wading birds gather on the mudflats where they roost overnight.",

      "content": "The Heacham Circular Walk links with this one at the northern end of the route. The trail will take you north towards Hunstanton. The Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path can then be picked up here and followed towards the Titchwell Nature Reserve near Thornham. There are more excellent bird watching opportunites in this area. Just a few miles south there's some interesting local history at the 12th century Castle Rising. Here you'll find the ruins of an English Heritage owned castle surrounded by impressive earthworks.  Head south and you can explore Sandringham Country Park where there's some beautiful parkland surrounding the Royal residence. On the western side of the estate you'll also find the interesting village of Wolferton. Here you can visit the noteworthy Wolferton Railway Station. The now disused station was well known during the 1800\u2019s through its association with the Royal Family who used the station because of its proximity to Sandringham House. There are also trails to pick up around the Dersingham Bog Nature Reserve in this area. The reserve is part of the wider Sandringham Royal Estate and includes attractive heathland with interesting flora and fauna to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Walks page."
