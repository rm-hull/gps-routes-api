  "description": "This Hampshire based village is located near Winchester and Eastleigh in the Itchen Valley. This walk takes you along the River Itchen to neighbouring Shawford which lies just to the north. It uses part of the Itchen Way, a waymarked long distance trail runnning through the area. The walk starts in the village and heads east past Otterbourne Hill and Otterbourne Park Wood. You then meet up with the river near Brambridge House where there is a fine old manor house and a pretty weir on the river. The route then continues north along the river path to the neighbouring village of Shawford. You can extend the walk by continuing north into Winchester where you can visit the historic cathedral and enjoy a climb to the splendid viewpoint at St Catherine's Hill .",
