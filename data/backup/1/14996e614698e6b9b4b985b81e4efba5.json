Brocket Hall was built by James Paine in 1760, although there had been two previous buildings on the site, the first dating from 1239. It was the home of two Prime Ministers, Lord Melbourne and Lord Palmerston, who died at Brocket in 1865 while in office. It was later the home of the Baronets Brocket, the third Baronet converting it into a hotel, which is its current use. It is grade I listed"

  "description": "This pretty Hertfordshire village near St Albans has some nice trails to follow around the area's rivers, woodland and countryside. This nice circular walk explores the area to the east of the village, visiting the River Lee, Brocket Hall , Lemsford and Sherrardspark Wood . It's a varied route, with waterside sections and peaceful woodland trails to enjoy. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the Lea Valley Walk long distance trail. The waymarked footpath heads east along the river to Waterend and Brocket Hall. This is a very pretty spot with the 18th century hall surrounded by parkland and a lake known as the Broadwater. Here the route turns north to Ayot Green and Sherrardspark Wood. There's lots of nice woodland trails here with various woodland birds to see including nuthatches, treecreepers, woodpeckers, thrushes, robins, tits and wrens. After exploring the wood you head west to pick up the Ayot Greenway . This shared cycling and walking trail will lead you all the way back into Wheathampstead. To continue your walking around the village you could head south and visit Nomansland Common. There's 52 acres\u00a0of heathland and woodland here which is popular with dog walkers. If you continue west along the river you can explore the town of Harpenden , while Welwyn Garden City lies just to the east. The expansive Heartwood Forest is also not too far away.",
