  "description": "This North London Borough is well served with a number of local parks, common land, woods and waterways to explore. Being close to the Hertfordshire border there's some lovely open countryside with miles of leisurely trails to try. This walk around Barnet uses sections of the London Loop , the Dollis Valley Green Walk and the Pymmes Brook Trail to create a circular walk through the borough. The walk starts from the train station in New Barnet and heads east to pick up the Pymmes Brook Trail. Follow the waterside trail north and it will take past Cockfosters to the pretty Beech Hill Lake on Monken Hadley Common in Hadley Wood . You could take a small detour east here to visit Trent Country Park where there's lakes and a Japanese Garden to see. This route heads west along the London Loop through the common to the village of Monken Hadley. You then turn south skirting the eastern edge of High Barnet and Chipping Barnet before linking up with the Dollis Valley Green Walk. This will take you towards the pleasant Brook Farm Open Space and delightful village of Totteridge where you could visit the picturesque Darlands Nature Reserve. The reserve is one of the hidden gems of Barnet and includes a lake and lots of wildlife. This route turns east through East Barnet to link up with the Pymmes Brook again. Follow it north through Oak Hill Park and it will take you back towards the train station where the route finishes.",
