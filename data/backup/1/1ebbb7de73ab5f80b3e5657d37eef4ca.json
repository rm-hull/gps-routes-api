During the dissolution of the monasteries Richard Pollard acquired the property and later in 1649 it was bought by Edmund Prideaux, Attorney General to Cromwell. He converted the building and made it into a house. It is still in private ownership and open to the public. Today there was a wedding and one can just about see the guests enjoying the sunshine on the lawn outside the house."

  "description": "This former Cistercian monastery has 30 acres of award winning gardens to explore. It's perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll in beautiful surroundings. You can extend your walk by picking up the Jubilee Trail which starts at the abbey. The long distance trail crosses from one side of Dorset to the other, taking you on a tour of some of the county's best scenery and prettiest villages. You could also pick up the Liberty Trail and follow it east to Winsham and Wayford Woods. The delightful woods include streams, a lake, Rhododendrons and bluebells in the spring months. They are well worth a visit after exploring the abbey if you have time. Also nearby is the large park at Cricket St Thomas where there's more nice trails taking you to peaceful lakes, secluded woodland and beautiful gardens.",
