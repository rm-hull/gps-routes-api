  "description": "This waymarked circular walk explores the area surrounding the Hertfordshire town of Welwyn Garden City. The trail runs for about 12 miles, visiting many of the highlights of the area. The walk starts to the north of the town in Digswell where there is a train station and car park at the Digswell Viaduct. From the car park head west and you will pass the pretty Digswell Lake and Nature Reserve where you can see a variety of wildlife. The route bends round to visit Sherrardspark Wood where there's some peaceful woodland trails with bluebells in the spring months. Keep your eyes peeled for Muntjac Deer and various woodland birds as you make your way through this area. You continue south to Lemsford where you will pass the Lemsford Springs Nature Reserve. There's nice views of the River Lea, a pretty weir and more birdlife to see here. This area also includes Brocket Hall Estate where there's paths along the photogenic Broadwater Lake and a fine 18th century Palladian bridge. You then follow the course of the river south east through Stanborough Park. The attractive park has a series of lakes with other features including a Watersports Centre, Nature trail, Lakes, a Restaurant and a Coffee Shop where you could stop for a rest and refreshments. The trail continues to Mill Green where you turn north east to the Commons and Rolls Wood. The route then cross the River Mimram at Tewin Mill House and passes the lovely Tewin Bury Farm. Another local attraction the estate includes picturesque gardens, the Tewin Nature Reserve, the Grade I listed St Peter's Church and a farm shop. From here you head west to return to the car park in Digswell. Part of the walk links up with the Lea Valley Walk which can be used to further explore the area.",
