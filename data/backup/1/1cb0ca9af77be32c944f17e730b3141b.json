  "description": "These delightful little woods near Flamborough are perfect for a peaceful afternoon's stroll. The woods are located right next to the coast, just east of Sewerby Hall. In February you will find snowdrops covering the area, while in spring carpets of bluebells appear. The area is also a nature reserve so look out for wildlife including deer, squirrels and a variety of woodland birds. You can start your walk from the car park just off the Flamborough Road. From here you can pick up the nice woodland footpaths which will take you around the site, including a visit to the lovely beach. There's nice coastal views towards Bridlington from the cliff tops. The woods are located very close to Flamborough Head which is a great place for extending your walk. The splendid area includes towering white chalk cliffs, coves, caves, pretty bays and the oldest surviving lighthouse in Britain. Just up from Flamborough Head is the splendid Bempton Cliffs. The area is a RSPB Nature Reserve and considered the best place in England to watch seabirds.",
