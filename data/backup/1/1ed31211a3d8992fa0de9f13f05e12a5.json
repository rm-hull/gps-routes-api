      "subtitle": "Dog Walking",
      "content": "The estate is a fine place for a dog walk with miles of woodland and parkland trails. You are requested to keep them on leads in the grounds and they are not allowed in the house. There are bins dotted around the estate and doggy drinking stations are available near the toilets, adjacent to the gate that leads to the entrance to the house, and also in the Stables courtyard near the Carriage House Cafe exit. The Grouse and Claret pub mentioned above is also dog friendly. On the southern side of the estate you'll find the worthy village of Beeley where you can explore the expansive Beeley Moor and visit the village's excellent 18th century coaching inn. The Devonshire Arms originated as three separate cottages in 1726 and was subsequently converted into an Inn in 1747. Visitors were transported by coaches from London and the Peak, stopping in Beeley's coaching inn so the horses could rest. Among them was the renowned author Charles Dickens, who visited frequently during his lifetime. It is also said that King Edward VII often met his mistress Alice Keppel at the inn. The inn serves good quality food and includes a pleasant garden area for warmer days. They also provide roooms if you would like to stay in the area.
