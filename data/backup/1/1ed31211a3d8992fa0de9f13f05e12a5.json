  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the splendid Chatsworth Park in the Derbyshire Peak District. There's 1000 acres of parkland to explore with views of the River Derwent, woodland trails and fallow deer. The park is in a great location for walking with some great options for extending your exercise. You could pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way long distance footpath which runs past the estate. You can follow it north to Baslow or south to Calton Lees. About a mile north east of Chatsworth you can enjoy a climb to Birchen Edge . The gritstone edge provides stunning views over the Derwent Valley from the high points. The park is not far from the lovely town of Bakewell. You could reach it by following the Bakewell Circular Walk from the town. This visits the nearby village of Edensor and the medieval Haddon Hall which is also well worth a visit.",
