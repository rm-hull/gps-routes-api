  "description": "This Berkshire based village is in one of the most picturesque spots on the River Thames. In the area there's a pretty lock and weir with the little hamlet of Sonning Eye on the opposite side of the river. The village also includes a historic waterside mill where you can enjoy refreshment after your exercise. This walk from the village takes you along a pleasant section of the Thames Path to the neighbouring village of Shiplake. It's an easy stroll running for a distance of just over 3 miles along the flat path. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the National Trail and follow it east along the river to Shiplake and Lower Shiplake. On the way you'll pass Hallsmead Ait, Phillimore's Island and some rushing weirs.",
