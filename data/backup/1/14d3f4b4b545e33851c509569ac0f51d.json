The River Glen, running south to north, is channelled to provide drainage and flood protection. The flood banks are further apart than normal here though. Although mainly still arable farming, these are the first cows we have seen since leaving Boston on the Macmillan Way 24 miles earlier. The brick pillars in the middle distance are the remains of a bridge over the river carrying the Bourne to Spalding railway, closed in 1959. Beyond are two poles carrying owl nesting boxes, provided by the Hawk and Owl Trust. Most are inhabited by anything other than owls these days though."

  "description": "This pretty nature reserve near Spalding has three colour coded walking trails to try. The reserve is located on the River Glen so there are nice waterside paths to follow. It is a typical fenland setting with meres, flooded pastures, hay meadows and reedbeds. Look out for lots of water loving wildlife such as black tailed godwit, marsh harriers, wigeon, teal, lapwing, redshank and snipe. You may also spot an otter or water vole by the river. The Macmillan Way runs through the reserve along the river so there is scope for extending your walk. Heading west will take you towards Thurlby while heading east takes you into Pinchbeck near Spalding. Also nearby is Bourne Woods where there are miles of walking and cycling trails through ancient woodland with a mixture of conifers and broad-leaved trees, ponds and sculptures.",
