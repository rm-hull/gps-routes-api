  "description": "Hill Top is the 17th century former home of children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter. It is located in Near Sawrey in the Lake District National park and open to the public. You can tour the house and gardens where expert guides will tell you all about the life and works of Beatrix Potter. This nice short walk is ideal for visitors to Hill Top to try after or before their visit. It takes you up to the lovely Moss Eccles Tarn - Beatrix Potter owned the tarn and donated it to the National Trust after her death. It served as an inspiration for some of her stories. Alfred Wainwright described it as the 'most attractive tarn on Claife Heights'. It's stocked with water lilies and fish, and surrounded by pretty rhododendrons. A pleasant walking trail leads up to the tarn and you can return the same way or through other woodland tracks.",
