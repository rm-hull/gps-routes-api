  "description": "Hill Top is the 17th century former home of children's author and illustrator\u00a0Beatrix Potter. It is located in Near Sawrey in the Lake District National park and open to the public.\u00a0 You can tour the house and gardens where expert guides will tell you all about the life and works of Beatrix Potter. This nice short walk is ideal for visitors to Hill Top to try after or before their visit. It takes you up to the lovely Moss Eccles Tarn \u00a0- Beatrix Potter owned the tarn and donated it to the National Trust after her death. It served as an inspiration for some of her stories. \u00a0Alfred Wainwright\u00a0described it as the 'most attractive tarn on Claife Heights'. It's stocked with\u00a0water lilies\u00a0and fish, and surrounded by\u00a0pretty rhododendrons. A pleasant walking trail leads up to the tarn and you can return the same way or through other woodland tracks.",
