  "description": "This 17th century country house near Cambridge is surrounded by 3,000 acres of parkland and farmland. There are miles of walking paths taking you to the walled garden with glasshouse and vegetable plots, the glorious parterre with 12,000 plants and the delightful pleasure gardens. There's also the opportunity for a quiet woodland stroll through Cobbs Wood where you can look out for eight species of woodland bat. The site includes Home Farm with its donkeys, shire horses and rare breed livestock. It's great for families as children can groom the donkeys and have a drive on a mini tractor. There are also 18th century farm buildings including  cart sheds, stables, cattle yards and deer pens. You can also explore the house with its grand rooms and collections of furniture, porcelain and paintings. If you would like to continue your walk you could pick up the Wimpole Way and head north to visit the Hardwick Wood nature reserve. The long distance trail will eventually lead you into Cambridge.",
