  "description": "This circular walk explores Foulness Island on the east coast of Essex. The island is an internationally important site for migrating and breeding birds, including pied avocets. It has a number of public footpaths but it's owned by the MOD so you must not only access them when the Red Flags are lowered and the Range is not active. The walk starts in the village of Churchend in the centre of the island. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north west to the coastal paths along the River Roach and the River Crouch. You can then follow riverside paths before heading inland to Courtsend and Fisherman's Head on the south side of the island. Here you can pick up the Thames Estuary Path and follow the waymarked trail south west to Eastwick Head, Rugwood Head, Asplins Head and New Burwood Head. Here you turn north to follow inland trails back to Churchend, passing Priestwood and the Turtle Wall on the way.",
