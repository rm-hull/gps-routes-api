    "description": "Enjoy a lovely woodland trail along Carron Valley Reservoir on this easy walk near Stirling. The walk is known as the Loch Shore Trail and takes place on good waymarked paths, with a short boardwalk section at the start. There's lovely views across the large reservoir, pretty little woodland burns and lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. Keep your eyes peeled for Crested Grebe, Golden Eye, Tufted Duck and Osprey as you make your way along the trail. In the woods you may also see red deer, red squirrel and even the elusive pine marten. The walk starts from the car park at the eastern end of the water. From here you can directly pick up the trail heading west along the reservoir. It will take you past the play areas to a lovely viewpoint overlooking the water. There's also picnic sites and a cafe near the car park for refreshments. To continue your walking in the beautiful Carron Valley, you can enjoy a more challenging climb on the Meikle Bin Trail which starts from the car park at the northern end of the reservoir. Also of interest is the fascinating Duncarron. Here you will find the complete reproduction of a fortified village from the early Middle Ages of Scotland. You can also try one of the challenging, red graded mountain bike trails which start from the car park and take you through the woodland to the south of the reservoir.",

Here you can find out all about the trails around the forest which include and exciting single track red trail. The openstreet map above also shows some of the trails with names and blue markings. These include the Cannonball Run, the Pipedream and the Runway. Just to the west there's the Loup of Fintry where you'll find beautiful 94ft high waterfalls. Head south and you could visit Banton Loch on the lovely Colzium Estate near Kilsyth. The estate includes some peaceful waterside trails and the historic Colzium House. In the grounds there's a ruined 16th century castle and some beautiful gardens to admire. To the south west of Stirling there's a nice circular trail around the picturesque North Third Reservoir to try."
