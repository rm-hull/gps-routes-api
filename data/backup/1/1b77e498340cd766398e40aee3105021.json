  "description": "This walk takes you from the English Channel to the Bristol Channel, through the Devon and Somerset countryside. The walk begins on the south coast at Seaton in Devon, and first heads towards Axminster, passing through Seaton Down and Colyton, crossing the River Coly as you go. At Axminster, you join the River Yarty for a long riverside stretch towards Bishopswood, passing the Horse Pool Camp univallate Iron Age hill fort enclosure on the way. The walk continues through the beautiful Blackdown Hills AONB, climbing Staple Hill which offers fabulous views as the highest point in the Blackdown Hills. You then descend through wooded areas and the village of Pitminster to Taunton, the county town of Somerset. The path then  takes you on from Taunton through the stunning Quantock Hills towards Cothelstone Hill and then on to Stogumber. The final section takes you to the finish point at Watchet passing two historic sites on the way. First you will come to the Orchard Wyndham historic house, parts of which date from medieval times. Shortly after you come to the Battlegore Burial Chamber which is a Bronze Age burial chamber at Williton. The end point of the walk is the lovely harbour town of Watchet which sits on the Bristol Channel.",
