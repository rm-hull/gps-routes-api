  "description": "Climb to this prominent hill on the Mid-Cheshire Ridge on this lovely walk in Cheshire. Frodsham or Overton Hill stands at a height of 500 feet (152 metres) offering fabulous views over the Cheshire Plain and the Mersey estuary. The walk also visits Woodhouses Iron Age Hillfort which is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The walk starts at the Frodsham Hill car park just to the south of the hill on Bellemonte Road. From here you can pick up the North Cheshire Way to the Frodsham War Memorial. The sandstone obelisk is dedicated to the memory of the fallen in World Wars I and II and sits on Frodsham Hill. From here you pick up the Sandstone Trail and head south west along the ridge to Woodhouse Iron Age Hillfort. You then turn around and follow woodland trails back to the start point. To extend your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Helsby Hill where there's another Iron Age Hillfort, more great views and nice woodland trails. The Delamere Way also passes the hill. You can follow it south east to visit Delamere Forest and Blakemere Moss Lake near Kelsall .",
