  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the delightful Barrington deer park in the Great Barrington area of the Cotswolds. The walk starts in the village of Barrington Parkand follows footpaths around the deer park before a waterside section along the River Windrush returns you to the village. There are splendid views of the Cotswolds hills to enjoy also. The village is located just a short distance east of the National Trust's Sherborne Park. If you head west you could visit the pretty Windrush Mill and then continue on to the park. There's nice footpaths here with pleasure grounds, wildlife sculptures, woodland trails and waterside paths along the Sherborne Brook. Near here you will also find Lodge Park where there are more good National Trust footpaths. The Cotswold Way and Monarch's Way long distance trails can also be picked up to the west of the village.",
