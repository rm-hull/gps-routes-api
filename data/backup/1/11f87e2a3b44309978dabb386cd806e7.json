  "description": "This long circular walk explores Snowdonia's rich mining history. The area is designated as a World Heritage Site and includes a number of fascinating old quarries and historic mining villages. It's a beautiful and often remote area with the mountains of Snowdonia making a spectacular backdrop to the striking abandoned quarries. The walk starts in Bangor and first heads south to Bethesda, passing the Penrhyn quarry which was once the world's largest slate quarry during the 19th century. The site is now home to Zip World where you can enjoy an exhilarating ride on the fastest zip line in the world. The route then turns south west to Padarn Country Park. Here you'll find the beautiful Llyn Padarn and Llyn Peris with some fine waterside walks and the fascinating National Slate Museum. On the northern side of the lake there's also the Dinorwic Quarry to explore. It's another significant site as at one time the quarry was the second largest slate quarry in the world, after the aforementioned Penrhyn. You continue to Waunfawr before coming to Llyn Nantlle Uchaf and the Dorothea Quarry. The 19th century slate quarry is now flooded and a popular place for scuba divers. You can still see the old pump house and the Cornish Beam Engine which dates back to 1904. The route continues east past the lovely lake to Rhyd Ddu which marks the start of the Rhyd Ddu Path to Snowdon. You head south from here through the woodland trails of the expansive Beddgelert Forest to Beddgelert where you can explore the stunning Aberglaslyn Pass. The trail then heads east through Croesor before passing the beautiful Tanygrisiau Reservoir and the impressive Llyn Stwlan Dam before arriving at Blaenau Ffestiniog. The town is one of the highlights on the route with the heritage Ffestiniog Railway and the fascinating Llechwedd Slate Caverns. Here you can find out about the history of slate quarrying and specifically the Llechwedd quarry in which it is located. The chief attraction is the Deep Mine Tour which has the steepest narrow gauge railway in the UK and travels over 500 feet underground to the disused slate caverns. The route then passes Llan Ffestiniog and Llyn Morwynion before coming to Cwm Penmachno. There's a series of quarries here with the opportunity to pick up The Penmachno Mountain Bike Trail in the area. The trail then heads north through forested areas towards the popular village of Betws y Coed where you can explore the delightful Fairy Glen and Swallow Falls. From here you head west to Capel Curig, the home to the Plas Y Brenin, National Mountain Sports Centre. Here you can visit the lovely Llynnau Mymbyr or climb to the viewpoint at Moel Siabod. The next stage takes you past the stunning Llyn Ogwen before coming back to Bethesda. From here you can retrace your steps to the finish point back at Bangor.",
