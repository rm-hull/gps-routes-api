  "description": "This Hampshire based village is in a great spot for exploring the countryside of the South Downs. This circular walk explores the ancient Butser Ancient Farm before heading to Windmill Down. You can start the walk from the car park of the farm which lies just to the east of Clanfield. The farm is described as an archaeological open-air museum and includes reconstructions of Neolithic dwellings, Iron Age roundhouses, a Romano-British villa and an early Saxon house. It's a great place to learn all about the history of these ancient civilisations, while enjoying some tremendous views of the surrounding hills. After exploring the farm you can pick up public footpaths heading across Clanfield Down to Windmill Hill. Here you will find the Chalton Windmill, a Grade II listed building which lay derelict until the late 1970s, when it was restored and converted into a private residence. From this elevated spot you can enjoy more wonderful views over the South Downs. To extend the walk head just a mile north and you can explore Queen Elizabeth Country Park. The expansive park includes miles of woodland trails and a climb to the wonderful viewpoint on Butser Hill. The South Downs Way and Staunton Way long distance trails can also be picked up in this area.",
