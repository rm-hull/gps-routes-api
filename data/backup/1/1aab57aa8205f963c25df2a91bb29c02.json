  "description": "An easy circular walk around the Portsbury Wharf Nature Reserve in Portishead. The attractive 113 acre site provides a vital buffer of green land between Portishead and the Portbury Dock industrial complex. You can start the walk fro the Portishead Marina car park, located next to the reserve. Here you can pick up footpaths heading east onto the site, which includes two large pools, several ponds, grazing marsh, hay meadows and hedgerows. There's also a number of bird hides where you can look out for a variety of wildlife. Keep your eyes peeled for curlew, dunlin, redshank and shelduck as you make your way around the site. To extend your walking in the area you can try the popular Portishead to Clevedon Walk. The walk starts from the nearby Portishead Lake and includes pretty bays, nice beaches, sandstone cliffs and great views across the Severn Estuary into Wales. You could also pick up the Gordano Round and explore the splendid Gordano Valley.",
