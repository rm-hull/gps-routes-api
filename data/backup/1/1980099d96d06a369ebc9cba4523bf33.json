  "description": "Explore the 255 acre estate of this Anglo-Saxon burial site and enjoy lovely views of the River Deben. It's a historically fascinating area set in the beautiful Suffolk countryside and run by the National Trust. There's a number of good walking paths with woodland trails and riverside footpaths to enjoy. The site was discovered in the summer of 1939 and is one of the richest finds in English archaeology. You can learn about the find in the on site exhibition which includes replica treasures and original finds from one of the mounds, including a prince's sword. This circular walk starts from the visitor centre and visits the burial mounds just to the south. This includes the Ship Burial where the remains of a 90ft-long, clinker-built wooden ship of the seventh-century, were found in 1939. From here you can then follow paths through woodland to Ferry Cliff where there are splendid views over the River Deben to the town of Woodbridge and its working Tide Mill. Paths then lead through Deben Wood before crossing the estate and returning to the car park. The site is located on the eastern edge of Rendlesham Forest. It's a great place to extend your walk using the UFO trail which takes you to some of the areas connected to the UFO sighting in December 1980. On the other side of the river you can pick up a number of trails from Woodbridge. The River Deben Walk will take you all the way to Felixstowe. Another waterside trail, the Fynn Valley Walk will take you from the town to Witnesham along the River Fynn.",

      "content": "In 1939, Edith Pretty, the owner of land at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk, entrusted archaeologist Basil Brown with the task of exploring the largest of several Anglo-Saxon burial mounds on her estate. His excavation led to an extraordinary archaeological discovery. Beneath the mound lay the imprint of a ship measuring 27 metres in length. At its heart was a decayed burial chamber, filled with a treasure trove: Byzantine silverware, exquisite gold jewellery, an opulent feasting set, and an intricately designed iron helmet. This remarkable burial, dating back to the early 600s AD, was likely dedicated to a high-ranking personage of the East Anglian Anglo-Saxon kingdom, possibly a king. The ship burial at Sutton Hoo has shed light on the early Anglo-Saxon era in England. It reveals a society known for skilled craftsmanship and far-reaching international ties, extending across Europe and beyond. The discovery corroborates the world of grand halls, shimmering treasures, and formidable warriors depicted in Anglo-Saxon poetry as being more than mere legend. Edith Pretty generously donated the discovered items to the British Museum in 1939, where they now form an impressive display in the gallery. The Ramsholt Walk can be picked up just to the south at Methersgate Quay. This will take you along the eastern side of the river Deben to the delightful village of Ramsholt. There's a pretty quay, a beach and a splendid riverside pub to visit in this remote, unspoilt spot."
