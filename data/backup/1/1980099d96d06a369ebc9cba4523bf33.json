  "description": "Explore the 255 acre estate of this Anglo-Saxon burial site and enjoy lovely views of the River Deben. It's a historically fascinating area set in the beautiful Suffolk countryside and run by the National Trust. There's a number of good walking paths with woodland trails and riverside footpaths to enjoy. The site was discovered in the summer of 1939 and is one of the richest finds in English archaeology. You can learn about the find in the on site exhibition which includes replica treasures and original finds from one of the mounds, including a prince's sword. This circular walk starts from the visitor centre and visits the burial mounds just to the south. This includes the Ship Burial where the remains of a 90ft-long, clinker-built wooden ship of the seventh-century, were found in 1939. From here you can then follow paths through woodland to Ferry Cliff where there are splendid views over the River Deben to the town of Woodbridge and its working Tide Mill. Paths then lead through Deben Wood before crossing the estate and returning to the car park. The site is located on the eastern edge of Rendlesham Forest . It's a great place to extend your walk using the UFO trail which takes you to some of the areas connected to the UFO sighting in December 1980. On the other side of the river you can pick up a number of trails from Woodbridge. The River Deben Walk will take you all the way to Felixstowe . Another waterside trail, the Fynn Valley Walk will take you from the town to Witnesham along the River Fynn.",
