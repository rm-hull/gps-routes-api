  "description": "Travel on the marvellous Talyllyn Railway to Dolgoch and visit the beautiful Dolgoch Falls on this circular walk in the Snowdonia National Park. You can pick up the steam operated railway from the seaside town of Tywyn on the Cardigan Bay coast. It will then take you on a lovely journey through the Fathew valley to Dolgoch where a short walk will take you to the falls. There are footpaths taking you to the three levels of the falls which are spectacular in wet weather. Some of the paths are quite steep and can get a bit wet so a reasonable level of fitness and a good pair of walking shoes is advisable if you are going to do the whole trail. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area you can enjoy waymarked woodland walks in the Nant Gwernol ravine. Alight at Nant Gwernol station to enjoy these walks.",
