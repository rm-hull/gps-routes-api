  "description": "This splendid nature reserve in Retford has several waymarked walking trails to try. There's lots to see with waterside walks along several pretty lakes and the River Idle which runs right through the site. The expansive reserve covers 450 hectares with hundreds of species of wetland birds to look out for. These include gadwall, wigeon, pochard, lapwing and redshank. There's also streams, woodland trails and lots of interesting plants and flowers to enjoy. You can park at the car park just off the Great North Road at the southern end of the site. From here you can pick up the trails around the lake to the River Idle. There's several colour coded trails to try of varying lengths. Facilities include the Idle Valley Rural Learning Centre and a childrens bronze rubbing trail. This circular route is designed for walkers but there are bridleways and country lanes running through and around the site which are suitable for cyclists. To extend your walk you can pick up the Cuckoo Way along the Chesterfield Canal. The canal towpath runs just to the south of the reserve. Only a mile to the west you will find Daneshill Lakes Nature Reserve. There's more nice footpaths to follow around attractive wetland with lots more wildlife to see.",

The route takes you along the canal towpath before heading through the countryside to visit some of the local villages. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nottinghamshire Walks page."
