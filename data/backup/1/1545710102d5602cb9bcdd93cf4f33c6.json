Scammonden Dam was a joint project between Huddersfield County Borough Water Dept. and the MOT, who were building the M62 Transpennine motorway - the motorway is on the crest of the dam, a massive structure of clay and concrete 76m high and 610 m long, which took three years to construct. The valve chamber can abstract water at three levels. The reservoir is fed not only from the surrounding moors, but also from the Colne Valley hillside via a tunnel through the ridge. The Pennine section of the motorway was opened in 1971."

  "description": "A circular walk around the pretty Scammonden Water in Kirklees. There are footpaths alongside the reservoir with nice views of the surrounding countryside, hills and woodland. You will often seen sailboats on the water as there is a sailing club located at the southern end. There is also a large free car park at the north eastern end of the water. The largely flat trail runs for a distance of just under 3 miles so it's ideal for an afternoon walk. The Kirklees Way runs past the reservoir so you could pick this up to extend your walk. You could follow the trail to the nearby Deanhead Reservoir and then on to Slaithwaite Moor where you will find Cupwith Reservoir and splendid views over the surrounding moors. Just to the north west you will find Ryburn Reservoir and Baitings Reservoir near Rishworth. This walk has nice views of the River Ryburn and some woodland sections near the reservoirs. Just to the west you will find Booth Wood Reservoir where there's some nice footpaths to follow above the water.",
