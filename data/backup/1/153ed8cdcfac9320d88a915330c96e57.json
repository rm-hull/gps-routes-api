  "description": "Ilam Country Park is a delightful open space owned by the National Trust. It is situated on the River Manifold about five miles north west of Ashbourne in the Staffordshire and Derbyshire Peak District. Highlights in the park include Ilam Hall and gardens, Bunster Hill, Hinkley Wood, a Visitor Centre, tea-room and shop. The park is perfect for a short riverside stroll in one of the prettiest areas in England. It's easy to extend your walk in this beautiful area by heading to the nearby Dovedale . You can follow a footpath east for about 1 mile to reach the River Dove and the famous Dovedale Stepping Stones. You could also try our Ilam Circular Walk which starts from the park. It explores the valleys of the River Manifold and the River Hamps to the west of Ilam Park.",
