  "description": "Ilam Country Park is a delightful open space owned by the National Trust. It is situated on the River Manifold about five miles north west of Ashbourne in the Staffordshire and Derbyshire Peak District. Highlights in the park include Ilam Hall and gardens, Bunster Hill, Hinkley Wood, a Visitor Centre, tea-room and shop. The park is perfect for a short riverside stroll in one of the prettiest areas in England. It's easy to extend your walk in this beautiful area by heading to the nearby Dovedale. You can follow a footpath east for about 1 mile to reach the River Dove and the famous Dovedale Stepping Stones. You could also try our Ilam Circular Walk which starts from the park. It explores the valleys of the River Manifold and the River Hamps to the west of Ilam Park.",

      "content": "The Ilam Dovedale Circular Walk also starts from the car park at the park. This will take you up to up to Stanshope on country lanes before heading into Dovedale at the Dove Holes caves. It then visits the stepping stones and Lovers Leap before returning to the car park. The circular Fenny Bentley Walk visits Thorpe Cloud and Dovedale from the pretty village to the east. The village is worthy of exploration with the pretty Bentley Brook, a 14th century church and a fine inn with particularly lovely gardens to see. The route also visits the 17th-century Jacobean mansion house at Tissington Hall. The delightful village of Parwich lies just a few miles to the east of Dovedale. There's a pretty village green, old limestone cottages and a pub dating back to the 1600s. You can reach the village on the Limestone Way from Thorpe. For more walking ideas in the area see the White Peak Walks page."
