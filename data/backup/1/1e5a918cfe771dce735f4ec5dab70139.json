  "description": "This woodland area in the North York Moors has some good bridleways for mountain biking and nice walking trails. You can park at the car park off Mowthorp Road to pick up the tracks. Follow Middle Road through the centre of the forest before picking up Lady Mildred's Ride to return. If you head all the way through the woods you will come to Scarborough where you can pick up National Cycle Network Route 1. The woods are good for wildlife spotting with deer, badgers, squirrels, frogs, toads, foxes and various woodland birds to look out for. In the spring months there are also lots of bluebells. To extend your exercise you can head into the adjacent Forge Valley Woods . This nature reserve has a nice boardwalk trail along the River Derwent. The woods can be reached on the circular West Ayton Walk which starts from the delightful village. Just to the west is the expansive Wykeham Forest with miles more trails to try.",
