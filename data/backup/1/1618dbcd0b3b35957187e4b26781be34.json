Services were so arranged that it was possible to make a connection without delay to another train. Very sadly this station and all of its lines to the three towns mentioned above, was closed in 1955. It never had the benefit of diesel trains, which could have transformed the economics. With hindsight from 2007, a valuable asset was thrown away back in 1955."

  "description": "This large, elevated village is located in the Bradford area of West Yorkshire. It is notable for its old railway line and the Black Dyke Mills which is now a heritage venue where you can see concerts and learn about the village's interesting industrial heritage. This walk from the village uses part of the Great Northern Railway Trail and other public footpaths to visit one of the local highlights at Thornton Viaduct . It's about a 2 mile walk from the village to the viaduct, passing along the shared cycling and walking trail. From the top of the viaduct you can enjoy excellent views over the countryside Yorkshire Dales and Bronte country. To extend your walk you can continue along the rail trail to Hewenden Reservoir and Viaduct . To continue your walking around Queensbury head a mile east to visit Horton Bank Country Park and Brayshaw Reservoir.  There's some nice footpaths here taking you around pretty lake with lots of wildlife to see. There are also some hills in the park which you can climb for some wonderful views over the the city of Bradford.",
