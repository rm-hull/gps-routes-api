  "description": "This walk explores the area around the village of Gwithian on the West Cornwall coast. The circular route follows the South West Coast Path towards the Towans before returning along the lovely Gwithian Towans Beach. It's a lovely place for a walk with a wide surfers beach, sand dunes, wild grass, rock pools and Atlantic seals to look out for. You can start the walk from the Gwithian Bridge car park on the western side of Godrevy Head. Then follow the paths south west along the beach. You can extend the walk by exploring the beautiful Hayle Estuary. To extend the walk head east from the car park to explore Godrevy Head. The National Trust owned headland includes a lighthouse and some fine views over St Ives Bay.",
