  "description": "This pretty village is located near High Wycombe and Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire. The village has a pleasant, large green surrounded by trees and a series of Victorian and Edwardian properties. There's also an historic 16th century pub for refreshments after your exercise. This little walk around the village takes you from the green to Woburn Park. In the park you can follow nice footpaths along the River Wye and then into the woodland in the adjacent Farm Wood. To continue your walking in the area head west to Little Marlow. Here you can enjoy a walk around the Spade Oak Nature Reserve where you'll find a pretty lake with lots of wildlife to look out for. The village is also worth exploring with picturesque cottages, a 14th century church and a 16th century pub. You can pick up the Thames Path National Trail here and follow it towards Cookham and the splendid Cliveden House .",
