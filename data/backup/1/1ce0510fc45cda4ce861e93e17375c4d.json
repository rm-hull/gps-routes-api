  "description": "Enjoy a stroll through the historical Lancashire village of Ribchester before following a section of the Ribble Way to Hothersall. The circular route then returns to the village through the farmland to the west of Ribchester. There's some moderate climbing on the return leg with nice views to the hills of the Forest of Bowland on the way. The village has an interesting history with the ruins of Bremetennacum Roman Fort still visible. You can visit the Roman Museum and view archaeological finds from the site, including coins, sculpture and metalwork. It lies at the southern end of the Forest of Bowland near to Longridge Fell . The fell is a great place to extend your walking in the area with great views and peaceful woodland trails. The long distance Forest of Bowland Walk also passes the fell so you could pick this up to explore the southern section of the AONB. To the east of the village you can visit Whalley Abbey and enjoy more riverside paths along the River Calder. There's also some nice woodland trails in the nearby Spring Wood to try. Heading east along the Ribble Way will take you to Great Mitton and Hurst Green where you can pick up the Tolkien Trail . The literary trail explores an area connected with the Lord of the Rings trilogy including the 16th century Stonyhurst College. Just beyond Great Mitton you will find the attractive town of Clitheroe where you can explore the splendid castle and grounds.",
