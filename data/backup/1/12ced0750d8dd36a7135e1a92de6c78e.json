  "description": "This affluent Hertfordshire based village has some nice country and river trails to try. This circular walk from the village visits the River Colne and River Ver on the Ver-Colne Valley Walk before heading to the nearby Bricket Wood Common and the village of Aldenham. The walk starts at the Folly about half a mile west of the train station. Here you can pick up a footpath heading north to meet up with the Colne near Colney Street. Follow the Ver-Colne Valley Walk south west along the river and it will take you to Bricket Wood Common where there are some nice woodland trails. You'll also pass the confluence of the two river around Drop Lane. The route then head south east to visit the village of Aldenham. It's a pretty little village with a number of pre-19th century buildings that are listed buildings. The parish itself is largely unchanged, though buildings have been rebuilt, since Saxon times when the majority of the land was owned by the abbots of Westminster Abbey. From the village you then head east to Batlers Green, passing Kemprow on the way. The final section turns north to take you through the village and back to the start point.",
