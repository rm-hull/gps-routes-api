  "description": "This circular walk visits Threipmuir Reservoir near Balerno in the Pentland Hills. The route also visits the nearby Black Hill and the 16th century Bavelaw Castle which sits just to the south of the car park. You can start of at the reservoir car park at the western end of the water. Then pick up the footpaths heading north east along the water. At the eastern end you can cross the lake at the dam before following the Black Hill path to Bavelaw Castle. Finally the walk crosses the Redford Bridge to return to the car park. On the route there are splendid views of the surrounding Pentland Hills including Green Cleugh and Hare Hill. Also keep your eyes peeled for water loving wildlife on the lake and in the adjacent Red Moss of Balerno Nature Reserve. It's easy to extend the walk by visiting the adjacent Harlaw Reservoir where there's more nice waterside paths to enjoy.",
