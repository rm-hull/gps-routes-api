The pub was earlier named the Ring of Bells, although it is nowhere near Challacombe church. Here the drayman from St Austell Brewery takes empty kegs back to his lorry. The Black Venus was called that originally because of a sheep in the area that had black wool and was specific to Challacombe. It was named The ring O Bells in the 1950's when new church bells were hung but John Green (The Landlord) changed it to Black Venus in 1965 after he took over the pub."

  "description": "This small Devon village sits on the edge of the Exmoor National Park. The peaceful area includes pleasant country trails, an old mill and a noteworthy pub dating back to the 1500s. This circular walk from the village takes you to Barton Town and Challacombe Mill which lies just to the south west. The final section runs along a B road so you may prefer to return along the same footpaths. Head east onto Exmoor and you can pick up the popular Tarka Trail and the Two Moors Way . These waymarked, long distance trails are a great way of further exploring the area. To the west there's Wistlandpound Reservoir where you can enjoy some peaceful waterside trails. Near here is the National Trust's Arlington Court . There's a fascinating old carriage museum and some lovely trails through the gardens and parkland of this 19th century house.",
