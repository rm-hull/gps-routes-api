  "description": "This circular walk explores the deserted village of Risby in East Riding of Yorkshire. Risby Park includes lakes, woodland and some lovely views of the surrounding countryside. The walk is just under 3 miles and includes some short climbs. In the park you can see information boards about the history of the park. The foundations of Risby Hall can still be seen today in the fields near Risby. It was the home of the Ellerker family between the early 14th and the late 18th centuries but destroyed by fire in the 1780s. Start the walk from the Folly Lane Cafe where there is ample parking. You then pick up the footpaths heading west toward the medieval village, along Dunflat Road. A footpath then heads north past the site of the village before picking up another path to take you east past some pockets of woodland. You then turn south past Low Daw Hill and Folly Wood. Shortly after you return to the car park and the finish point. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the lovely Folly Lane Cafe. There's a great selection of meals and an outdoor balcony where you can sit and enjoy views over the park. The Beverley Twenty long distance footpath runs through the park so it's easy to extend your walk. You could follow the trail north to the village of Walkington which is also an alternative start point. Heading south will take you to Skidby where you could visit the Grade II listed Skidby Mill and the town of Cottingham. The High Hunsley Circuit also runs through the park. The circular route explores some of the loveliest areas of the Yorkshire Wolds. If you enjoy this walk then you should head to Wharram Percy in the Yorkshire Wolds. There's another fascinating medieval village here with a particularly impressive ruined church.",
