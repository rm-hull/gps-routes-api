The Itchen Valley Country Park is also located near here and is a fine place to stretch your legs. To the south you can pick up the Solent Way and follow it south east along Southampton Water to Royal Victoria Country Park. Near the quay you can also pick up the Southampton Walls Walk which will take you around the historic city walls. Just to the west is the neighbouring town of Totton where you can visit the wildlife rich Testwood Lakes and Lower Test Nature Reserve. The town is also close to the start point for the Test Way where you can visit the noteworthy Eling Tide Mill. The Grade II listed mill is a major local attraction with picturesque walks and some fascinating local history. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
