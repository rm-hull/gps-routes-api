The park also has a Wildlife Centre with interactive resources and educational facilities. Southampton Common can be found just north of the city centre near the main university campus. You can start the walk from the car park on Cemetery Road at the southern end of the common where you'll also find the Urban Wildlife Centre. From here you can pick up the footpaths and cycle trails heading north to the lakes and woods.",
