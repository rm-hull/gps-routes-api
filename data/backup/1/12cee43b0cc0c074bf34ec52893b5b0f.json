  "description": "This walk takes you to the beautiful Lanhydrock estate from Bodmin Parkway Train Station. You can catch a train from Truro or St Austell to Bodmin Parkway and then follow footpaths to Lanhydrock. It's a nice two mile walk along the River Fowey and through woodland to the National Trust owned Victorian country house. The estate is very special with wonderful architecture and beautiful gardens. There are 1000 acres of woodland, parkland and gardens to explore on a network of good footpaths. Highlights include the magnolia arch by the thatched cottage and beautiful herbaceous borders. You can also visit the magnificent house and explore the kitchen area, servants' quarters and museum. Although the whole of this route is designed for walkers cyclists can also enjoy a number of trails in the estate. There are easy, moderate and difficult trails to try. Click here to see a trail map or look at the Open Street Map link below which shows the trails marked in blue just to the north of the car park. You can also hire bikes within the estate. To continue your walking in the area head a couple of miles south and you can pick up the Saints Way long distance trail. You can then visit Helman Tor and the Breney Common Nature Reserve where you can enjoy fine views over Bodmin Moor and look out for wildlife including Ponies and the rare Orange Top butterfly. In nearby Bodmin you can pick up the Camel Trail cycling and walking route which will take you along the River Camel on a splendid traffic free path. The Cornish Way cycle route also passes close to the estate.",
