  "description": "This circular walk takes you from the National Trust's Rockcliffe to nearby Kippford in Dumfries and Galloway. It's a splendid stretch of coast with beaches, wildflowers and wonderful views across the Solway Firth. On the way look out for a variety of wading birds in the estuary and butterflies around the area's interesting flora. The walk starts at the car park in Rockcliffe and first follows a section of the Jubilee Path to the 6th century Mote of Mark hill fort where there are fine views to enjoy. The route continues across Muckle Lands to Kippford village. Here you can enjoy a section along the estuary of the River Urr with views across Rough Firth to the bird sanctuary at Rough Island. To extend the walk you could head south on the Sandyhills To Kippford Coastal Walk . This will take you to the lovely Sandyhills Bay via the fine viewpoint at Castlehill Point and the Needles Natural Arch.",
