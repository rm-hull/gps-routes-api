The gardens were begun by Sir Jon Vanbrugh and Charles Bridgeman before 1720, before being extended by William Kent. Capability Brown also made improvements. Today the gardens are a National Trust property."

  "description": "This is a walk through Claremont Park and the beautiful Claremont Landscape Garden in Esher. The park boasts a wonderful large lake, wide lawns and an unusual turfed amphitheatre. If you would like to continue your exercise why not visit the nearby Esher Common with its footpaths, woodland, ponds and cycle track. The Oxshott Walk visits the common from the train station in the  nearby village. It also visits Oxshott Heath and Woods and Fairmile Common. Oxshott is also notable as being one of the most expensive places to live in the country. Residents include several premier league footballers and tennis player Andy Murray.",
