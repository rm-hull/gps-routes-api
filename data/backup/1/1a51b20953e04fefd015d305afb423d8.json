Today the gardens are a National Trust property."

  "description": "This is a walk through Claremont Park and the beautiful Claremont Landscape Garden in Esher. The park boasts a wonderful large lake, wide lawns and an unusual turfed amphitheatre. If you would like to continue your exercise why not visit the nearby Esher Common with its footpaths, woodland, ponds and cycle track. The Oxshott Walk visits the common from the train station in the nearby village. It also visits Oxshott Heath and Woods and Fairmile Common. Oxshott is also notable as being one of the most expensive places to live in the country. Residents include several premier league footballers and tennis player Andy Murray.",

It enjoys a lovely setting in West End, a hamlet with little more than a few residential streets and a local farm shop, Garson\u2019s, where you can buy local produce and pick your own fruit and vegetables during the summer months. A large pretty green and duck pond are also just 30 metres away from the pub\u2019s front doors. You can find the pub at 48 West End Lane with a postcode of KT10 8LA for your sat navs. It's also dog friendly if you have your pet with you."
