  "description": "This reservoir in Stocksbridge has a nice walking trail to try. There's a parking area at the north eastern tip of the water where you can pick up the trail. Follow it west towards Ewden Village before crossing the Ewden Beck at the western end. Here you have the option of heading along New Mill Bridge to the adjacent Broomhead Reservoir. There's a similar circular trail to try here. On the southern side of the lake there's woodland trails through Wilkin Wood which will lead you back to the car park. You can extend your walking in the area by heading east and visiting the nearby Wharncliffe Woods and Grenoside Woods. Here you can also pick up the long distance Trans Pennine Trail .",
