  "description": "This walk takes you along the Lancaster Canal from Preston city centre to Haslam Park. The begins at the start of the canal at Maudlands in Preston, just to the north west of the city centre and train station. From here you can pick up the towpath heading north west to Haslam Park. You can leave the canal here and explore the good sized park which includes nice footpaths taking you to a lime tree avenue, lake, ponds, waterfalls and the rose and sensory gardens. It's also a designated nature reserve with wildflower meadows, open grassland and wetland. Look out for a variety of flora and fauna as you make your way through the park. After exploring Haslam Park you can pick up the canal and follow it back to Preston where the route finishes. To extend the walk continue west along the canal to Salwick and Swillbrook where there are nice views of the Lancashire countryside. To continue your walking in Preston city centre head to the lovely Avenham Park where you can pick up the Ribble Way and enjoy a nice riverside walk.",
