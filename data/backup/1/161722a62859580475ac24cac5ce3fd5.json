Ther walk starts in Aberdour where you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it east past the harbour to Hawkcraig Point. You continue along the beach and Silversands Bay to Bendameer House and Carron Habrou before coming into Burntisland. To extend the walk pick up the Dalgety Bay to Aberdour Coastal Path Walk and continue to the lovely Dalgety Bay and the ancient St Bridget's Church.",
