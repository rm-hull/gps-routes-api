  "description": "This walk takes you along Loch Riddon in the village of Tighnabruaich on the Cowal Peninsula, on the western arm of the Kyles of Bute in Argyll and Bute. The route uses a fine section of the waymarked Cowal Way to take you along the loch and the River Ruel before finishing at Clachan of Glendaruel. Along the way there are some glorious views over the Kyles of Bute and the surrounding mountains. To continue your walking in the area head east to Dunoon and try the Dunoon Bishop's Seat Walk. There's a fine viewpoint here and the ruins of the ancient Dunoon Castle to see.",
