  "description": "A circular walk around the parks and gardens at Ickworth in Bury St Edmunds. There are 1,800 acres of parkland to explore with lakes, woodland and arable fields to enjoy. The walk also takes you through the beautiful Italianate garden which is the oldest of its kind in England. Here you'll also find the 18th century Italian Rotunda, built by the 4th Earl of Bristol to house his collection of Italian art and sculpture. The route below is devised for walkers but much of the park is also great for cycling, with bike hire available from the Ickworth hotel. Please click here for more information. Also of interest is the Newmarket to Bury St Edmunds cycle route which runs along National Cycle Route 51 and passes close to Ickworth Park.",
