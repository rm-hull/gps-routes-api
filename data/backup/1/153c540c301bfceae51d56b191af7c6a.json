The castle and the hunting lodge, now the Abergavenny Museum, are Grade I and Grade II listed respectively."

  "description": "This lovely circular walk takes you around the pretty meadows surrounding Abergavenny Castle. You'll also enjoy a riverside stroll along the River Usk and a visit to the delightful Linda Vista Gardens. The route starts near the tourist information centre in Abergavenny and takes you along the River Usk on a good path which is also open to cyclists. The path then heads to Linda Vista gardens, which is a well laid out public park with a variety of plants and flowers. You then pass the ruins of the 11th century Abergavenny Castle where there is a good museum detailing the history of the castle. Please note, only the first section of the route along the river is open to cyclists. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area you could pick up the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal for more waterside footpaths. You could follow it south to visit nearby Pontypool where there are some fine trails around Pontypool Park. Heading west will take you to the pretty Gilwern Wharf where there's some lovely scenery and a fine canalside pub.",

      "content": "The neighbouring town of Bleanavon is located just a few miles south west of the town. You can explore the worthy town on the circular Blaenavon Walk. The area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which includes a fascinating industrial museum and a wonderful heritage steam railway. Also located north of the town on the slopes of Blorenge is the delightful Keepers Pond. The small lake is a popular place for easy walks, wild swimming and picnics. Head south east of the town and you could visit the ruins of Raglan Castle. The 15th century fortress is considered one of the grandest castles in the country.  A few miles to the west you'll find the splendid Clydach Gorge. The scenic steep-sided valley is where the River Clydach flows to the River Usk. The epic Cambrian Way passes through the town. The long distance waymarked route starts from the city of Cardiff and runs for nearly 300 miles through the Brecon Beacons, the Cambrian Mountains and Snowdonia before finishing on the North Wales coast at Conwy. For more walking ideas in the area see the Brecon Beacons Walks page."
