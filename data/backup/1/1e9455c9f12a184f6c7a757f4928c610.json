  "description": "This Cornish fishing port has some lovely coastal trails, countryside paths, a local reservoir, nearby parks and two scenic gardens to visit. It's also the place where you can catch the boat over to the Isles of Scilly where you can try the splendid St Mary's Coast Path . This circular walk from the town takes you along the coast before visiting some of the inland local highlights at Drift Reservoir , Trewidden Gardens, Trengwainton Gardens and the neighbouring village of Newlyn. The walk starts next to the Albert Pier where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow the waymarked footpath along the harbour and the docks towards Chimney Rocks. You continue south west to the promenade at Wherrytown, passing the coastal Bolitho Gardens before coming to Newlyn. The pretty village includes another nice harbour, a noteworthy art gallery and the Newlyn Coombe River. The route then heads inland to visit Drift reservoir where there's some lovely views across the water to the surrounding Cornish countryside. On the eastern side of the water there's the scenic Trewidden Gardens where there's some lovely trees, flowers and ponds to see. After exploring the gardens you head north towards Tremethick Cross and Boswednen where you can visit the Trengwainton Gardens. Here you'll find woodland trails, walled gardens, tranquil ponds and excellent views over the area from the elevated position of the site. From the gardens you head past the Boscathnoe Reservoir before descending back into the town. To continue your walking from the town pick up the St Michaels Way and head east to visit St Michael's Mount.",
