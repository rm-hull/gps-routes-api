A most attractive and unspoilt village, it has become a popular destination for yachtsmen, tourists and a sought after place to live, which is reflected its relatively high property prices. The village is believed to be named after 'Deedas', a Saxon chief, who probably settled here soon after the Saxon invasion of Devon in about 660 A.D. The village hosts an interesting and pleasing variety of building styles (and colours); this view is towards the ferry that crosses the River Dart."

  "description": "If you are visiting Dartmouth then this is a lovely walk to try. It takes you along a section of the Dart Valley Trail to the nearby village of Dittisham. It's a splendid area with wonderful views across the Dart River and some nice woodland trails through the woods just to the north of Dartmouth. It also passes the National Trust owned Greenway Estate where you can learn all about Agatha Christie's visits to the area. You can turn it into a longer circular walk using the ferries or just walk up and back along the same path on the western side of the river. The walk starts at the tourist information centre near Dartmouth Harbour. You then follow the waymarked path north west through the town and across Old Mill Creek. You continue north through woodland and countryside to Dittisham where you catch the little Greenway Ferry across the river to Greenway Quay. Here you can visit the Greenway Estate, the former holiday home of Agatha Christie. The estate is owned by the National Trust so you can explore the fascinating house and the beautiful gardens for a fee. It's a real highlight on the route with walled gardens, a peach house, vinery, woodland trails and views over the Dart Estuary. You can also explore the 1950s style house and learn all about Christie's holidays to the area. See the video below for more details. After leaving Greenway the route climbs to Oakham Hill before descending to the woodland trails in Long Wood. The final section takes you along Dartmouth Harbour to Kingswear where you can catch the ferry back to Dartmouth. You can extend the walk by heading to the lovely Coleton Fishacre from Kingswear. You can also visit Dartmouth Castle and the coast on the Dartmouth and the Dart Estuary Walk .",
