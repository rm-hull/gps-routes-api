  "description": "These pretty gardens in Handcross are ideal for a peaceful afternoon stroll. There's 27 acres to explore on well laid out footpaths. In the park you will find woodland trails, ponds, azaleas, rhododendrons, a lovely wildflower meadow and a collection of rare and exotic flowers and plants. The gardens are set on a hillside so there are marvellous views in all directions. The Handcross Walk starts from the village and takes you to the nearby Hyde Estate.",
