  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Seat Sandal fell near Grasmere in the Lake District National Park. You can start the walk from the layby parking just off the A591 at Mill Bridge. Head north from layby, crossing Tongue Gill before picking up the footpaths heading north east. The first section follows Wainwright's Coast to Coast along Tongue Gill to the Farfield Iron Mine. The route continues al the C2C to Grisedale Hause where you turn south west towards the Seat Sandal summit. From the 736 m (2,415 ft) summit you can see the Helvellyn and Fairfield ranges, the Solway Firth, the Scottish mountains and Morecambe Bay to the south. After taking in the views you descend back to the start point on the western side of Great Tongue. You could also descend on a section of the C2C via Little Tongue Gill. To extend your walk you can continue along the C2C to Grisedale Tarn which is just to the north of Seat Sandal. The path will eventually lead you to St Sunday Crag where there's great views over Ullswater. The fell is also very close to the route for the Fairfield Horseshoe which is another popular climb in the area.",
