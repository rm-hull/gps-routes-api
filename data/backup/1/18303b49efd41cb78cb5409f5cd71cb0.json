  "description": "This Cumbrian village is located just north west of Ravenstonedale in the Eden district of the county. This walk from the village takes you north to visit one of the local highlights at Smardale Gill Viaduct. The area is a National Nature Reserve with wildlflowers, woodland and grassland. You can reach the site by following a disused railway line north from the village for about 2 miles. To continue your walking in the area head south into the Howgills to climb to The Calf. It's a popular climb with fine views over the area to enjoy from the elevated spot. The village is also located on the Dales High Way - a long distance waymarked trail exploring the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park.",
