  "description": "Explore the old water meadows and woodland in this pretty nature reserve near Newbury. You can start the circular walk from the car park at the Ship Inn in the village of Ashford Hill. From here you pick up footpaths through the nature reserve towards Haughurst Hill and Sleepers Copse. The reserve is great for wildlife spotting with several species of butterfly to look out for amongst the wildflowers. Back in the little village you can enjoy refreshments at the Ship Inn. The Brenda Parker Way long distance footpath runs through the reserve so there is scope for extending your walk. Also nearby is Wasing Wood, riverside paths along the River Enborne and Greenham Common. The expansive area of heathland is covered in heather and gorse and has nice wide footpaths, wetland areas and wildflower filled grasslands with horses and ponies to look out for. To the east you'll find Pamber Forest with more peaceful woodland trails to try. There's also the worthy town of Tadley and the fascinating ancient Roman Fort at Silchester to explore here.",
