The wheel has been used to pump water to the Groudle Hotel and to provide power for the fairy lights that ran through the glen from the entrance to Lhen Coan. The wheel was known as the 'Little Isabella', (a reference to the Laxey Wheel). The wheel featured in a disguised form in the BBC series 'Lovejoy' in 1986 with a story which led to buried treasure being discovered in one of the paddles. In 1994 the wheel was refurbished by Laxey Towing Company and since that time it has operated sporadically in conjunction with train services."
