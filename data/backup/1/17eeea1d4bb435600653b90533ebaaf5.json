  "description": "This walk explores the scenic ridge of the Hog's Back in the North Downs near Guildford in Surrey. The elevated ridge is a great place to enjoy views over the surrounding area. To the north you can see landmarks in the city of London including Canary Wharf,\u00a0Tower 42,\u00a0The Gherkin,\u00a0Wembley Arch\u00a0and\u00a0Heathrow Airport. To the south is more rural with views to Hindhead and the Devil's Punch Bowl . The walk starts a short way south of Guildford train station where you can pick up a country lane heading south west to Henley Fort and the Hog's Back trackway. Follow the ancient track west onto Guildown where there are fine views back down to Guildford. The route then descends to pick up the North Downs Way and follow it west towards Puttenham at the western end of the site. You can then return across Puttenham Heath and Wanborough Common before heading back to Guildford where a final waterside section on the Wey South Path will take you back towards the train station.",
