  "description": "This fascinating city walk explores the area around the magnificent cathedral in the Staffordshire city of Lichfield. There's much to enjoy with interesting architecture, historic sites, pretty parks and lakeside trails. The walk starts from the tourist information centre on Market Street and heads north west to the lovely Minster Pool. The pool lies directly south of\u00a0Lichfield Cathedral\u00a0with views over the water to the wonderful building. It's a beautiful spot with an ancient avenue of\u00a0lime trees that are lit up at night. The trails pass along the pool before entering Beacon Park. There's 69 acres to explore here with the pretty Museum Gardens, Beacon Pool Lake and interesting sculptures including Captain Smith of the\u00a0RMS Titanic and King Edward VII. After exploring the park the walk turns to the north east passing Erasmus Darwin House and the cathedral. The building dates from the 12th century and is the only medieval\u00a0English cathedral with three spires. Highlights include a medieval wall painting, the famous Herkenrode stained glass and the Lichfield Angel. There's also a nice cafe which is a good place to stop for refreshments. Entry to the cathedral is free but you are encouraged to make a donation. You can also visit Erasmus Darwin House the home of Charles Darwin's Grandfather. Erasmus led a scientific revolution, founding the Lunar Society in the 18th century.\u00a0There's a museum where you can explore Darwin's work through interactive exhibits, replica costumes and historical objects. There's also a restored\u00a0Georgian\u00a0herb garden\u00a0that has been faithfully recreated with plantings of the period and features a relief sculpture of Erasmus Darwin. After exploring the cathedral area the walk heads to the delightful Stowe Pool reservoir. Nice footpaths take you around the water before returning to the tourist information centre. Just to the south of the tourist information centre you will find the Garrick Theatre, which is also well worth a visit. Also near here is the Samuel Johnson Birthplace Museum which is dedicated to the life and works of the author and\u00a0lexicographer\u00a0Samuel Johnson\u00a0who wrote the first authoritative\u00a0Dictionary of the English Language. Two long distance trails pass through the city so you can easily extend your walk. Heading north west along the Heart of England Way or the Two Saints Way will take you to the splendid Cannock Chase Country Park . Here you will find miles of great walking and cycling trails in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Heading south east takes you through the countryside to Kingsbury.",
