  "description": "This is a circular cycling and walking trail around the delightful Alwen Reservoir in Conwy, North Wales. \nYou will pass through forest plantations and up onto Mynydd Hiraethog where there are splendid views of the surrounding area. The route can be started at the car park at the south eastern end of the water at postcode\u00a0LL21 9TT. The route is decorated with six interpretation panels with information about local history, culture and folklore. Wildlife lovers should look out for curlew, the rare Black Grouse and Red Squirrels. The route is well way-marked with blue posts. To continue your reservoir walking in the area, just head east to the larger Llyn Brenig . You can follow an excellent circular trail around the water with more great views, woodland trails and the lovely heather moorland of the Denbigh Moors.",
