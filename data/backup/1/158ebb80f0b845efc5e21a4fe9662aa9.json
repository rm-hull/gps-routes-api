  "description": "This is a circular cycling and walking trail around the delightful Alwen Reservoir in Conwy, North Wales. You will pass through forest plantations and up onto Mynydd Hiraethog where there are splendid views of the surrounding area. The route can be started at the car park at the south eastern end of the water at postcode LL21 9TT. The route is decorated with six interpretation panels with information about local history, culture and folklore. Wildlife lovers should look out for curlew, the rare Black Grouse and Red Squirrels. The route is well way-marked with blue posts. To continue your reservoir walking in the area, just head east to the larger Llyn Brenig. You can follow an excellent circular trail around the water with more great views, woodland trails and the lovely heather moorland of the Denbigh Moors.",

Here you can go to the cafe where you can enjoy a meal from the balcony and enjoy fabulous views over the lake. They use fine Welsh produce for their meals and also have a lovely selection of cakes. The centre is located less than a mile north from the car park."
