This walk in the town takes you through Ammanford Park to Betws Park where there are some nice trails along the River Amman. The Amman Valley Route is a shared cycling and walking trail running from Pantyffynnon to Brynamman via Ammanford. The traffic free path runs along the river with some splendid views to enjoy on the way. Scroll down for a list of walks in the local area.",
