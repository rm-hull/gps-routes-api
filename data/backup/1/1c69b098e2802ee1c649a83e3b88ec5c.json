  "description": "This large area of common land near Bromyard is a great place for walkers. The area covers over 200 acres with lots of footpaths to follow to the common's lakes, streams and pockets of woodland. Look out for pretty bluebells in the spring and a variety of birdlife on your walk. There's also splendid views towards the Malvern Hills and the surrounding Worcestershire and Herefordshire countryside. You can enjoy refreshments in the common-side cafe or pub after your exercise. It's easy to extend your walk by heading to the Brockhampton Estate which is right next to the common. The 1,700 acre estate has lots of good walking trails, a lake, streams and woodland to explore. The Worcestershire Way runs through Knightwick, just to the east of the common. The path will take you south to Ravenshill Wood and the Suckley Hills. Head north and you can visit Woodbury Hill, the River Teme valley and Abberley .",
