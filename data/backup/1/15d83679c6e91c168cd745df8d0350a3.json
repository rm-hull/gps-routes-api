  "description": "This walk explores the area around Porth Iago on the Llyn Peninsula. It's a lovely place for a stroll with a beautiful sandy cove, an ancient hill fort, low grassy headlands and a nice cliff top path. Starting from the public car park at the site you can follow a section of the Llyn Coastal Path east to Porth Ferin where there's another secluded bay with clear blue waters. The beach below is reachable by scrambling down the dunes. To continue your walk head south along the coast path to Whistling Sands where there's another lovely beach. A little further on there's Aberdaron where you can climb to an excellent viewpoint at Mynydd Mawr. Heading north will take you towards Llangwnnadl and the beach at Penllech.",
