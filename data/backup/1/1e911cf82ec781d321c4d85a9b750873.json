  "description": "This short climb takes you to the top of Duncryne hill near Gartocharn in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The hill is known as the 'Dumpling ' and stands at a modest height of 465 ft (142 m) giving wonderful views towards Loch Lomond. You can park by the roadside on Duncryne Road where you will find a gate and a good footpath leading through woodland to the hill. You follow the path to the hill summit where you will find a triangulation point. From here there are fabulous views over the Loch, its islands and the surrounding mountains of Ben Lomond and The Cobbler .",
