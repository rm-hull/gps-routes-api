  "description": "This walk visits Robin Hood's Stride, a wonderful rock formation near Bakewell in Derbyshire. The walk starts from the free Cratcliffe Parking area just south of the site. The roadside parking area is located on the B5056 just west of Birchover . Head south down the road and then turn turn right to link up with the Limestone Way . You can follow this waymarked footpath north to visit the photogenic rocks and viewpoint. It's a popular spot for rock climbing and walking with the atmospheric site surrounded by some lovely countryside. Local legend says it is a spot where Robin Hood once stood to look out on his surroundings. On the way you'll also pass the Hermit's Cave and Cratcliff where there are more interesting rock formations. Just to the north there's the Bronze Age Nine Stones Close Stone Circle to visit if you have time.",
