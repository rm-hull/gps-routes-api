It has now been restored and is an important habitat for wildlife. The former towpath on the west bank of the canal is a footpath from Chichester city to Chichester Marina."

  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside stroll along the Chichester Canal on this easy walk in Sussex. The walk begins in the centre of Chichester (near the train station and cathedral) following the canal towpath to Chichester Marina and Birdham where there are some great boats to see. Although this is categorised as a walking route, cyclists can also enjoy the first section of the towpath from Chichester to Hunston. The canal is great for wildlife so keep your eyes peeled for birds such as moorhens, coots, heron, kingfisher, whitethroat, common sandpiper, spotted flycatcher and woodpecker. You may also see foxes, deer and dragonflies as you may your way along the path. You can turn it into a longer circular walk by heading north along the coastal path to Apuldram. To extend your walking in the area you could head south and enjoy a lovely coastal walk at the RSPB Pagham Harbour reserve. You could also visit the nearby Chidham Peninsula and enjoy great views of Chichester Harbour . In the city itself the Chichester Walls Walk is a great way of learning about the fascinating Roman history of the area.",
