  "description": "This walk visits the waterfalls at Middle Black Clough and Far Black Clough near Woodhead Reservoir in the Peak District. The clough and the waterfalls are a little of the beaten track and require good footwear as some of the paths are quite wet. It's a beautiful place with a number of water courses and particularly picturesque waterfalls to see. You can start the walk from the car park at the eastern end of the reservoir near to the Woodhead Tunnel. Follow the A road east before crossing to the south. You can then follow footpaths heading south east along the River Etherow before turning south to explore Middle Clough and the secluded waterfall. After admiring the falls you then retrace your steps towards the river before heading south east to explore Far Black Clough where there's more stunning scenery and interesting rock formations to see.",

The excellent viewpoint at Bleaklow is only a couple of miles to the south west as well. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
