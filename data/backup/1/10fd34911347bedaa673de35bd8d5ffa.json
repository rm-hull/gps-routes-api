  "description": "This pleasant area of North London is located close to the Hertfordshire border. It's a good place to start a walk with a local common, a nearby country park and waterside trails along two signifcant waterways. It is also easilty accessible with a large train station with regular trains into London or out to Welwyn Garden City. This walk from Hadley Wood visits some of the local highlights including Trent Country Park, Pymmes Brook Trail and Monken Hadley Common. The walk starts from the train station and heads south through the town to the Covert Way Nature Reserve, Sewits Hill, Newman's Hill and Monken Hadley Common. There's some nice trails here with good views from the elevated position of the common. At the western end you'll find Bournwell Hill while the pretty Beech Hill Lake and the Pymmes Brook sits at the eastern end. On the common you can pick up the London Loop and follow the waymarked trail east to visit the nearby Trent Country Park at Enfield Chase. The park is a great place for a walk with lovely Japanese Gardens and a picturesque lake. The route then retraces its steps back to the train station but you could take a detour along the Pymmes Brook Trail which heads south to Cockfosters and East Barnet .",
