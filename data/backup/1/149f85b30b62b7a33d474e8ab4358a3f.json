  "description": "This popular sea side resort sits in a lovely spot on the edge of St Bride's Bay in Pembrokeshire. There's a lovely beach with natural arches and access to a fine cliff top path for walkers to enjoy. There's also a great beach front bar/cafe for rest and refreshment after your exercise. This walk from the village follows a section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to Druidston Haven and an Nolton Haven. The walk starts at the car park at Little Haven and follows the waymarked footpath north along Broad Haven beach. You then pass along the cliff top at Haroldston Bridge and Settlers Nose before continuing to the beach at Druidston. Here you will also find the Druidston Hotel which sits in a fine location above St Brides Bay. It's a nice place to stop for a drink with 20 acres of grounds to admire. From here you continue north past a series of natural arches before finishing at Nolton Haven. There's a picturesque and secluded cove to be found here.",

      "content": "The Little Haven Walk starts from the same car park. The walk will take you to the nearby St Brides Haven where you'll find a delightful secluded beach, rock pools and the 19th-century St Brides Castle. If you continue south along the coast path you could also pay a visit to Skomer Island. You can visit the island from April to October by catching a boat from Martin's Haven near Marloes Sands. The island is great for bird watching with thousands of breeding seabirds to see. Head north and you can visit the beautiful Solva Harbour and pick up the popular Solva to Newgale Walk and the Solva to St Davids Coastal Walk. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pembrokeshire Coast Walks page."
