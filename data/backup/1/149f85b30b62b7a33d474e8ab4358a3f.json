  "description": "This popular sea side resort sits in a lovely spot on the edge of St Bride's Bay\u00a0in Pembrokeshire. There's a lovely beach with natural arches and access to a fine cliff top path for walkers to enjoy. There's also a great beach front bar/cafe for rest and refreshment after your exercise. This walk from the village follows a section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to Druidston Haven and an Nolton Haven. The walk starts at the car park at Little Haven and follows the waymarked footpath north along Broad Haven beach. You then pass along the cliff top at Haroldston Bridge and Settlers Nose before continuing to the beach at Druidston. Here you will also find the Druidston Hotel which sits in a fine location above St Brides Bay. It's a nice place to stop for a drink with 20 acres of grounds to admire. From here you continue north past a series of natural arches before finishing at Nolton Haven. There's a picturesque and secluded cove to be found here.",
