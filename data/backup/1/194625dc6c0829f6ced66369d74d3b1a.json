  "description": "This circular walk is one of the most popular in the Peak District and a favourite for many. It runs along an elevated rocky ridge, with fascinating rock formations and wonderful views of the surrounding countrsyide and the nearby Tittesworth Reservoir . Ridge walking is always a joy but this one is something special. Highlights include a series of weathered gritstone boulders and the mystical Doxy Pool.  The pool is said to be inhabited by a malicious water spirit which drags victims into the depths. The area is also great for unusual wildlife. In the 1930s five Australian\u00a0Bennett's wallabies\u00a0were released into the wild from a private collection.\u00a0A small colony is believed to continue to live around the area with occasional sightings. The circular walk starts from the roadside parking area on Roach Road (ST13 8UA). You will see a gate and information board on the eastern side of the road where you can pick up the nice path up to the ridge. The path runs north past the Doxy Pool to the high point on the ridge at 505\u00a0m (1,657\u00a0ft). You descend to Bearstone Rock where you turn south and follow the Roach Road back to the car park. If you'd like to continue you walking in the area then you can head to the southern end of the escarpment and enjoy a climb to the distinctive Hen Cloud . There is also a super circular route around Tittesworth Reservoir just over a mile from the start of the Roaches walk. Just off the northern top of this route you will find the fascinating deep rocky chasm of Lud's Church . The geologically fascinating area is well worth a short detour if you have time. Also nearby is the wonderful Three Shires Head where the counties of Cheshire,\u00a0Derbyshire and\u00a0Staffordshire\u00a0meet. The area includes a series of pretty waterfalls on the River Dane.",
