      "content": "In Pocklington we recommend a walk along the Pocklington Canal and a visit to the very pretty Burnby Hall Gardens. It's a lovely place for an afternoon stroll with landscaped gardens and two lakes. The park is notable for over 100 types of water lilies displayed in the lakes where you can also feed the fish. There's also an ornamental bridge, a Victorian Garden, an Aviary Garden, a newly restored Edwardian Rock Garden, a Stumpery, and a Birch Walk, the latter being the most recent horticultural addition. You can find out about the history of the area in the Stewart Museum. It houses a fascinating collection of artefacts collected by Major Stewart on eight world tours that were undertaken between 1906 and 1926, several of which have been deemed by UNESCO as being of national and international importance. Afterwards visit the cafe where you can enjoy refreshments with a view. You can find the park in the town centre with a postcode of YO42 2QF for your sat navs.  Burnby Hall - Victorian Gardens and Dragonfly Pond"
