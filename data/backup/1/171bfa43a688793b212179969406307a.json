  "description": "This circular walk visits the beautiful Hindhope Linn and Blakehopeburnhaugh Waterfalls in Kielder Forest. The walk starts from the Blakehopeburnhaugh car park to the east of the falls. From here you can pick up woodland trails heading west along Forest Drive. Other tracks will lead you down to the falls on the Blakehope Burn. It's a lovely secluded spot with the rushing falls in a photogenic dell. You can continue west to Blackblakehope before following alternative paths back to the car park.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area head north west through the Redesdale Forest to visit Catcleugh Reservoir. There's lots of wildlife and some nice waterside trails to enjoy here. The epic Pennine Way runs right past the car park so you can easily pick up this long distance waymarked footpath to continue your walk. On the southern side of the forest you can explore Wark Forest. It's a very peaceful area with miles of good walking and mountain bike trails. There's a car park at the Stonehaugh Picnic and campsite where you can pick up some nice walks along the Blacka Burn. Just to north east you can explore the expansive Otterburn Ranges around Byrness. There's miles of walking trails taking you to the source of the River Coquet on the border with Scotland. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northumberland National Park Walks page."
