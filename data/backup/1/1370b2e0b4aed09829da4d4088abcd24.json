When first erected here, over 100 years ago, the male figures were above the female ones. They have been like this since the early 1980's."

  "description": "This Norfolk based village is located in a lovely spot near to the coast and the delightful neighbouring village of Burnham Overy Staithe. The village is very picturesque with a village green, traditional shops and two noteworthy old churches. The area also has strong links with Horatio Nelson who was born nearby. His father Edmund was also rector of both village churches in the 1760s and 1770s. This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the area including Burnham Overy Staithe, Holkham Beach Nature Reserve, Holkham Park and Nelson's Birthplace at Burnham Thorpe. The walk starts in Burnham Market and follows country lanes north east to Burnham Overy Town and then up to Burnham Overy Staithe. Here you can pick up the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path and follow it east through the Holkham Nature Reserve to Holkham Meals. It's a lovely stretch of coast with an expansive National Trust beach, sand dunes and lagoons. At Holkham Meals you can pick up Lady Ann's Drive and follow it south into Holkham Park. The large park includes Holkham Hall, woodland, a deer park and a large picturesque lake. After exploring the park the walk heads west to visit Burnham Thorpe. Here you'll find the birthplace of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson, victor at the Battle of Trafalgar. The house in which Nelson was born was demolished soon after his father's death, though the rectory that replaced it and the church at which his father preached can still be seen. The site of the former rectory is marked by a roadside plaque. After exploring the village the route follows a country lane back into Burnham Market.",

The building has an interesting history dating back to 1685 when it was originally called \u2018The Mermaid\u2019. Horatio Nelson\u2019s father was present when The Mermaid was renamed in tribute as \u2018The Admiral Nelson\u2019 in 1805, directly after the Battle of Trafalgar. They have a good menu with a bar area and a restaurant. There's a charming interior with local artwork available for sale. There's also an outdoor area for warmer days.  You can find them on Creake Road with a postcode of PE31 8EN for your sat navs."

      "content": "Just to the north of the village you'll find the noteworthy Church of St Margaret, in Burnham Norton. The church is well worth seeing as it includes an 11th century Saxon round-tower. The Grade I listed building also retains an elaborately decorated 15th-century pulpit, considered one of the finest surviving examples of its type. If you continue east along the coast path you can visit the neighbouring town of Wells-Next-the Sea. Here you can try the Wells-Next-the-Sea to Blakeney Walk and visit the wonderful Blakeney Point Nature Reserve. If you head west you can visit Brancaster and the Titchwell Nature Reserve where there are more wildlife watching opportunities. Head south east to Great Walsingham and you could pick up the Walsingham Way. This long distance trail runs from the mediaeval abbey at Great Walsingham to the city of Norwich, passing several fascinating historic sites on the way. The abbey in Walsingham is one of the highlights of the area and well worth a visit. There's some lovely grounds with the snowdrop and bluebell walks particularly popular. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Walks page."
