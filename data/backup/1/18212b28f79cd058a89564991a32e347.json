Eventually the arch will collapse, leaving a pillar (stack) of chalk cut off from the rest of the headland. The beach shingle is predominantly of local flint and chalk, but there are numerous erratic rocks and pebbles released from the boulder clay (which overlies the Chalk) which has fallen/slipped on to the beach and been broken up by the sea. Large boulders of various types are also scattered over the beach."

  "description": "This pretty bay on the North Yorkshire Coast is located on the North Yorkshire Coast just north west of Flamborough Head . It has good facilities with a car park and the wonderfully positioned Thornwick Bay cafe which has great views out to sea. This walk follows the coast path west to Bempton Cliffs , one of the premier birdwatching sites in the country. Start the walk from the car park at the bay and then head west along the coast path. You'll pass the striking rock formation at Thornwick Nab, with its arch cut into the Chalk, jutting out to sea. Soon you will come to Bempton Cliffs where you can see hundreds of Puffins, Gannets, Kittiwakes, Guillemots and Razorbills. Atfer retracing your steps you can enjoy refreshments at the cliff top cafe where the speciality is locally caught crab. To continue your walking in the area head to the nearby Dane's Dyke . These pretty woods have peaceful trails with lots of flora and fauna to look out for. The East Riding Heritage Way long distance footpaths also passes the site. The waymarked trail can easily be picked up to explore the area.",
