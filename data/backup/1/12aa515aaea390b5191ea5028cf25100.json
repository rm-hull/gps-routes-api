Though only scant remains of Dunoon Castle exist today, its hilltop position offers stunning views over the town of Dunoon and the Firth of Clyde. Originally built in the 12th century, the castle was a significant stronghold and even served as a royal residence during the 14th century. The original structure is believed to have consisted of three circular towers arranged in a triangular formation. However, little of the castle remains today, as it was abandoned in the 17th century following an invasion. The stones from the ruined castle were later quarried in the 19th century to construct Castle House, a building that still stands today. Dunoon Castle's historical significance and its picturesque location make it a site of interest despite the loss of most of its original structure."

  "description": "Dunoon is a fine coastal town located on the Cowal Peninsula in the south of Argyll and Bute. This walk from the town takes you up to the viewpoint at Bishop's Seat. Starting from the car park on the western edge of the town you can follow paths west into the delightful Bishop's Glen. Here you will find some peaceful woodland trails and a pretty reservoir. After coming out of the woods you will come to the peak of Eilligan which stands at 463 metres. Head west from here and you will come to Bishop's Seat at 512 metres. There is a trig point here and some wonderful views over the surrounding mountains. To extend the walk head to Dunoon Castle where you can see the ancient ruins and enjoy more great views over the Firth of Clyde.
