The listed cottage was due for demolition due to the extension of Stansted airport. In 1987 it was dismantled and rebuilt as it was in the late 17th century on the country park in Pitsea. It is once again a listed building. A Kiddies adventure playground is in the background."

  "description": "Explore 125 acres of parkland in the beautiful Essex Marshes near Basildon. Attractions include a miniature railway and a model boating lake. The scenery includes grazing meadows, ancient hedgerows, blast mounds, tidal waterways, sea walls and field boundaries. The park is perfect for birdwatching with a huge number of water loving birds visiting the marshes all year round. To continue your exercise in the area you could head west and visit Langdon Hills Country Park where there are more good cycling and walking trails. There's also trails across the Vange Marshes to the west and the Bower Marshes to the east. These run along the East Haven Creek to South Benfleet.",
