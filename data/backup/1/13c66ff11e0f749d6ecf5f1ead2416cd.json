  "description": "This walk explores Brighstone Forest and Brighstone Down on the Isle of Wight. You can start the walk from the Jubilee Car Park on Lynch Lane with a postcode of PO30 4AZ for your sat navs. From here you can pick up a section of the Worsley Trail and follow it east to climb to Limerstone Down. There's an excellent viewpoint here with a toposcope detailing the landmarks you can see from the hill top. After enjoying the views you then then turn north west to enter the forest where you can follow trails up to Brighstone Down which stands at a height of 214 metres. There's more nice views to the coast from this elevated spot. The route then follows woodland trails west to Calbourne Bottom and the car park.",

To continue your woodland walking on the island head to Newport where you can visit the expansive Parkhurst Forest. The forest is the second largest area of woodland on the island (behind Brighstone). It's notable for its wildlife which includes the ever popular red squirrel. Just south of the forest there's the National Trust's Mottistone Manor. There's beautiful gardens and bluebell woods to explore in the grounds surrounding this historic Elizabethan manor house. For more walking ideas in the area see the Isle of Wight Walks page."
