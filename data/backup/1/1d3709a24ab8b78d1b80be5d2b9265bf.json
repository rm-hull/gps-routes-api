  "description": "This is a super circular walk around the village of Newtonmore in the Cairngorms National Park. The 10km route is fairly easy with little climbing and is waymarked throughout with a wildcat symbol. There are lovely waterside sections along the great River Spey and River Calder. You will also pass a splendid gorge and a waterfall with magnificent views of the Cairngorm & Monadhliath Mountains for the duration of the walk.",
