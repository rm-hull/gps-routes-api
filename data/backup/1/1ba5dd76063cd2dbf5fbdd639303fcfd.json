  "description": "This shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line from Achill to Westport in County Mayo. The popular route covers a distance of 42 kilometres (26 miles), passing through the towns of Newport and Mulranny. Along the way there are some excellent views over Clew Bay, Clare Island, Croagh Patrick mountain and the Nephin Beg Mountains. You'll also pass Castlebar where there's a lovely waterside circular trail around Lough Lannagh. The trail follows the route of the Achill extension of the Westport railway line, which was constructed in the 1890s and closed in 1937.",

The popular circular walk explores a wonderful coastal headland with lots of seabirds and fabulous views. In nearby Bangor Erris there's the trail head of the Bangor Trail. The challenging long distance hike exposes you to the remote and mountainous scenery of the Wild Nephin National Park."
