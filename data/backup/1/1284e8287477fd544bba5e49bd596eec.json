  "description": "Enjoy a walk along tree lined paths in this delightful park in Scarborough. The park has nice surfaced footpaths leading you to a pretty lake and gardens with an oriental theme. There's lovely little bridges over the water and a splendid Chinese Pagoda. Just across the road you can continue the walk into Royal Albert Park which leads to the North Sands beach. Just beyond there you will find Scarborough Castle which dates from the 1150s. The coastal path runs around the castle to the harbour with wonderful views over North and South Bay. To extend your walk you can pick up the Cleveland Way on the coast and try the Scarborough to Filey Walk .",
