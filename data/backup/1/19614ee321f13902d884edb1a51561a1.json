The origin of the name 'Ae' is unknown, but it is listed in the Guinness book of records as the shortest British village name."

  "description": "This route explores the Ae Forest in Dumfries and Galloway. The expansive forest has miles of walking and mountain bike trails to try. You can start from the Ae Forest car park located near Ae village at the southern end of the woods. Then head north into the forest where you can enjoy views of the Water of Ae. On the north western side of the forest you can visit the pretty Loch Ettrick and the Crichope Linn waterfall. You can see the mountain bike trails marked in blue and brown on the open street map below. The video below gives an example of some of the red and black trails you can find at the site.",

The castle is surrounded by extensive grounds with several waymarked walking paths and some challenging mountain bike trails to try. The long distance Romans and Reivers Route starts in the forest. This 52 mile route follows the old Roman Roads to Hawick in the Scottish Borders. Following the trail north east will take you to Moffat where you can enjoy a riverside walk along the River Annan on the Annadale Way. To the south east there's Lochmaben where you can enjoy a lovely circular trail around Castle Loch. There's also the remains of the 12th century Lochmaben Castle to see here. The Caledonian Cycleway passes through the forest. The waymarked route runs from Dumfries to Beattock near Moffat."
