      "caption": "Bluebells in Corbar Woods. The woods are the oldest woodland in Buxton and part of Buxton's \"The Park\" conservation area. The 54 acres are owned and managed by the Buxton Civic Association. In medieval times, the woods were used for coppicing trees. Remains of a white coal pit can be found, where dried coppice branches were used to generate the high temperatures required to smelt lead. The 19th-century paths through these ancient woods, known as the Victorian Swiss Walks, were designed by Joseph Paxton, who also designed the original Buxton Pavilion Gardens. These paths allowed visitors to the spa town to enjoy views of Buxton\u2019s fine buildings from the hilltop. The \"Ring of Trees\" waymarked walk around Buxton runs through Corbar Wood. The main tree species are beech, yew, and oak. Each May, the woodland floor at the higher west end is covered with bluebells. The woods are home to common birds such as thrushes, tits, and finches, as well as nuthatches and woodpeckers. Corbar Hill House, situated on Corbar Road in Buxton, is a Grade II listed building. Constructed in the 19th century in the style of a French ch\u00e2teau with a mansard roof and fountain, it was originally built for the Ryder family. It later became the John Duncan School, which closed in 2003, and has since been converted into private apartments. Corbar Hill Hydro was converted from the Clarendon guest house in the 1890s to offer hydropathic treatments and was sold in the 1930s to serve as accommodation for nurses."

      "caption": "Old Quarry in Corbar Wood. Nithen Quarry on Corbar Hill supplied high-quality sandstone for many years for the buildings of Buxton, including the town hall, which was built in the 1890s. The hill is located at the southern end of Combs Moss. The summit, identified by a trig pillar, is 437 metres (1,434 feet) above sea level. The north-west side of the hill, along with much of Combs Moss and Black Edge, is designated as \"open access\" land for the public, following the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Corbar Cross was a gift from the Duke of Devonshire to Buxton\u2019s Catholic community, erected at the summit in 1950 to mark the Holy Year declared by Pope Pius XII. In the 1990s, the cross was painted pink as a prank, and in 2010, it was cut down by protesters against Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the UK. A replacement, a 6-metre-high (20-foot) solid oak cross, was donated by a firm in Lancashire and installed in 2011."
