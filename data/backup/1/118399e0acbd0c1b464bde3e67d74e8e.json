  "description": "Enjoy a walk from West Bay to Abbotsbury on the Dorset coast. The route runs for a distance of 9 miles along a lovely section of the South West Coast Path. You can start the walk from the car park on the sea front in West Bay. From here you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it south east past the Bridport and West Dorset golf club to Burton Bradstock. The walk then heads along Burton Beach and Cogden Beach where you will pass the pretty Burton Mere and the West Bexington Nature reserve where you can look out for a variety of coastal wildlife. The final section leaves the coast, passing the delightful Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens and the historic Abbotsbury Castle before finishing in the village. You can extend the walk by continuing along Chesil Beach towards Weymouth.",
