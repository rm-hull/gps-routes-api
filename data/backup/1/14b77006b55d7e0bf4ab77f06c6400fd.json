  "description": "This walk from the Hampshire village of Hartley Wintney explores the area to the south of the settlement. You'll visit some of the highlights of the area including the Basingstoke Canal and Dogmersfield Park . The walk starts in the village and heads south through the centre of the village. Eventually you come out into the countryside where you can pick up the Three Castles Path and follow the waymarked footpath south. It will take you past Taplin's Farm, Cranford's Farm and Blacklands Copse to the canal. Here you can follow the towpath towards Sandy Hill Bridge where you turn east to enter Dogmersfield Park. There's a nice waterside path to follow a waterside footpath along the Tundry Pond before rejoining the canal to make a pleasant circular loop in the park. After passing Barley Mow Bridge you pick up the Three Castles Path again and follow it north back into Hartley Wintney.",
