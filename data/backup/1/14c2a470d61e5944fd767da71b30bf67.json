  "description": "These peaceful woods in East Lothian have some nice trails and good bird watching opportunities. Look out for Jays, Great Spotted Woodpeckers and Nuthatches on your walk. You may also see otters in the pond or the pretty burn that runs through the woods. Other features include a number of lovely circular clearings and several small car parks around the perimeter. The site is located close to John Muir Country Park which is a great place to extend your walk. In the park there's lovely beaches and a wide variety of plantlife and birdlife to look out for.",
