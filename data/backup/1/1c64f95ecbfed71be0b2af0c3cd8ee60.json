  "description": "A circular walk around the North Yorkshire town of Masham , visiting a series of stone sculptures. The route runs for just over 3 miles and includes riverside sections along the River Ure and River Burn. There's also some fine countryside views as you make your way around this popular little town. On the way look out for the six 'Leaves', interesting limestone sculptures that were reclaimed from the town's former railway platform. The walk starts from the Market Square and heads to Masham Primary School where you will see the first sculpture. You continue to St Mary's Church where there's 'The Standing Tree' sculpture in the churchyard. You then head towards the river on the Ripon Rowel following the trail round to Low Burn Bridge, passing another scupture on the way. The route crosses the River Burn passing Burn Holme and Dykes Hill before turning east to return to the town centre.",
