  "description": "This circular walk in Neath visits the lovely Aberdulais waterfall and explores the woodland trails in Craig Gwladys Country Park. Along the way there are splendid views of the River Neath Valley and a nice waterside stroll along the Tennant Canal. The walk starts at the car park just a short stroll from the falls. It's a lovely area with the rushing water of the River Dulais surrounded by cliffs and vegetation. The falls are also home to Europe's largest electricity-generating water wheel. Aberdulais has a fascinating history as power has been drawn from the waterfall since the late 16th century. It first provided energy used in the manufacture of copper and later corn-milling and tin. After leaving the falls the walk continues through the mixed woodland of Craig Gwladys Country Park. The park is fabulous for wildlife spotting with butterflies, green woodpeckers, owls, buzzards and herons to look out for. At Cadoxton you pick up the Tennant Canal and follow the towpath along the water back to the car park. It's a nice stretch of canal with little stone bridges, waterside cottages and old churches. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could visit the nearby Gnoll Estate Country Park. Here you will find  240 acres of woodland and wide open spaces with miles of walking trails to try. You could also continue along the Neath Canal. Our Neath Waterfalls Walk starts in nearby Pontneddfechan. It explores Waterfall Country visiting the spectacular Four Waterfalls Walk .",
