  "description": "This delightful local nature reserve in Bude is a great escape from the busy seaside town centre. You can enjoy a stroll along the Bude Canal tow path with views of the River Neet. An off road National Cycle Network route runs along the opposite side. Habitats in the reserve include reed bed, wet grassland, woodland and willow carr.\u00a0You can look out for a variety of birds from the bird hide, while otters can also been seen around the canal and river. At the southern end of the canal you can take a small detour to visit Marhamchurch where there's a noteworthy 14th century church to see. The circular walk from the village uses the shared cycle path running through the River Neet valley.",
