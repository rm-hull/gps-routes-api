  "description": "This delightful local nature reserve in Bude is a great escape from the busy seaside town centre. You can enjoy a stroll along the Bude Canal tow path with views of the River Neet. An off road National Cycle Network route runs along the opposite side. Habitats in the reserve include reed bed, wet grassland, woodland and willow carr. You can look out for a variety of birds from the bird hide, while otters can also been seen around the canal and river. At the southern end of the canal you can take a small detour to visit Marhamchurch where there's a noteworthy 14th century church to see. The circular walk from the village uses the shared cycle path running through the River Neet valley.",

      "content": "Head north along the coast path and you will soon come to Morwenstow. This lovely area is run by the National Trust and includes some fine cliff top trails. It's also historically significant with a thousand year old church, a 14th century farm and the noteworthy Hawker's Hut. This unusual structure sits in a photogenic spot and was built using driftwood by local vicar and poet Rev. Robert Stephen Hawker. Near here you can also visit the beautiful Hartland Quay. If you follow the coast path south for a few miles you can pick up the circular Crackington Haven Walk. It's another popular local area for walking with fine cliff top views and a nice beach. There's good facilities too with a car park and a beach-side pub with sea views. The walk also includes a visit to the historic Norman church at the little hamlet of St Gennys. You can also pick up the Boscastle to Crackington Haven Walk here. This takes you south to Boscastle, passing High Cliff, the highest point on the Cornish coast on the way. The Bude to Sandymouth Circular Walk starts from the Summerleaze Beach car park and takes you to Sandy Mouth where you'll find a lovely National Trust beach, waterfalls and a nice cafe for refreshments."
