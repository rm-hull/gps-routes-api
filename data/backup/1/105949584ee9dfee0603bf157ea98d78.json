  "description": "This is a fairly hilly circular route taking you through some of the most peaceful and attractive countryside in Somerset. The walk starts and finishes in the pretty village of Chew Magna and follows the path to Pensford and then back via Clutton. You will climb Knowle Hill, Maes Knoll, and Blackberry Hill (three peaks) while enjoying excellent views of the Mendip Hills, Dundry Hill and the surrounding Chew Valley countryside. The route also passes very close to the popular Chew Valley Lake where you will find a lovely nature trail on the eastern shores. The trail is well surfaced and offers great views across the lake towards Denny Island, a nesting site for Great Crested Grebe, Tufted Duck and Canada Geese. Near here you will also pass the pretty village of Pensford and the impressive Grade II listed Pensford Viaduct .",
