It is not taken with a zoom lens but it is cropped from the original photograph. The monument includes a prehistoric standing stone with a medieval cross incised on it, situated in the churchyard at Mabe in west Cornwall. The stone, which is listed Grade II, is 1.85m high and 0.66m wide at the base tapering to 0.35m at the top. The principal faces are orientated north-south, and on the top of the north face is a small incised `Latin' cross, probably added at sometime during the medieval period. On the east face the granite has naturally weathered along linear cracks, which has given the misleading impression that there is a further inscription or incised ornament on this stone. The standing stone is set in a low mound and is considered to be in its original location."

  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Argal Reservoir near Penryn and Falmouth in Cornwall. It's a lovely place for a walk with fine views across the water to the surrounding Cornish countryside. You can follow a 2 mile circular walk around the water, crossing the dam on the way. The walk can be started from the car park at the northern end of the lake near the dam and on site cafe. Then pick up the trails heading south towards Treverva. On the western side you will pass close to the noteworthy Mabe church where there's an ancient cross and standing stone to see in the churchyard.",

Head east and you could pick up the Falmouth Walk and visit Pendennis Point, Pendennis Castle and the pretty Swanpool lake nature reserve. Also to the east is the Penryn Walk which will take you along the Penryn River to Flushing where you can catch a ferry to Falmouth. The town itself is also worth exploring with a historic conservation area where you'll find a number of Tudor, Jacobean and Georgian properties. The pretty harbour and wharf also includes a fine riverside cafe. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
