  "description": "This North Yorkshire village is located just to the south west of Harrogate. Huby is accessible by Weeton railway station on the line which links Leeds with Harrogate. During Monday to Saturday daytimes, there is generally a half-hourly service southbound to Leeds and a half-hourly service northbound to Knaresborough with one train per hour onwards to York. This walk from the village follows pleasant country lanes to Almscliffe Crag . The crag is a fine local viewpoint with wonderful views over the surrounding countryside of the Wharfe Valley. Simply follow Merrybank Lane north and you will come to the crag. There's some nice views of the surrounding farmland from the lane. The village is not to be confused with Huby in the Hambleton District of the county.",
