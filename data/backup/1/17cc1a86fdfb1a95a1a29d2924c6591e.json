  "description": "This small East Sussex based village sits in a lovely spot in the River Cuckmere Valley. The village is located just south of Alfriston and includes some lovely riverside walks and fine local pub dating back to the 1600s. As such it's a fine place to start a walk around the surrounding countryside of the South Downs. This circular walk from the village uses a section of The South Downs Way and other local footpaths to explore the area to the east of the settlement. On the way you will visit neighbouring Alfrisotn, the Long Man of Wilmington hill figure, Lullington Heath, Charleston Manor and the Litlington White Horse which is located just to the south west of the village. The route starts with a riverside walk to nearby Alfriston before heading east to climb to the Long Man of Wilmington where there's the famous white hill figure and some wonderful views over the area. You then loop round to explore the Lullington Heath National Nature Reserve where there's a wide variety of interesting flora and fauna to see. Atfer passing through the reserve the route then passes Westdean and rejoins the river at Exceat Bridge. Follow the river north and you will soon come to the Litlington White Horse. The large chalk figure dates from the 19th century and provides some fine views from its elevated location.",
