  "description": "Explore the eastern end of Loch Earn and climb to a lovely viewpoint on this short walk. You can start the walk from the car park on the St Fillans Road just to the east of St Fillans. From here you can climb up to the viewpoint above the loch, passing through the woodland of St Fillans Park. There's splendid views over the beautiful loch to Ben Vorlich from this elevated spot. After taking in the views the route descends towards St Fillans before following the lochside road back to the car park. To continue your walking in the area head to the western end of the loch at Lochearnhead. Here you can pick up the trail to Glen Ogle. The shared cycling and walking route runs for about 8 miles along a traffic free path following the course of the former Callander and Oban Railway from Loch Tay at Killin to Loch Earn. Also to the west is Loch Voil where there's some lovely waterside trails to try. The epic Rob Roy Way also passes the loch. For an easy walk head east to the town of Crieff and try the delightful stroll through Lady Mary's Walk .",
