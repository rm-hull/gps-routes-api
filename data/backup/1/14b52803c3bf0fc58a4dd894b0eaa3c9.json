  "description": "This large forest near Bewdley has miles of super cycling and walking trails to enjoy. Cyclists can enjoy the family mountain bike trail which runs along nice wide paths through the woodland. There is also a section along a disused railway line and through a Nature Reserve. The trail is waymarked with blue markers. Bikes can be hired from Bewdley Outdoors. Walkers can enjoy three waymarked walking trails of varying lengths and difficulty. On the trails you'll pass through coniferous and deciduous forest and visit the lovely Wyre Arboretum. The circular route below starts near Button Oak and follows the cycle/walk trails through the forest to Dowles. Here you can return to the start point on country lanes if you are on a bike. If on foot you may prefer to return along the lovely waterside path along Dowles Brook which runs parallel to the dismantled railway line. Near the start of the route there's the Button Oak Meadow nature reserve where you'll find some pleasant woodland trails with lots of flora and fauna. Keep your eyes peeled for wildlife like deer, squirrels and various woodland birds as you make your way through this area.",
