  "description": "The market town of Leyburn has some lovely trails to follow through beautiful Wensleydale in North Yorkshire. This circular walk from the town visits the pretty little village of Wensley with a riverside section along the River Ure. There's lovely views of the surrounding Yorkshire Dales countryside and a nice country pub in Wensley to visit. Start the walk from Low Wood Lane just to the south west of the main parking areas in the town. Follow the lane south and it will lead you to the river. You can then pick up the riverside path heading west along the Ure to Wensley. The village gives its name to the dale Wensleydale and includes a Grade I listed church dating from 1300. There's also an attractive village green and rows of pretty stone cottages. You can stop for refreshments at the Three Horse Shoes pub where there are great views looking over lower Wensleydale from the beer garden. After exploring Wensley you can follow footpaths back through the countryside to Leyburn. To continue your walking in the Leyburn area, head south to Middleham where you can try our circular walk which visits Coverham Abbey, the River Cover and the atmospheric ruins of Middleham Castle. Just to the east you can visit the delightful Harmby Waterfall where there's a little trail along delightful falls. To the west there's the wonderful limestone escarpment at Leyburn Shawl where there's some fine views over the dales. You can also pick up the long distance Six Dales Trail in the village.",
