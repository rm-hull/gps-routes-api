  "description": "Visit the highest waterfall in Ireland on this short walk near Enniskerry, County Wicklow. The falls are located in a stunning valley surrounded by Djouce Mountain and the Great Sugar Loaf . The area has a good sized car park with paths leading down to a viewpoint close to the 121m (398ft) high falls. There are then a series of other nice trails to follow along the River Dargle and into the surrounding woodland of the Powerscourt Estate. Here you can see giant redwoods and look out for a variety of wildlife including Sikha Deer, Chaffinch, Cuckoo, Raven and the Willow Warbler. The site also has a kiosk serving food and drinks so you can easily refresh yourself after your exercise. For a longer walk try the circular Crone Woods Walk. This loop walk explores the peaceful woodland trails and streams to the north of the falls. It also climbs to 'Ride Rock', where there are fabulous views back down to the waterfall. You can virtually explore the area using the google street view link below! To continue your walking in the area head east to the coast and try the Bray to Greystones Walk. The wonderful cliff top route is one of the most popular walks in Ireland. Also nearby is the beautiful Lough Dan and the more challenging climb to Luggala. Both are located just a few miles south west of the falls.",

      "content": "Just to the south there's the expansive Ballinastoe Forest where there are miles of walking and mountain bike trails to try. The boardwalk trail will take you to the wonderful Luggala Estate View Point and the J B Malone Memorial. Malone was an Irish hill-walking enthusiast who popularised the pastime through his television programmes and books. From here you can also continue up to Djouce Mountain for some excellent views over the Wicklow Mountains. To the north west is the Lough Bray Loop Walk which takes you around two pretty lakes with more amazing views. The epic Wicklow Way passes through the area. You could pick up this waymarked trail to further explore the Wicklow Mountains."
