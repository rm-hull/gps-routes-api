  "description": "Enjoy a short walk around these beautiful gardens in Abbotsbury, Dorset. There are well laid out footpaths taking you through 30 acres of charming gardens with rare and exotic plants from all over the world. These include Camellia groves, Magnolias, Rhododendron and Hydrangea. Abbotsbury Gardens won the HHA/Christie's 2012 Garden of the year. Highlights in the gardens include a pretty sclulpture trail, woodland trails in the arboretum, tranquil ponds, a summer house and a viewpoint with great views of the south coast. The South West Coast Path runs past the gardens so you can pick this up to continue your walk to the nearby Chesil Beach or to the village of Abbotsbury. Also nearby is the Hardy Monument and the Iron Age Hillfort of Abbotsbury Castle where there are wonderful views over the Dorset coast and countryside.",

      "content": "Just a few miles to the south east there's the worthy village of Langton Herring to explore. The settlement includes a 17th century village pub and nice trails leading to the Moonfleet Manor Hotel. The coastal hotel is in a fine position with wonderful views to enjoy with your delicious afternoon tea. To the north there's Littlebredy which is something of a hidden gem. The delightful village includes the Little Bredy Walled Garden, a waterfall, a lake, an old church and footpaths along the River Bride which runs through the village. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dorset Walks page."
