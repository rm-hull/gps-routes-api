  "description": "Enjoy a short walk around these beautiful gardens in Abbotsbury , Dorset. There are well laid out footpaths taking you through 30 acres of charming gardens with rare and exotic plants from all over the world. These include Camellia groves, Magnolias, Rhododendron and Hydrangea. Abbotsbury Gardens won the HHA/Christie's 2012 Garden of the year. Highlights in the gardens include a pretty sclulpture trail, woodland trails in the arboretum,  tranquil ponds, a summer house and a viewpoint with great views of the south coast. The South West Coast Path runs past the gardens so you can pick this up to continue your walk to the nearby Chesil Beach or to the village of Abbotsbury. Also nearby is the Hardy Monument and the Iron Age Hillfort of Abbotsbury Castle where there are  wonderful views over the Dorset coast and countryside.",
