  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Walkerwood Reservoir in Stalybridge Country Park. It's easy walking with nice views of the Pennine Moors and the surrounding hills. There's a car park at the north western corner of the reservoir on Brushes Road where you could start the walk. From here you can pick up footpaths taking you around the water. The path runs for just over 1 mile, though you could extend the walk by following the Pennine Bridleway east to Brushes Reservoir and the Swineshaw Reservoirs. If you were to head south from the site you could visit a series of reservoirs running along the Longdendale Trail. The reservoir is also surrounded by some lovely Pennine Moorland with some good footpaths across Hollingworthall Moor to the south.",

Arnfield Reservoir is located just to the south east of the lake and has a nice walking trail to try. Our circular walk takes you along the eastern edge of the reservoir before visiting the woodland and lake in the nearby Hollingworth Nature Reserve. The long distance Tameside Trail passes just to the east of the reservoir. The 30 mile circular walk explores several of the highlights of the River Tame Valley. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
