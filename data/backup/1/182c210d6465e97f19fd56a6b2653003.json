  "description": "The popular village of Hayfield is a great base for exploring some of the highlights of the High Peak area of the Peak District National Park. It's proximity to Lantern Pike, Kinder Reservoir, Kinder Downfall and Kinder Scout are particularly attractive. There's also the Sett Valley Trail, Pennine Bridleway and Pennine Way long distance footpaths running through the area. This short walk takes you through the pretty village and then along the River Sett to Bowden Bridge. It's about 2 miles in length using paths on both sides of the water. On the southern side of the river you use a section of the Pennine Bridleway. You can follow it a little further south to visit Elle Bank where there are some splendid countryside views. To continue your riverside walking pick up the Sett Valley Trail and follow it in the other direction towards New Mills where you can visit the splendid Torrs Riverside Park and Millennium Way. It's a delighful spot with a beautiful river gorge and a 160 metre long walkway elevated over the waters of the River Goyt. Here you can also see the Torrs Hydro, a micro hydroelectric scheme which makes enough electricity to supply 70 homes.",
