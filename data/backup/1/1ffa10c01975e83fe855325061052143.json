  "description": "This circular walk visits the popular Sprotbrough Falls and the Sprotbrough Canal before heading to the nearby Sprotbrough Flash Nature Reserve on the River Don, near Doncaster. The area is popular with local walkers due to its natural beauty. It includes locks, weirs, woodland trails and lots of wildlife to look out for. The walk starts on Sprotbrough Bridge and heads past the falls to Sprotbrough Flash. The reserve is an interesting place located in the Don Gorge with some wonderful limestone scenery. The site also includes open water, wetland, woodland and limestone grassland. It's great for wildlife too with Bittern, Gadwall, Great Crested Grebe, Green Woodpecker, Reed Warbler and Brown Hare visitors to the area. In the summer months you will also see a wide variety of pretty wildflowers. After exploring the reserve you pick up riverside paths running along both sides of the Don. To extend your walking in the area you could pick up our Doncaster River Walk and head west along the river to Conisbrough and the impressive Conisbrough Viaduct. Near here you can also pick up the Trans Pennine Trail and visit the Denaby Ings Nature Reserve. It's another great place for wildlife watching and is located just a few miles west of Sprotbrough. The riverside walk forms part of the Don Valley Way, a long distance route which can be followed all the way to Sheffield.",

Here you'll find 500 acres of marsh, scrub, waterways, grassland and woodland with lots of wildlife to see as well. The peaceful woodland trails in Sandall Beat Wood on the eastern fringe of the town is another good option. To the east you can pick up the Peatlands Way to explore Thorne Moors and Hatfield Moors, part of the Humberhead Peatlands National Nature Reserve. The moors are the second largest lowland raised peat bog in England and notable for their diversity of wildlife and plantlife."
