  "description": "This walk explores Bagworth Heath Woods in the National Forest area of Leicestershire, near the town of Coalville. The park is located on the site of the former Desford Colliery and includes some pretty lakes, woodland trails and lots of wildlife. There's also a cycle track running through the centre of the site. You can start your walk from the car park at the southern end of the site, near to the fishing lakes. The National Forest Way passes through the heath. You could pick up this long distance trail and follow it east to visit the nearby Thornton Reservoir and Martinshaw Wood. Heading north west would take you to Sence Valley Forest Park .",
