  "description": "This hill to the north of Christchurch stands at 53-metres (174 ft). A climb to the top is rewarded with super views of the surrounding countryside and the River Avon with the coast and the Isle of Wight beyond. As well as the great views the area is covered with attractive heathland and coniferous forest to explore. There's also an abundance of wildlife with Dartford Warbler, Sand Lizard, Smooth Snake, Adder, Nightjar, Hobby, Grayling, Silver-studded Blue, Scarce Chaser and White-legged Damselfly to look out for. It's easy to extend your walk by picking up a footpath north to Town Common and Blackwater Hill where there are great views over the River Stour. Just beyond Blackwater Hill is the Sopley Common Nature Reserve. Here you'll find dry heathland, covered with purple heather, and a variety of wildlife including lizards & smooth snakes, heath grasshoppers, wood tiger beetle & grayling butterfly. All in all St Catherine's Hill and the area around it makes for a splendid long or short walk. To extend your walk you could visit Christchurch Harbour and Hengistbury Head where there are more great views of the area.",

Just beyond that is Hurn Forest where there are miles of good walking and cycling trails next to Bournemouth Airport."
