Haytor Quarries on Dartmoor were opened circa 1820 and a means of transporting the granite to New Quay, Teignmouth \u0096 whence it was shipped to the metropolis and used in the construction of London Bridge, now in Arizona \u0096 had to be devised. An 8.5 mile tramway was constructed from granite blocks quarried at Haytor, linking the quarries with the Stover Canal at Teigngrace. Barges then conveyed the cut granite to waiting vessels at Teignmouth. The tramway gauge was about four foot and the trucks, each carrying up to 3 tons, were horse drawn."

It's a great area for walking with miles of woodland paths to follow. The area is dominated by ancient\u00a0oak but there are other species such as\u00a0birch,\u00a0scots pine,\u00a0larch\u00a0and\u00a0beech. Other flora includes flowers such as cow-wheat and bilberry, and various Lichens and mosses. Look out for an abundance of wildlife including doormice and butterflies. Birdlife includes pied flycatcher, redstart, buzzards,\u00a0sparrow hawks and nightjars.This circular walk starts at the car park at the eastern end of the woods but you could also follow the Templer Way from nearby Bovey Tracey to reach the woods.",
