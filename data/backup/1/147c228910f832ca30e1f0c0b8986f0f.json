  "description": "This pretty Cumbrian village sits within the Arnside and Silverdale AONB, close to the border with Lancashire. This circular walk from the village takes you to the wonderful limestone scenery at the Fairy Steps. The steps are located just west of the village and reacheable on the Limestone Link public footpath. The natural limestone staircase is a popular geological feature of the area. The challenge is to climb to the top of the narrow stairs without touching the sides. From the elevated position of the ridge there are some great views towards the Lake District mountains and the nearby Arnside Knott. The trail will then take you through Underlaid Wood before picking up Dollywood Lane and Leighton Beck Road to return you to the village.",
