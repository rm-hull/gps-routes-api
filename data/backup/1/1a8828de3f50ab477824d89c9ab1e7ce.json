  "description": "This village is located in a lovely spot in the Derbyshire Dales area of the Peak District. It is notable as being on the border of the Peak District National Park which runs through the village west of the River Wye and immediately to the north of Chatsworth Road. Rowsley is also near the point where the River Wye flows into the River Derwent. The village is home to the Peak Shopping Village. There's a good range of stores with plenty of eateries for refreshment. At the time of writing a new nature reserve on the banks of the Derwent is being created by the shopping outlet and Derbyshire Wildlife Trust. This circular walk from the village visits Chatsworth Park, Bakewell and the historic Haddon Hall Park. The walk starts in the village and heads north along the Derwent Valley Heritage Way to Calton Lee and Chatsworth. This section runs along a waymarked footpath, running alongside the Derwent River. From Chatsworth you head west through the countryside to Edensor to Bakewell. At Bakewell you pick up a section of the Monsal Trail and follow it south towards Haddon Hall. The hall is another of the highlights of the area and located just a few miles west of the village on the River Wye. The hall dates from the 11th century with additions at various stages between the 13th and the 17th centuries. The fine stately home also includes a grand Tudor hall and Elizabethan gardens. From the hall the route finally heads east to return to Rowsley.",
