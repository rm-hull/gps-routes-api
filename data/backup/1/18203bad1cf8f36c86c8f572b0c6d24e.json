  "description": "This walk takes you along the Grand Union Canal from Berkhamsted to Tring and then on to Mawsworth. It's a very pretty section of the canal with a series of locks and nice views over the Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire countryside. The walk starts in the town centre near the train station and the pretty Canal Fields park. You can then follow the towpath north west past Northchurch Common on the Ashridge Estate. The common has some nice woodland walking trails and feeds into the pretty Berkhamsted Common. You continue towards Tring where you will pass the lovely Tring Reservoirs. The reservoirs are a great place to extend your walk with a series of waterside footpaths and lots of birdlife to look out for on the water. After passing round Marsworth Reservoir the walk finishes in the village of Marsworth. Here the canal splits of in two directions. If you head west you can follow the Aylesbury Canal to Aylesbury. Continuing north would take you into the Bedfordshire market town of Leighton Buzzard .",
