  "description": "This walk explores the large Neolithic settlement and henge enclosure of Durrington Walls near Amesbury, Wiltshire. You'll also visit the Neolithic Class II henge and timber circle of Woodhenge which is located nearby. You can start your walk from the Woodhenge car park. A short stroll takes you to 4500 year old Durrington Walls, the largest complete henge in Great Britain. After exploring the ancient site you can further explore the surrounding area on public footpaths. Just to south west you will find the Bronze Age burial mounds at King Barrow Ridge. This is a nice spot with ancient Beech trees and nice views across the area from the elevated position of the barrows. The walk then turns east towards Halfmoon Clump before following an old railway track towards Woodhenge. The walk can easily be extended to visit nearby Stonehenge by walking along the Stonehenge Avenue from Old Kings Barrows on the Woodhenge to Stonehenge Walk. You could also pick up the Salisbury Country Way which passes near to the site. The long distance circular footpath explores the countryside around Salisbury, visiting several pretty villages and interesting historical sites. There's also nice footpaths along the River Avon in nearby Amesbury. You could visit Amesbury Abbey and then follow the river south towards Normanton and Great Durnford. You can virtually explore the area around Woodhenge by clicking on the google street view link below.",

      "content": "There's lots of good options in nearby Amesbury and Durrington for refreshments but we'd recommend a trip down to the nearby village of Upper Woodford. Here you'll find the splendid Bridge Inn. The main attraction here is the lovely, large riverside garden area where you can relax and enjoy refreshments in an idyllic setting. Indoors there's a nice light country-style decor with sofas. They also have a very good menu and drinks selection. You can find the inn a couple of miles south of Stonehenge, in Upper Woodford, right next to the River Avon. Postcode for your sat navs is SP4 6NU."
