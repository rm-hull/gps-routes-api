  "description": "This fine city in central Scotland has some riverside trails, fine local parks, hill climbs and a wonderful castle to explore. The city is also close to the splendid Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park where there are numerous hill climbs and wonderful lochside trails to try. This walk takes you around Stirling Castle, visiting the Church of the Holy Rude and a fine viewpoint. The medieval castle buildings date from the 15th and 16th century. It sits on a hill top with wonderful views over the city and the River Forth. The castle and its grounds are a fine place for a walk with pretty gardens which include a lovely 200 year old beech tree. After exploring the castle head north east and enjoy a climb to the historic Wallace Monument .",
