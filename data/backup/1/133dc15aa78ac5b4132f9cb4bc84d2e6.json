  "description": "This walk explores the area around the delightful village of Spean Bridge in the Scottish Highlands. In the village walkers can enjoy pleasant trails along the River Spean and into the peaceful woodland of the Killiechonate Forest. There's also more challenging hikes into the surrounding Glen Spean. This circular walk from the village takes you up to the Commando Monument where there is a noteworthy memorial and a splendid viewpoint. Starting in the village you can follow a shared cycling and walking trail along a dismantled railway line north west. This will take you along the river through a wooded gorge to the ruins of Highbridge. This historic bridge was originally built by General Wade in 1736 as the crossing of the River Spean on his Inverness to Fort William military road. It was the site of the first action of the Jacobite rising of 1745. From here you follow footpaths east to the Commando Monument. The signficant memorial is dedicated to the men of the original British Commando Forces raised during World War II. From the elevated spot there are splendid views to the surrounding mountains including Ben Nevis and Aonach M\u00f2r. After taking in the views you can return to the village along the same paths or along the A82 road pavement. To continue your walking in the area head north west to pick up the Great Glen Way and the Caledonian Canal around nearby Gairlochy. On the Great Glen Way you can enjoy lovely cycling and walking trails along the nearby Loch Lochy .",

      "content": "The Old Station Restaurant is a fine place to enjoy some post walk refreshments in an historical setting. The restaurant is housed in a converted Victorian railway station on the world famous West Highland Line. It holds historical significance as it was the starting point for trainee Commandos during the Second World War. Their iconic training commenced with a memorable march from the station to Castle Commando. The West Highland Line is not only renowned for its military history but also for its association with the beloved Harry Potter movies. Moreover, the location is privileged to have the exclusive Royal Scotsman train make regular stops on the platform just outside the doorstep, particularly on Friday nights throughout the summer season. You can find them at postcode PH34 4EF for your sat navs."
