It was one of the earliest canals in England, dating from the 1600s. I can only imagine that it was once bigger or that the boats using it were not much more than rowing boats. It parallels the River Meon and gets it's water from it. There was a sea lock near the haven. The remains of which can still be seen."

  "description": "Explore this beautiful coastal nature reserve and enjoy a stroll along the Titchfield Canal on this circular walk near Fareham. The reserve boasts 369 acres of River, fen, pools, reedbed and meadow. These habitats attract a wide range of water loving wildlife. Look out for Reed Warblers, Bearded Tits, Water rails and Bittern around the reedbeds and Otters by the River Meon. There are a number of hides from which you can observe the wildlife. Other facilities include the Titchfield Haven Visitor Centre, tea room and exhibition about the history of the Solent area. This walk starts at the car park near Hillhead Harbour and takes you along the coast passing the Meon Shore chalets. You then turn inland and pass Bromwich Pond and some nice countryside before coming to the village of Titchfield. Here you could head north of the village and visit the interesting 13th century Titchfield Abbey. There are attractive grounds with ponds and major remains of the abbey to see. From Titchfield a waterside section along the Titchfield Canal and the River Meon takes you back to the car park. The Solent Way passes the reserve so you could pick this up to continue your walk. If you head south east you will come to Lee on Solent and Gosport. If you head west you will come to Southampton.",
