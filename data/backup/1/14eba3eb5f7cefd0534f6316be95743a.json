It was one of the earliest canals in England, dating from the 1600s. I can only imagine that it was once bigger or that the boats using it were not much more than rowing boats. It parallels the River Meon and gets it's water from it. There was a sea lock near the haven. The remains of which can still be seen."

  "description": "Explore this beautiful coastal nature reserve and enjoy a stroll along the Titchfield Canal on this circular walk near Fareham. The reserve boasts 369 acres of River, fen, pools, reedbed and meadow. These habitats attract a wide range of water loving wildlife. Look out for Reed Warblers, Bearded Tits, Water rails and Bittern around the reedbeds and Otters by the River Meon. There are a number of hides from which you can observe the wildlife. Other facilities include the Titchfield Haven Visitor Centre, tea room and exhibition about the history of the Solent area. This walk starts at the car park near Hillhead Harbour and takes you along the coast passing the Meon Shore chalets. You then turn inland and pass Bromwich Pond and some nice countryside before coming to the village of Titchfield. Here you could head north of the village and visit the interesting 13th century Titchfield Abbey. There are attractive grounds with ponds and major remains of the abbey to see. From Titchfield a waterside section along the Titchfield Canal and the River Meon takes you back to the car park. The Solent Way passes the reserve so you could pick this up to continue your walk. If you head south east you will come to Lee on Solent and Gosport. If you head west you will come to Southampton.",

In the visitor centre there's also interesting exhibitions of local artists work and nature photography.For some lovely sea views while you eat head to The Osborne View, just to the east of the reserve. It's the only remaining pub along Hill Head Beach front, with direct access to the shingle beach. Affording stunning views across the Solent (on a clear day of course!) the pub is named after Osborne House (residential home of HM Queen Victoria) on the Isle of Wight. With over 400 outside covers spanning a raised decked patio and large garden, together with a separate outside bar, it's the perfect place to enjoy a meal outside in the summer. You can find the pub on Hill Head Road with a postcode of PO14 3JP for your sat navs."

There's also a visit to Fort Nelson which has a fascinating military history. From the elevated position of the fort there are excellent views to the coast. The Warsash Walk starts from the nearby picturesque village and follows the River Hamble and the Solent Way to the reserve. It's about a 4 mile walk from the village with views over Southampton Water as you go.  Head east along the coast path and you will soon come to Alver Valley Country Park. The 500 acre park has some nice trails along the River Alver, another wildlife rich nature reserve, a cafe and cycle paths. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
