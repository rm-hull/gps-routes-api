      "caption": "Sarehole Mill, Hall Green, Birmingham. There has been a mill on this site since 1542. It has been rebuilt since that time and was used by Matthew Boulton for sheet metal rolling during the 18th century. It was also used for grinding tools, making gun barrels and finally as a flour mill. It is Birmingham's last surviving water mill, and flour making demonstrations are still held occasionally. It is open to the public free of charge and deserves a visit if you're ever in the area."

  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Sarehole Mill in Birmingham. There's nice trails to follow along the River Cole heading north from the mill to the Shire Country Park Great Mill Meadows. Heading south from the mill will take you along the river and the John Morris Jones Walkway towards Yardley Wood. The mill dates back to the 16 century and is notable as Birmingham's last surviving water mill. It's a nice place for a stroll with riverside trails and pretty weirs to enjoy. The area has strong connections to the author J.R.R Tolkien who was inspired by the local scenery when he lived near Sarehole Mill as a child. He has stated that he used the mill as a location in The Lord of the Rings, for the Mill at Hobbiton. To continue your walking along the River Cole in the city you could try the Cole Valley Walk which visits Kingfisher Country Park .",
