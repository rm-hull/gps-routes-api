  "description": "This large forest is located in the Suffolk Coasts and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the village of Dunwich. There are miles of peaceful woodland walking trails and lovely conservation areas of marshland and wetland adjacent to the woodland. This 5 mile circular walk starts at Dunwich village car park and takes you into the forest on the Suffolk Coast Path. You then follow a series of well defined trails through the coniferous and broadleaved woodland before returning to the village. At the northern end of the forest you will find the delightful Westwood Marshes and Walberswick Nature Reserve where there are excellent birdwatching opportunities. Also look out for the Dunwich ponies in the woodland area. If you follow the Suffolk Coast Path south you will soon come to the wonderful Minsmere Nature Reserve. This coastal nature reserve is considered one of the best sites in the country for birdwatching. Just to the south you'll find the lovely National Trust owned Dunwich Heath. There's miles of footpaths through beautiful purple heathland and coastal views along the pretty Dunwich beach. Also nearby is the pretty town of Southwold where you can try our circular walk around the town and along the River Blyth to Walberswick. The forest is also part of the Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve. It includes waymarked trails taking you to heathland, reed beds, grassland, woodlands, shingle, lagoons, mudflats and the salt marshes of the Blyth estuary.",
