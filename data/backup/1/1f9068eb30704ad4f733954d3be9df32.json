  "description": "This walk visits the 16th century Camber Castle in Rye, East Sussex. The historic site is located in the Rye Harbour Nature reserve just to the south of the town. You can follow a section of the Saxon Shore Way to the castle from Rye town centre. It's about a 1.5 mile walk along the waymarked trail passing through the Castle Water Nature Reserve on the way. There is a bird hide just east of the castle on the Castle Water Lake where you can look out for a variety of water loving wildlife. The ancient\u00a0Device Fort was built\u00a0by King\u00a0Henry VIII\u00a0to protect the\u00a0Sussex\u00a0coast of England against the increasing risk of a French attack in 1539. English Heritage provide guided tours if you would like to explore the interior of the fort and learn more about its history. You could continue your walking in the area by heading north east to Camber Sands where there is a popular beach.",
