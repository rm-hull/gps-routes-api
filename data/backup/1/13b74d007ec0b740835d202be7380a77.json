  "description": "This little village is located in a lovely spot in Thetford Forest next to the River Little Ouse. It's a very pretty area with a 12th century church, quaint cottages and some Forestry Commission offices based here. This circular walk takes you along a section of the Little Ouse Path to nearby Brandon in Thetford Forest. It then returns using part of the waymarked Hereward Way. The walk starts in the public car park in the village. From here it is a short stroll north to the river where you can pick up the waterside path. Follow it west and it will take you to Brandon where you cross the river to link up with the Herward Way. The path runs along the outskirts of Brandon before re-entering the forest where you can follow woodland paths back to Santon Downham.",
