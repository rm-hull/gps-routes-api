It was built to provide housing for workers employed at the nearby Speedwell and Ireland Collieries. Over time, as the need for more housing arose, new houses were constructed, which the locals refer to as the \"new village.\" The original houses, which were part of the initial construction, have since been demolished. This pattern of development is typical of many industrial villages in the UK, where housing was often provided by the company to ensure that workers lived close to their place of employment. The shift from old to new housing reflects changes in the needs and standards of living over the years."

  "description": "This 180 acre park consists of 85 acres of woodland, 42 acres of grassland and 23 acres of green water. There are several miles of well maintained paths suitable for cyclists or walkers. The park is located in Staveley, very near to Chesterfield and the village of Duckmanton. To extend your walk you can head north from the park and link up with the Chesterfield Canal. You could then follow a nice section of the canal into Chesterfield. The Cuckoo Way long distance trail also runs to the north of the park. Follow it north and you will come to Eckington's Renishaw Hall and Rother Valley Country Park .",
