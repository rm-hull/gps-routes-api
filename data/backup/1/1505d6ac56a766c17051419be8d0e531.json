There's nice footpaths and raised boardwalks to follow around this urban oasis where you can see horses grazing and a variety of birds around the water. There's also lots of interesting plants and a medieval packhorse bridge to see. You can start the walk from the car park at the northern end of the site, off Braunstone Lane East.",

Just to the south there's Everards Meadows where there's a popular cycle route and more nice walking trails. The site also includes a cafe and cycle hire centre. If you head east towards Oadby and Wigston there's a pleasant community orchard and pretty meadows to explore at Brocks Hill Country Park. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks page."
