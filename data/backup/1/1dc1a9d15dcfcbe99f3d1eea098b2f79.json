  "description": "This walk takes you along the old Horncastle Canal and the River Bain from the town centre of this Lincolnshire town. From here you can pick up the Viking Way, a waymarked footpath which will take you south along a section of the old canal. It originally ran for 11 miles from the River Witham at Dogdyke to Horncastle, through twelve locks largely following the course of River Bain. The canal opened in 1802, and was abandoned for navigation in 1889. This walk runs for the first couple of miles along the waterway, finishing near Martin. You could extend the walk by continuing south through Roughton to Haltham and Kirkby On Bain where there's a noteworthy 16th century pub and an ancient Norman church to see.",
