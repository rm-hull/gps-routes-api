  "description": "A popular coastal walk from Solva to St David's along a section of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path. The walk is just over 6 miles, taking place on undulating paths with wonderful sea views along the way. There is some climbing along the cliff tops but it is generally a fairly easy route. The walk starts from the beautiful Solva Harbour and south along the River Solva to the coast. You head west passing the stunning natural sea arch at Gewni Island and the interesting rock formations at The Cradle. You continue past Trelerw to Caerfai Bay where you will find purple sandstone cliffs and a sandy beach which can be reached at low tide on some steep steps. There's also tremendous views to the islands of Skomer and Skokholm from the picnic area above the beach. The next stage takes you to the St Non's Bay where you will find the ruins of St Non's Chapel, held by tradition to mark the birthplace of St David. The Grade II listed chapel is thought to be one of the oldest Christian buildings in Wales. Nearby you will find St Non's Cross and a holy well where visitors throw coins for luck. The route continues past the lovely Porthclais with its delightful harbour. The old harbour wall, built by the Romans is still largely intact. The walk then leaves the coast, following country lanes into St David's, where you finish at the cathedral. The city is noteworthy as the smallest in the UK and includes the medieval ruins of Bishops Palace next to the cathedral. The site dates back to the 6th century, although the building that stands today dates largely from the late 13th and 14th centuries. To extend your walking in the area head to the wonderful St David's Head where you can enjoy views of Ramsey Island and Carn Llidi, a huge jagged tor, towering above the coast. You could also try the Solva to Newgale Walk. This section of the path passes two impressive headlands with great views out to Green Scar Island and Ramsey Island.",
