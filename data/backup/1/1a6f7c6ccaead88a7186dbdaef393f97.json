  "description": "This small market town in South Somerset has some nice riverside trails and country trails through the lovely scenery of the Somerset Levels. A stroll around the town is also very interesting with a number of historic buildings. Of particular note is the Grade 1 listed Hanging Chapel, a 15th century structure with 12th century origins. The photogenic structure is well worth a visit as there are fine views from it's elevated position above the town. This circular walk from Langport takes you south along the River Parret to the historic Muchelney Abbey. The walk starts on the river in the town centre where you can pick up the River Parret Trail. Follow the waymarked trail east to Huish Bridge where you cross the river and head south. The trail will take you to Westover Bridge where you cross again and head east to Muchelney Abbey. The abbey is run by English Heritage who provide good facilities with a free car park, shop, vending maching and information boards. The abbey has a fascinating history having once been a wealthy Benedictine house and the second oldest religious foundation in Somerset. As part of the dissolution the abbey\u2019s principal buildings were demolished by Henry VIII in 1538. After exploring the abbey you can follow footpaths north along the river to Bicknell's Bridge where you cross and return in to Langport.",
