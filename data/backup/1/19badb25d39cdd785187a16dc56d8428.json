  "description": "This Befordshire based town has nice walks along the River Lea and is also close to the Chilterns Hills AONB where there are excellent walking opportunites. Other highlights include Wardown Park in the town, the nearby Luton Hoo Park and the popular Barton Hills National Nature Reserve. This circular walk from the town visits some of the highlights to the north using a few of the waymarked footpaths which run through the area. You'll use sections of the Lea Valley Walk , the John Bunyan Trail and the Icknield Way Path to visit Sharpenhoe Clappers and Barton Hills to the north of the town. On the way there's waterside sections along the River Lea and excellent views from the hill tops. The walk starts in the town centre just to the west of the train station. From here you can follow waymarked footpaths north along the River Lea through Wardown Park towards Limbury. Here you could take a small detour west from the route to visit the source of the river on Leagrave Common. This route continues north to Warden Hill and Galley Hill along the Icknield Way Path. You then pass Stonley Wood and the Hill fort at Ravensburgh Castle before coming to the Barton Hills Nature Reserve. There's lots of wildlife here and fine views to the Chiltern Hills from the elevated position of the reserve. The route then passes through the village of Barton le Clay before turning west to visit the Sharpenhoe Clappers. There's an Iron Age Hill Fort, a beech wood and more excellent views to enjoy here. The site is located just east of Toddington and Sundon Hills Country Park so you could take a slight detour from the route to visit this pretty park. The path then heads south along the John Bunyan Trail to the Smithcombe Valley and the village of Streatley. The trail leads you back into Luton where you pick up the river path again and follow it back towards the town centre.",
