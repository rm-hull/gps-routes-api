The popular and dramatic Gobbins Cliff Path can also be picked up in this area. To the south west there's the wonderful viewpoints at Cave Hill Country Park, Belfast Castle and Black Mountain to explore. To the north west there's Ballyboley Forest where you'll find more peaceful woodland trails and waterside walks along the Kilylane Reservoir. To the north there's the lovely Glenoe Waterfall to visit. The picturesque falls are located in the pretty village of Glenoe in County Antrim. It's a fine place for a walk with pleasant trails taking you through peaceful woodland to the 30ft high waterfall."
