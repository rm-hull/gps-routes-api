  "description": "This national nature reserve near Petworth has miles of nice footpaths to try. There's ancient woodland, streams, several ponds and lots of wildlife to look out for on the site. This circular walk starts from the car park at the northern end of the common, just off Streel's Lane and Church Path. At the south western end of the common you can extend the walk by heading across to Colhook Common where there are some pretty lakes. In the spring look out for the pretty bluebells in the woodland. On the meadows you can see early purple orchids, cowslips and primroses. It's great for wildlife spotting too. There's lots of different butterflies to see in the glades and birdlife including woodpeckers, whitethroats, blackcaps and turtle doves. To extend your walking in the area you could head south and visit the lovely Petworth Park. There's 700 acres of parkland and gardnes to explore here.",
