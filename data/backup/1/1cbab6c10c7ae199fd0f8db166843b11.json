  "description": "Visit the popular Blackpool Sands beach and enjoy a circular walk to Strete on this coastal route near Stoke Fleming. Blackpool Sands is located near Dartmouth and contains a beautiful beach, wooded cliffs and turquiose seas. It's a splendid place for a stroll along the beach before picking up the coast path and exploring the surrounding area. You can start the walk from the Blackpool Sands car park and then follow the South West Coast Path west to the village of Strete. At Strete you can stop for refreshments before following country lanes above the village. These lanes are in an elevated position with splendid views over the surrounding countryside and coast. They will lead you back to the finish point at the Blackpool Sands car park. To further explore the area you could head to the nearby Dart Estuary where you can visit the 14 century Dartmouth Castle and enjoy wonderful coast and river views.",
