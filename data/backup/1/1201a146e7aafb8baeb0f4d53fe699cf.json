The house and grounds passed out of the Londonderry family in 1987 when the estate was purchased by Sir John Hall."

  "description": "Formerly known as the Castle Eden Walkway Country Park this park in Billingham has numerous woodland footpaths and a visitor centre. National Cycle Network Route 1 also passes through the park so you can bring your bike too. Just north of the park is the Thorpe Wood Local Nature Reserve which offers a chance to extend your outing. There's also a delightful wildflower meadow, a fine cafe and a fascinating planetarium and observatory. The Castle Eden Walkway rail trail runs through the park so you can continue along this to Thorpe Wood and Brierley Wood. Also nearby is Billingham Beck Valley Country Park and Cowpen Bewley Woodland Park where there's pretty lakes and lots of birdlife to see. Near Stockton you can visit Coatham Woods with two waymarked woodland trails to try.",

They do very good food and also have two beer gardens where you can sit outside on warmer days. It's a welcoming place with a cosy atmosphere and is also dog friendly. You can find it on Stockton Rd with a postcode of TS27 4SD for your sat navs."

      "content": "A few miles to the north west of the park you will find the town of Sedgefield. The attractive town has a village feel with a fine medieval church and a number of 18th century houses surrounding a pretty green. The Sedgefield Walk will take you to the splendid Hardwick Hall Country Park before visiting the site of Bishop Middleham Castle and Castle Lake. The hall's beautiful grounds are one of the highlights of the area and the Castle Lake is a fine place for birdwatching, especially during the warmer months. Hurworth Burn Reservoir is located a few miles north of the park on the Castle Eden Walkway. It's a lovely place for a peaceful stroll with lots of wildlife to see and a good circular trail running around the perimeter. The Stockton on Tees Walk visits the Billingham Beck Valley Country Park on the north eastern side of the town. It's a nice place for a stroll with a visitor centre, wildflower meadows, reed-beds, ponds, marshland, woodland and lots of wildlife to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the County Durham Walks page."
