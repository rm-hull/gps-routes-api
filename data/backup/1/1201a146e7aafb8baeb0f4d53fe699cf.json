The hall is located just east of the park and is now a stunning hotel with beautiful grounds. There has been a country house on this site since the 12th century. The present house which was the seat of the Marquises of Londonderry was completed in 1846 and is widely considered to be one of the finest 19th century houses in Britain. The house and grounds passed out of the Londonderry family in 1987 when the estate was purchased by Sir John Hall."

  "description": "Formerly known as the Castle Eden Walkway Country Park this park in Billingham has numerous woodland footpaths and a visitor centre. National Cycle Network Route 1 also passes through the park so you can bring your bike too. Just north of the park is the Thorpe Wood Local Nature Reserve which offers a chance to extend your outing. There's also a delightful wildflower meadow, a fine cafe and a fascinating planetarium and observatory. The Castle Eden Walkway rail trail runs through the park so you can continue along this to Thorpe Wood and Brierley Wood. Also nearby is Billingham Beck Valley Country Park and Cowpen Bewley Woodland Park where there's pretty lakes and lots of birdlife to see. Near Stockton you can visit Coatham Woods with two waymarked woodland trails to try.",
