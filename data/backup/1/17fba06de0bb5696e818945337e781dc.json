  "description": "This small village is located on the Dengie peninsula in Essex. There's some good trails along the Blackwater Estuary and a significant holy site to visit in the area. This circular walk from the village takes you to the historic Chapel of St Peter on the Wall before following the coast path round to Bradwell Waterside. The walk starts in the village and then follows the Roman Road east to visit the Chapel of St Peter on the Wall. The 7th century chapel is Grade I listed and among the oldest largely intact Christian churches in England. The chapel also marks the start/end of the long distance St Peters Way footpath. The trail could be followed south and then east to visit Tillingham. This route then heads north to Sales Point before passing west along the River Blackwater to Bradwell Waterside village, passing Bradwell Nuclear Power Station on the way. Here you head south along Bradwell Creek before passing the marina opposite Pewet Island. At Orplands you turn east to return to the village.",

You can find them on the High Street with a postcode of CM0 7QL for your sat navs. At Bradwell Waterside there's also the noteworthy Green Man. The historic 16th Century Freehouse is located in a fine spot near the river. You can find them at postcode CM0 7QX."

From Burnham quay, you can also catch a boat to view the seals which make their home at the mouth of the estuary. On the opposite side of the estuary there's the villages of Tollesbury and Goldhanger to visit. For more walking ideas in the area see the Essex Walks page."
