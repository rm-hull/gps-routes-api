  "description": "Explore the grounds of this Grade I listed 14th-century country house on this circular walk in Ripley, North Yorkshire. There's nice trails to follow around the large ornamental lake and through the deer park. Here you can look out for a variety of wildlife including fallow deer, rabbits, squirrels, heron, canada and greylag geese, mallard, teal and wigeon, pheasants and woodpeckers. There's also a beautiful walled garden and pleasure grounds which contain a collection of specimen trees from around the world including thousands of spring flowering bulbs, daffodils, narcissi, snowdrops, aconites and bluebells. Also of interest is the guided tour where you learn all about the castle's history and enjoy six of the rooms including the Library, Drawing rooms, Tower room and Knights Chamber. The Nidderdale Way long distance trail passes to the south of the castle. To extend your walk you could follow the trail west through Hollybank Wood to Hampsthwaite, enjoying views of the River Nidd as you go. The castle is located just a few miles north of Harrogate where you can pick up the Harrogate Ringway and visit the splendid Nidd Gorge. You could visit the castle from Harrogate by following the Nidderdale Greenway shared walking and cycle path from the town centre.",
