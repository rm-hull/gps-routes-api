  "description": "This circular walk visits the delightful Wensleydale village of West Burton before exploring the waterfalls, rivers, countryside and woodland surrounding the settlement. The village is something of a hidden gem of the Yorkshire Dales with a pretty village green surrounded by attractive cottages. The walk starts on the bridge over the Walden Beck and follows footpaths to the Cauldron Falls .  It's a delightful area with a little bridge and a waterside park with lovely views of the rushing falls. After exploring the falls and taking some photos, you head south along the pretty Walden Beck towards Walden. This section climbs to over 1200ft with wonderful views over Wensleydale and Castle Bolton . At Walden you turn north, passing through the woodland of Burton Pasture before returning to the village. West Burton is located just 1.5 miles south of Aysgarth Falls . The falls are considered one of the major attractions of the Yorkshire Dales. The Herriot Way long distance footpath also starts in Aysgarth village. The circular route takes you through areas of the Yorkshire Dales associated with the vet and author James Herriot.",
