  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Dores Beach and Tor Point on the north eastern shores of the famous Loch Ness. You can start your walk from the parking area at the beach. From here you can pick up the shoreline and follow it west along the beach to Tor Point. It's just over a mile walk there and back, so should take around 30 minutes. Along the way there's excellent views over Dores Bay to the surrounding hills. You can extend the walk by continuing north through the woodland around Tor Point to visit Aldourie Castle.",
