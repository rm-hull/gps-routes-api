  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Invermoriston Falls at Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. In the little village can enjoy a walk across the old Thomas Telford\u00a0bridge which crosses the picturesque falls on the River Moriston. From the public car park it is a short stroll south to the early 19th century bridge. After admiring the rushing river you can then follow footpaths through the adjacent woodland for more great views. The epic Great Glen Way runs through the village. You could pick up this waymarked footpath to further explore the area. You could follow the trail south west along Loch Ness to visit Fort Augustus.",
