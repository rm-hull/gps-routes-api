  "description": "This walk takes you around Thornley Woods in Rowlands Gill near Gateshead. The peaceful site has a number of woodland paths and a sculpture trail with a fine carved otter and a red kite. The area is also good for bird watching with great spotted woodpecker, nuthatch, and sparrow hawks to look out for. The park includes a visitor centre with lots of information and an associated car park where you can start the walk. On the way there's nice views of the Thornley Burn with foxgloves and honeysuckle in bloom in the warmer months.",

      "content": "The woods are adjacent to the Derwent Walk Country Park where there are some nice riverside trails along the Derwent River. The waymarked Derwent Valley Walk also runs through the area. One option is to follow the path north towards Blaydon to visit the Shibdon Pond Nature Reserve where there are more bird watching opportunities. Just to the south of the woods is the popular Gibside where there's an 18th century landscaped park to explore. Near here there's also Chopwell Wood. There's some fine walking paths and good mountain bike trails to be found here. Head east and there's Watergate Forest Park to visit. The popular park is located on the site of the former Watergate colliery. It includes woodland trails, a roman fort, a pretty lake and wildflower meadows."
