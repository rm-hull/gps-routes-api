  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle around these pretty woodlands in Pembrokeshire. There's 420 acres to explore with a good mountain bike track running through the centre of the woods. It's a fairly easy path so it's suitable for families. There are also numerous footpaths to follow through the ancient mixed woodland. The route begins near Canaston Bridge next to Blackpool Mill . There is a lay-by immediately south of Canaston Bridge where you can park.  You then pick up the Knight's Way into the forest and follow various waymarked paths around the heart of the woods. If you would like to continue your outing then you could head to the nearby Picton Castle Gardens and Slebech Park where you will find more excellent walking trails. The circular Narberth Walk starts from the nearby market town and visits the woods before heading to the Blackpool Mill. The historic mill is well worth a visit with some pleasant trails along the River Cleddau to try.",
