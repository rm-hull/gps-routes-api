  "description": "This is a popular walk using a lovely section of the Isle of Wight Coast Path to take you between these two seaside resorts. It's a signposted 3.5 mile hike with some moderate hill climbs, a woodland section and fabulous views throughout. Most of the walk is on fairly flat paths but there are some climbs so a reasonable level of fitness is required. You can get the bus back or return the same way if you are feeling energetic! Starting on the front in Shanklin head south past the popular Shanklin Chine with its lovely beach. The chine is worth further exploration if you have time. In it you will find interesting geological features, a wooded coastal ravine,  waterfalls, trees, lush vegetation, and several footpaths and walkways allowing paid access for visitors. After passing the chine you come to Appley Steps where you begin the steepest climb of the walk. It takes you up towards Luccombe village where there's some spectacular cliffs and scenery. The route then heads through Bonchurch Landslips where there are some nice woodland trails, more interesting geological formations and sea glimpses through the trees. You'll also pass Old St. Boniface Church which is worth a visit. The nave and chancel dates from the 11th century, with the bell dating from the 16th century. The final section takes you past Horseshoe Bay and Wheelers Bay before finishing on the front in Ventnor. The popular seaside resort is located to the south of\u00a0St Boniface Down, the highest point on the island. Ventnor is built on steep slopes leading down to the sea and enjoys a microclimate which allows sub tropical plants to flourish. Visit the Ventnor Botanic Garden to see examples. You can extend the walk by continuing west along the coast to St Lawrence and St Catherine's Lighthouse , the most southerly point on the Isle of Wight. Above Ventnor you can climb to Ventnor Downs and St Boniface Down , the highest point on the island. There's fabulous views, wildflowers, heather and New Forest Ponies to be seen on St Boniface Down.",
