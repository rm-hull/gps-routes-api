  "description": "This walk visits the interesting Piercebridge Roman Fort before following the Teesdale Way along the River Tees to nearby Gainford. There's much to enjoy with some fascinating history, lovely riverside paths and some attractive Teesdale countryside to enjoy on the way. The walk starts at the Piercebridge Roman Fort which is located on the banks of the River Tees in the village. There were Romans at the site from about 70 AD until at least the early 5th century. Today Roman remains at the eastern part of the site include parts of the east gate and defences, a courtyard building and an internal road, and a section of the eastern elevation is now preserved and on permanent public display. It's a nice place for an easy stroll with a number of information boards to peruse as you make your way around the ancient site. After exploring the fort you can pick up the Teesdale Way and follow the waymarked trail west toward Gainford. Here you will find a picturesque village green, some historic Georgian Houses, a mineral spa fountain and a pleasant riverside park.",

      "content": "Head a short distance east of the fort and you can visit the Remains of the Roman Bridge which was built in 200AD and rediscovered in 1972. There's a car park nearby giving access to the site which has information boards detailing the history of the bridge. If you follow the Teesdale Way east it will take you into Darlington. Head west and you will come to Barnard Castle where you could visit the ancient remains of the riverside Egglestone Abbey. Greta Bridge and the Meeting of the Waters can also be found in this area. Just south of Darlington there's the village of Hurworth on Tees which includes pleasant riverside trails and a noteworthy pub dating back to the 1400s.
