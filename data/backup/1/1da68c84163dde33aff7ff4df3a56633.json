  "description": "This walk visits the interesting Piercebridge Roman Fort before following the Teesdale Way along the River Tees to nearby Gainford. There's much to enjoy with some fascinating history, lovely riverside paths and some attractive Teesdale countryside to enjoy on the way. The walk starts at the Piercebridge Roman Fort which is located on the banks of the River Tees in the village. There were Romans at the site from about 70 AD until at least the early 5th century. Today Roman remains at the eastern part of the site include parts of the east gate and defences, a courtyard building and an internal road, and a section of the eastern elevation is now preserved and on permanent public display. It's a nice place for an easy stroll with a number of information boards to peruse as you make your way around the ancient site. After exploring the fort you can pick up the Teesdale Way and follow the waymarked trail west toward Gainford. Here you will find  a picturesque village green, some historic Georgian Houses, a mineral spa fountain and a pleasant riverside park.",
