  "description": "This walk in Bristol visits the Oldbury Court Estate where you can enjoy riverside and woodland walks to the historic Snuff Mills. The walk starts at the Snuff Mills car park, next to the River Frome (postcode BS16 1UH for sat navs). From here you can pick up the Frome Valley Walkway and follow the waymarked trail north east along the river. In the park there's an old mill which was used for cutting and crushing stone from the sereies of quarries in the Frome Valley during the late 19th century. The area is also great for wildlife watching with otters seen in the river and various birds in the peaceful woodland. After a while you can then leave the river to explore the Oldbury Court Estate. The estate was originally an old hunting lodge within the Royal Forest of Kingswood. It's now a pleasant park with a number of trails to try.",
