  "description": "Visit the spectacular Henrhyd Falls and the rushing Nant Llech River on this splendid walk in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The falls are the highest in South Wales at 90 feet (27m). There's the additional bonus of being able to walk around the back of the falls and see it from a completely different perspective. The walk starts at the National Trust car park at Dol Henrhyd, Coelbren (postcode:SA10 9PH). From here you follow a footpath heading west to the falls and then along the Nant Llech River towards Ynyswen. On the way you will pass through a lovely wooded valley where you will see another small waterfall and a disused watermill before coming to the River Tawe. Return to the start point on the same path. The final scene of the film The Dark Knight Rises was filmed at Henrhyd Falls, where it doubled as the entrance for the Batcave. This has drawn extra visitors to the site so it can be busy at peak times in the summer holidays.",

They do delicious homemade food with lovely cakes and sweet treats as well. You can find the cafe just south west of the car park at 9 Station Rd, Coelbren, with a postcode of SA10 9P for your sat navs. There's a car park there or in the village nearby."
