  "description": "Climb to this Iron Age Hill Fort and enjoy great views over the Herefordshire countryside on this circular walk. The walk starts from the National Trust's Croft Castle car park. You can explore the beautiful parkland and gardens surrounding the castle before starting your climb to the fort. The route takes you through Croft Wood with its ancient woodland consisting of Spanish chestnut trees. At the top of the hill you can follow footpaths around the fort and enjoy wonderful views to the Welsh hills and mountains. To extend your walk you can follow the Mortimer Trail north to Mortimer Forest and the splendid viewpoint at High Vinnalls, near Ludlow. You can also further explore the 1500 acres of parkland and farmland on the Croft Castle estate. At the 19th century Fish Pool Valley you can enjoy pretty streams and Oak, Ash, Willow, Poplar and Evergreen woodland. There's also some nice trails to follow through the heathland of the adjacent Bircher Common .",
