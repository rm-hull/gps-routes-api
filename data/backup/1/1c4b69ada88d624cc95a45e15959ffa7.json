  "description": "This short walk explores the pretty waterfall at Harmby in the Lower Wensleydale area of the Yorkshire Dales. This hidden gem is located just off the A road east of Leyburn. It's a very peaceful spot which is particularly impressive after heavy rain. It's located just opposite the Pheasant Inn with a path leading down to the falls. There's another well maintained footpath to follow a short distance with the falls surrounded by attractive foliage. Afterwards you can enjoy a little stroll around the village where there's nice old stone cottages and a delightful little stream running through the centre. You could also head out into the countryside on some of the public paths branching off from the village.",

      "content": "The Pheasant Inn, opposite the falls, is a nice place for some refreshments after your stroll. It's a friendly, cosy pub with a real fire and good selection of ales. The landlord also runs a good campsite behing the pub, if you need to stay over."
    },
    {
      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "If you'd like to extend the walk then you could pick up a public footpath to the south of the falls and follow it towards Spennithorne. Head west and you can follow nice riverside paths along the River Ure around Leyburn and Wensley. Around here there's the fabulous limestone escarpment at Leyburn Shawl which provides fine views over Wensleydale. Just to the south there's a nice circular walk to follow around Middleham as well. Just to the east is the noteworthy village of Constable Burton where you can enjoy lovely trails around Constable Burton Hall. The grade-I-listed Georgian mansion includes some beautiful grounds with peaceful woodland, pretty becks and delightful gardens to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks page."
