  "description": "Explore 126 acres of countryside park on the outskirts of Welwyn Garden City at Stanborough Park in Hertfordshire. Attractions include a Watersports Centre, Nature trail, Lakes, a Restaurant and a Coffee Shop. There's also nice waterside paths along the River Lea and the pretty lakes to try. You can extend your walking in the area by continuing along the Lea Valley Walk. If you follow it west you could visit the nearby Lemsford Springs Nature Reserve where there are good wildlife spotting opportunites. Just to the north there's Sherrardspark Wood where there's lots of good woodland walking trails to try.",
