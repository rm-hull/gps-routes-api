  "description": "Explore the beautiful countryside around Royal Tunbridge Wells on this circular walk through the High Weald AONB. The walk passes through a series of steep ridges and valleys used by climbers including Eridge Rocks and Harrison's Rocks. Other highlights include the woodland through Eridge park and Groombridge Place with its moated manor house and beautiful gardens. You'll also pass Tunbridge Wells Common, Pembury Woods and the delightful Dunorlan Park as you pass through the town. The route skirts the southern edge of Tonbridge where you could take a small detour to visit the historic castle and enjoy walks along the River Medway on the Medway Valley Walk. Near here the route also passes close to Tudeley Woods, an RSPB Nature Reserve with a large variety of flora and fauna to see. The start and finish point for the route is at Southborough Common .",
