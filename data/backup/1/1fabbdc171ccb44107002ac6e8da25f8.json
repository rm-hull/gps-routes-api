The station is ideally placed for many cross country routes, and the railway solves the getting back from the other end problem. We were leaving, heading for Spean Bridge. Once I would travel here all the way by train, but this is not really possible to do at short notice anymore because of the insane fare structure in use at this time."

  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Loch Ossian from the remote Corrour Station on Rannoch Moor. The station is situated on the Crianlarich-Fort William/Mallaig branch of the West Highland Line. It is notable as the highest mainline railway station in the United Kingdom. The station is served by regular Abellio ScotRail passenger trains between Glasgow Queen Street and Fort William/Mallaig. The walk starts from the train station where you can pick up a trail heading north east past the smaller Loch Coir' a'Bhric Beag. The trail then continues along the southern side of the loch before finishing at the jetty and boating house at the northern end. The area is popular with red deer so keep your eyes peeled for these beautiful creatures as you make your way through the woods and moor. To continue your lochside walking in the area head west to visit Loch Treig .",

Glen Etive, the Glencoe Lochan Trail, the Three Sisters Glencoe Waterfall Walk and the Pap of Glencoe are also not too far to the west. You could visit the second highest waterfall in Scotland on the Steall Falls Walk. It's a spectacular sight and another of the highlights of the area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
