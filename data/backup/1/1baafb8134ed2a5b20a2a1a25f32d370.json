  "description": "This walk follows a trail along the western side of the stunning Loch Eck in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The walk starts at Glenbranter in the Argyll Forest Park where there is a forestry commission car park. It's located just to the south of Loch Fyne and is a great place to start a whole range of cycle rides and walks. From the car park you can pick up the trails heading south to the loch with views of the River Cur on the way. On the route you'll enjoy attractive pine woodland as you make your way through the Loch Eck Forest. On the lochside paths there's also lovely views across the loch to the surrounding hills. It's a very peaceful and tranquil place, ideal for a relaxing walk in beautiful scenery. At the southern end of the loch you will find the Benmore Botanical Gardens where there's a world-famous collection of plants from the Orient and the Himalaya to North and South America. To continue your walking in the area head east to Ardentinny where you can pick up a waymarked trail on the western side of Loch Long. Just to the south of the Benmore Botanical Gardens you will find the delightful Pucks Glen where there's a lovely trail through a wood gorge with a burn and waterfalls. You can also pick up the stunning walk through Glen Massan at Benmore.",

To the north of Arrochar there's also the impressive Loch Sloy Dam where you can enjoy fine views down to the loch below. Ben Vorlich is also near the loch and a good climb to try in the area. To the north east you can pick up the Lochgoilhead and Loch Goil Walk and explore the area around the pretty village. The loch is an arm of Loch Long and includes more pleasant waterside trails with some waterfalls to visit on the nearby Donich Water. For more walking ideas in the area see the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs Walks page."
