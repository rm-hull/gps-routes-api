  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll along the Kennet and Avon Canal from Newbury to Hungerford via the lovely village of Kintbury. It's a beautiful section of the canal with several pretty locks, old stone bridges and views of the River Kennet which runs alongside the canal. There's lots of wildlife to see too with kingfishers, mute swans, coots, moorhens and herons visitors to the area. At the end of the walk you can catch a train directly back to Newbury. The route starts at Newbury Wharf where there is an information centre and cafe run by the Kennet & Avon Canal Trust. You head west along the canal towpath passing the attractive Victoria Park and several buildings linked to the history of the canal. You continue to the 18th century Newbury Lock before passing Benham Lock and Hamstead Park. Soon you come to the delightful village of Kintbury, named by the Sunday Times in 2007 as one of the 'top ten most sought-after villages in England'. You could take the opportunity here of enjoying refreshments at a canal-side pub. The final section runs from Kintbury to Hungerford, passing Brunsden Lock and the River Dun on the way. In Hungerford there is a pretty wharf and a number of nice pubs. You could head to the 16th century John O' Gaunt and enjoy a well earned drink after your exercise. To continue your waterside walking in the Newbury area you could pick up the Lambourn Valley Way. Following it north from the canal will take you to Donnington Castle and then along the River Lambourn to Boxford. The lovely heathland and woodland of Snelsmore Common Country Park can also be accessed very near to the castle.",
