  "description": "This loop walk explores the area surrounding the pretty village of Fritham in the New Forest. On the walk you'll visit Green Pond, Janesmoor Pond and the popular Cadman's Pool . The walk starts in the village and heads west along country lanes passing the fine Royal Oak Pub. Near here you turn south west to follow footpaths onto Fritham Plain, passing Hiscocks Hill before coming to the pretty Green Pond. You may see some cattle or ponies here as they use it as a watering hole. The paths then head south from the pond to Freeworms Hill, Anses Wood and Cadman's Pool. The beauty spot is an ideal place for a picnic or some birdwatching. From the pool you head north east through the Bentley Inclosures and across Janesmoor Plain to Janesmoor Pond. The pond is a popular spot for young fishers and is another photogenic location on the route. The final section takes you from the pond back to Fritham on quiet country lanes. To continue your walking from Fritham head a short distance north from the Royal Oak to visit Irons Well where you'll find a spring beside a gravelled track once used by gunpowder carriers from a nearby factory. A few miles south of the village you will find the lovely Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary . Here you will find a large herd of fallow deer with a viewing platform overlooking the meadow where the deer congregate. There's also more nice woodland trails to be found in the nearby Latchmore Brook and the Hasley Hill Inclosure .",
