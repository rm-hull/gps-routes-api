  "description": "This circular walk takes you on a tour of the woodland and countryside of Bracknell Forest in Berkshire. The walk passes through varied scenery including coniferous forest, heathland and unspoilt open farmland. Walk highlights include Easthampstead Park with its Victorian Country Mansion surrounded by 60 acres of parkland and Pope\u2019s Meadow where 18th century poet Alexander Pope lived. You will also pass a Site of Special Scientific Interest at Englemere Pond where the pond and surrounding land is full of wildlife. The walk starts and finishes at The Look Out Discovery Centre, Nine Mile Ride, 2 miles south of Bracknell town centre where there is ample free parking. The centre has some interesting nature exhibits, lots of information about the area and cycle hire. From here you head south to Gravel Hill, Pudding Hill and Butter Hill before picking up the waymarked Three Castles Path and following it past Crowthorne and Sandhurst. Around here you could take a detour from the route to visit the lovely Tri Lakes Country Park and Horseshoe Lake where there are some nice waterside trails. The route turns north at Sandhurst heading to Gardener's Green, passing the Heath Lake Nature Reserve where you can look out for herons and other birds. The route then heads past the Victorian mansion at Easthampstead Park before continuing north through Popeswood and Binfield. Near here you turn east to Tickleback Row, Moss End, Warfield and Winkfield Row. The final section takes you south through Burleigh and back into the woodland around the pretty Englemere Pond. The route then heads through Swinley Park before returning to the heritage centre.",
