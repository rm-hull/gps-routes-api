  "description": "This circular walk takes you to this wonderful rocky headland on the Pembrokeshire coast. Strumble Head is a great place for wildlife watching with porpoises and seals regular visitors to the seas below. It's a lovely area with the well known Strumble Head Lighthouse and a beautiful coastline with views towards Dinas Head and Cardigan Bay. This walk starts off at the Strumble Head car park and takes you along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to Porthsychan before returning through the countryside on a country lane. The final stretch back to the car park has great views of the lighthouse for most of the way. If you'd like to extend your walk you could head south along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to the rocky volcanic outcrop Garn Fawr where you will find an Iron Age Hillfort and spectacular views of the surrounding area.",
