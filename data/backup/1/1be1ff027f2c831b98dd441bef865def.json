  "description": "This walk visits Lough Sheelin near Kilnaleck and Mountnugent in County Cavan. You can visit the Crover House Hotel on the northern side of the lake for afternoon tea or Sunday Lunch. From the hotel there are some nice footpaths running along the lake and through the adjacent woodland. It's a lovely place for a stroll with attractive grounds and gardens at the hotel and some fine views across the lake to the surrounding countryside. The lake is a great place for wildlife with great crested grebe, pochard, tufted duck and goldeneye to look out for on the water. To continue your walking in the area head south east to visit the fascinating Loughcrew . This ancient site includes includes a number of tombs thought to date to the 4th millennium BC. There are great views from the hill top to enjoy here as well.",
