  "description": "Climb to the high point on the Isle of Arran and enjoy wonderful views over the surrounding area on this challenging walk. The walk starts from the Cladach car park near Brodick Castle. You can reach Brodick by catching the ferry from Ardrossan Harbour. Trains run to Ardrossan Harbour from Glasgow and take about 45 minutes so the walk is quite accessible if you are coming without a car from the city. From Brodick the route ascends on a good path through woodland and heather moorland. At the 874 m (2,867 ft) summit there are wide ranging views with the Arran peaks, the Mull of Kintyre, the Clyde Estuary and Ireland all visible on a clear day. You descend on the same path with great views of Brodick Bay as you go. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could explore the lovely Brodick Castle Country Park which has lots of good walking trails to try. At the castle you can also pick up the Arran Coastal Way and explore the whole coastline of the island. The 66 mile route is classified as one of Scotland's Great Trails.",
