  "description": "This Northumberland village is in a lovely spot on the River Tyne, just east of Hexham . It's a fine place for a stroll with a historic Roman Fort and a pleasant riverside trail to try. This walk from the town explores the Roman Fort before heading along the River Tyne and visiting the nearby Dilston Castle. The walk starts from the Roman Fort, just to the west of the village centre and the train station. The fort is one of the historical highlights of the area and well worth exploring. Here you will find information boards detailing the Roman occupation which ran until the 5th century. You can also discover Roman armour and trinkets uncovered with the\u00a0Corbridge Hoard\u00a0at the museum.\u00a0The Hoard was\u00a0one of the most significant finds in Roman history, providing a fascinating insight into the life of a soldier on the Hadrian's Wall. From the fort you can pick up a riverside path heading east towards the 17th century bridge over the Tyne. Cross to the other side and head west and you will come to the point where the river meets with Devil's Water. Here you'll find a number of pretty waterfalls and a weir. You can pick up a footpath heading south along the water to Dilston where there's a notable old chapel and Dilston Castle. This photogenic 15th century ruin is designated as a\u00a0Scheduled Ancient Monument. After exploring Dilston the route returns to Corbridge on the same paths.",
