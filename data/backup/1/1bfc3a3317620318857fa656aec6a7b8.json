The cathedral was the brainchild of Edmund Blythe in 1936 after being inspired by the beautiful natural landscape of the Cotswolds on his way back from a remembrance service at Liverpool Cathedral. It took two men nine years to complete the project which is enjoyed by many people throughout the year."
