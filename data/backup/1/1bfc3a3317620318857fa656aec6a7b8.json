The cathedral was the brainchild of Edmund Blythe in 1936 after being inspired by the beautiful natural landscape of the Cotswolds on his way back from a remembrance service at Liverpool Cathedral. It took two men nine years to complete the project which is enjoyed by many people throughout the year."

  "description": "This extraordinary 10 acre park in Whipsnade is planted in the form of a cathedral, using grass avenues for the nave, chancel, transepts, chapels and cloisters and 'walls' with different species of trees. It is run by the National Trust and is perfect for a peaceful stroll in beautiful surroundings. The circular walk below makes use of the Icknield Way Path taking you around the tree cathedral and up to Dunstable Downs. The park is located near Dunstable, Luton and Hemel Hempstead .",
