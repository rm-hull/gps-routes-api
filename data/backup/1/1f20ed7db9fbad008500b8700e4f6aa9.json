Notably, Inistioge and its scenic village green have served as filming locations for several movies. Its growth during the 18th and 19th centuries was closely tied to the development of the Woodstock Estate, owned by the Tighe family."

      "caption": "River Nore Trail just north of Inistioge. The earliest recorded mention of Inistioge dates back to a clash between the kingdom of Osraighi and a Norse army, documented in the Annals of the Four Masters in the year AD 962. Given its strategic position at the River Nore's lowest crossing point and the noted conflict between the Osraige and Olaf Cuaran, King of Dublin, in 964, it's plausible that Inistioge was initially settled by Vikings. In 1169, Thomas FitzAnthony was granted the land, and he established the Augustinian Priory in 1206. The priors played a pivotal role in expanding the community, but Inistioge faced adversity following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540. By 1566, ownership of the Priory's assets had passed to Sir Edmond Butler. In 1608, Inistioge was officially designated as a town, with James I instituting weekly markets on Fridays and an annual fair on December 13th. However, the town endured turmoil during the Cromwellian attack in 1649, eventually falling under Cromwellian control. During the 18th and 19th centuries, significant development occurred as the village's central square was transformed into a planned estate village by the Tighe family of the Woodstock Estate."

Dysart is renowned as the childhood residence of George Berkeley (1685\u20131753), the distinguished Irish philosopher after whom Berkeley, California, and the Trinity College Dublin Berkeley Library are named. Presently under private ownership, the castle is in dire need of restoration. Situated to the south of Thomastown, the site once encompassed a medieval church, the castle, and other structures. Positioned low along the sharp bend of the River Nore, the castle and church grounds were initially contiguous. However, they became distinct entities, separated by a 21-foot gap. Dysart Castle, described as modestly constructed, featured a stone arch dividing it, with a pathway on the second floor leading to the church. The lands and edifices of Dysart were bestowed to the Priory of Kells by founder Geoffrey fitz Robert in 1193. Historical records indicate that it was referred to as Dysart of St. Mo-Colm-\u00f3g, suggesting that St. Colman was revered as the patron saint of the area. Until its dissolution in 1540, the church, castle, and adjacent property were under the ownership of the Priory of Kells. There are conflicting accounts regarding Berkeley's birthplace; nevertheless, he spent his formative years at Dysart, his family's residence situated beside Dysart Castle."

Thomastown, known in Irish as Baile Mhic And\u00e1in and historically referred to as Grennan, is situated in the Leinster province of the southeastern region of Ireland. It stands as a bustling market town along the scenic River Nore, renowned for its abundant salmon and trout population, and boasts an array of historical landmarks in its vicinity. Notable attractions in the area include Jerpoint Abbey, Kilfane Glen gardens, and the esteemed Mount Juliet Golf Course. A prominent feature within Thomastown is Kilfane Glen, a meticulously restored historic garden dating back to the 1790s, complete with a picturesque waterfall, serene woodland trails, and charming ornamental cottages. Recognized as an Irish Heritage Garden, Kilfane Glen received assistance from the European Union Cultural Commission in 1993 to support its preservation and upkeep. The exquisite landscape within the Kilfane House demesne was meticulously crafted during the 1790s by the estate's proprietors, Sir John and Lady Power, with contributions from Sir Richard Power, Sir John's twin brother. Adjacent to the town lies the remarkable ruins of Jerpoint Abbey, a magnificent structure dating back to the 12th century. Furthermore, Thomastown boasts the nearby Grennan Castle, an imposing oblong-shaped fortress erected in the 13th century by Thomas FitzAnthony. While the castle remained well-maintained until the early 19th century, portions of it were subsequently dismantled for construction purposes."
