  "description": "This fine circular walk runs from Muker to Keld in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. On the route you'll enjoy waterside paths along the River Swale and visit a series of beautiful waterfalls. The walk starts in the village of Muker, located at the western end of\u00a0beautiful Swaledale\u00a0in\u00a0North Yorkshire. From the car park you can pick up paths heading north towards the river, passing through the beautiful Muker Meadows which are covered in beautiful wildflowers during the summer months. Riverside paths then take you up to West Arn Gill, Bracken Hill and Kisdon Force Waterfall. These stunning falls drop 10 metres (33\u00a0ft)\u00a0over two cascades and are surrounded by Kisdon Force Woods with mixed broad-leaved\u00a0woodland\u00a0including ash,\u00a0wych elm\u00a0and\u00a0rowan\u00a0trees. After enjoying the falls the route continues past East Stonesdale to Catrake Force.  It's another photogenic spot, comprising of a series of 4 steps each with its own small waterfall. The largest single drop is about 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m). You continue along the path to Currack Falls or just cross the bridge to Keld. The village is the crossing point of the\u00a0Coast to Coast Walk\u00a0and the\u00a0Pennine Way\u00a0long-distance footpaths at the head of\u00a0Swaledale. If you'd like to stop for refreshments then a tea room and small shop operate at\u00a0Park Lodge\u00a0from Easter to autumn. Out of season, local volunteers provide a self service caf\u00e9 for visitors in the village\u2019s\u00a0Public Hall. In Keld you can pick up the Pennine Way to return to Muker. The waymarked trail will lead you south past Birk Hill and North Gang Scar before coming into Muker where the walk finishes.",
