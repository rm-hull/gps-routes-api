  "description": "This attractive Warwickshire based village lies just to the east of Henley in Arden. It's a historic place with several 16th and 17th century half-timbered cottages and a noteworthy church which includes an English Gothic architecture bell tower dating back to the 15th century. This circular walk from the village uses a mixture of country lanes and public footpaths to explore the surrounding countryside. On the way you will visit Claverdon Hall and the pleasant trails on Yarningdale Common. From here you continue west to link up with the Stratford Upon Avon Canal where you can enjoy more easy waterside walking along the towpath. To extend the walk you could head north to the Grand Union Canal via Pinley Green.",
