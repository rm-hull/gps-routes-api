  "description": "This Derbyshire village makes an ideal starting point for exploring a beautiful part of the Peak District. It's a popular place for walkers with open moorland, rushing rivers and several wonderful climbs to try. This circular walk visits some of the highlights of the area including the ancient Padley Chapel, the River Derwent, Curbar Edge and Froggatt Edge . The walk starts from Grindleford railway station which is reachable from Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly. From here you follow footpaths west to Padley Chapel. The chapel is a Grade I listed building and sits next to the ruins of Padley Hall which is a Scheduled Monument. Soon after passing the chapel you pick up the waymarked Derwent Valley Heritage Way and follow it south along the river to Calver . Here you cross the river and head east to climb Curbar Edge. This area is popular with rock climbers and provides magnificent views over the surrounding hills. You can also look out for red deer on the moors and rare birdlife such as the Ring Ouzel. The route then continues north along the neighbouring Froggatt Edge before descending back to the station. There's more great views over the White Peak on this final section. The Edge also includes interesting rock formations, sheltered birch woodland and lots of lovely heather in the late summer.",
