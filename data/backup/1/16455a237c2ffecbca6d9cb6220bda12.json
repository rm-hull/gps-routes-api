  "description": "This walk follows the old route of the Perth to Lochearnhead railway from Lochearnhead to St Fillans. It's a pleasant walk along a grassy path, passing the remains of old railway bridges and embankments on the way. The route runs for just over 7 miles and includes peaceful woodland sections through Derry Wood and Glentarken Wood. There's also some nice views of the surrounding hills and the beautiful Loch Earn, especially towards the end of the walk. In St Fillans you can explore a set of very well preserved railway station buildings too. You can extend your exercise on the St Fillans to Comrie Railway Walk. This continues east to Dalchonzie and Comrie along the old line.",
