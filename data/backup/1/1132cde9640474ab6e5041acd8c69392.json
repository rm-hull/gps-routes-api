Wanless Water is a small stream that flows southwards roughly parallel to the canal, before being culverted beneath the M65 motorway to emerg again to view here, being visible from the footpath that leads from Greenfield Road to the canal towpath. Wanless Water then flows into Colne Water about 100 metres further on."

  "description": "This Lancashire market town in the Borough of Pendle near Nelson. There are fine views of the Pennine Hills, including Pendle Hill which is one of the more popular walking highlights of the immediate area. This circular walk from the town visits some of the local reservoirs, the Wanless Water river and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The walk starts from Langroyd Park, just to the north of the town. From here you can pick up trails to take you along Foulridge Reservoir and then on to Slipper Hill Reservoir. After rounding the reservoir you can then pick up a shared cycling and walking trail running south along Wanless Water to Barrowford Reservoir. The Barrowford Locks are also located here. It's a scenic section of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal which includes a car park and good surfaced paths. The route then heads east along Colne Water through the Greenfield Road Nature Reserve before heading through the town centre and returning to the car park at Langroyd Park.",
