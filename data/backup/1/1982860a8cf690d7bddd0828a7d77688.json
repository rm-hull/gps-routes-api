  "description": "This National Trust owned estate near Swindon has miles of lovely walking trails taking you through attractive parkland and farmland. The walk starts from the National Trust Estate car park at Coleshill. You then head south through the countryside to the woodland of Waterloo Copse and on to Waterloo Lodge. You continue past the 18th century Strattenborough Castle and then to Ashencopse cottage and Ashen Copse Woods. The route then heads to the prettty village of Great Coxwell where you will find the interesting 13th-century monastic barn. After admiring this old Costwold stone structure the route then heads west through the countryside back to Coleshill. The route passes near to Badbury Clump . Here you will find bluebell woodland and Bradbury Hill where there is an Iron Age hill fort known as Badbury Camp. There are also nice views over the Vale of White Horse to the south and the Thames Valley.",
