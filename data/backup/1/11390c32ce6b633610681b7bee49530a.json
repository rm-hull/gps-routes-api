Crag Mill in Wildboarclough was built in 1793 and operated intermittently for the spinning and printing of calico and other cloths. Designs were printed at the mill on plain carpets provided by John Bright, one of which was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1850. Crag Hall was built in 1796 by the mill owner, while Crag Lodge housed the mill manager and Edinboro Cottages housed mill workers. 3 mills were eventually built on the site, but they were mostly demolished by 1957."

  "description": "This Cheshire based village is located in a fine scenic spot in the Peak District National Park. It's a popular place for walkers with miles of trails to follow around the surrounding Macclesfield Forest and Trentabank Reservoir. There's also a fine village pub dating back to the 17th century. This walk from the village climbs to the nearby Shutlingsloe hill before heading into the forest and visiting its series of pretty reservoirs. You can reach the hill by following a footpath north west from the village. This will take you to the 560 metre high summit where you can enjoy wonderful views over the Cheshire Plain and the Peak District hills. Continue north west and you will soon come to the peaceful woodland trails of the forest. These will lead you to Trentabank Reservoir where you can enjoy lovely waterside trails to Ridgegate and Bottoms Reservoir. The walk then climbs into the popular Tegg's Nose Country Park another walking highlight of the area. Here you can enjoy more amazing vistas from the park's multiple viewpoints. To continue your walking in the area head east to visit Three Shires Head on the expansive Axe Edge Moor. It's a significant location where the counties of Cheshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire meet. There's also a photogenic Grade II-listed packhorse bridge over the River Dane and lots of pretty waterfalls to see here too.",
