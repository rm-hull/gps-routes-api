This monochrome July 1977 photo shows its final resting-place in shake holes on the north side of the hill. Only the tail gunner (W/O Alan G. Small RNZAF) survived after getting to Birkdale Farm, which is 3km north over rough ground and north of Maize Beck and which can at times be very difficult to cross. The aircraft, which was then arguably the most complete wreck in the UK, was lifted off the fell using RAF Puma Helicopters on 1st September 1977. The parts are stored away in the hope that LK488 can one day be rebuilt for display. In the background just right of centre can be seen the 767m Meldon; the Pennine Way crossing its southern part. Apart from that, the intervening ground is rough, boggy and pathless. Cow Green Reservoir is 5km to the north and out of shot to the right. Taken on 12th July 1977 - G4YSS."

It is the source of a small watercourse and springs out of the ground at around 725m ASL, roughly 1km NE of the summit of Mickle Fell. Running north, it eventually flows into Maize Beck. All of what is shown is within NY8025 square. The photo is looking NNW down the slope over frosted grass, in thin low-cloud. In the distance, the gradient is seen to ease and the slope gives way to an area of rougher, boggier ground at around 655m ASL. Beyond that the gradient increases again as the land falls toward the northern edge of the square. Taken on 27 December 2008 at 14:00 - G4YSS."

  "description": "This walk climbs to the highest point in County Durham at Mickle Fell. It's a significant fell but is less frequently climbed than some of its more well known neighbours due to its remote position. Please note the area is part of the Warcop Training Area, a Ministry of Defence firing range. Click here for information on access to the area. Click here for access times. You can start the walk from the parking area on the B6276, south of the fell. You can then follow the MOD boundary fence north for just under 4 miles to reach the summit cairn which stands at a height of 2,585 ft (788 m). The fell is significant as being the highest point within the historic county of Yorkshire and the highest point within County Durham.",
