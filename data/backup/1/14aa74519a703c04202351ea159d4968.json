  "description": "Climb to the highest point in the Cambrian Mountains on this challenging circular walk in Ceredigion. There are wonderful views of the reservoirs, countryside and forests of mid-wales to enjoy. The walk starts from the parking area on the A44 at \u00a0Esteddfa Gurig. You then pass a farm and then through a gate marked 'All Walks' before beginning the ascent. The path takes you to the summit of Pen Pumlumon Fawr which stands at a height of 752 metres (2,467\u00a0ft). Here you will find a trig point and magnificent views in all directions. You can then descend the same way or via Pen Y Drawsallt, to the west. Nant-y-moch Reservoir lies just to the west of the mountain. It's a nice place to extend your walking in the area with a peaceful lakeside trail to try.",
