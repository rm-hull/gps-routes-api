  "description": "This walk climbs to Dover's Hill from the lovely market town of Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds. The hill is a high point on the limestone escarpment that effectively forms the northern edge of the Cotswolds. There is a spectacular view northwards across the Avon valley from here. You start off in the centre of Chipping Campden with its wonderful limestone terraced main street which dates from the 14th century to the 17th century. The 17th century market hall arches are a particularly iconic Cotswolds piece of architecture. From Chipping Campden you pick up the Cotswold Way and follow it out of the town to Dover's Hill. The hill stands at a height of 754 feet (230 metres) with splendid views over the surrounding Cotswolds countryside. On a clear day you can also see the Black Mountains of South Wales and the Long Mynd in Shropshire. If you would like to continue your walking from Chipping Campden then you could follow the Monarch's Way to the nearby Hidcote Manor Garden. You can also follow the path to the village of Ebrington where you can pick up the Ebrington and the Foxcote Estate circular walk.",

Here you'll find The Ebrington Arms an award winning pub which does excellent food and is set in a wonderful village location with fine views of the surrounding Cotswolds countryside. It's a special place and was recently voted the UK's number 1 village pub by The Times. The inn also has an interesting history, with its charming stone building dating all the way back to the 1640s. Inside there's period pieces including wooden fireplaces and beamed ceilings. You can find it in the village on May Lane at a postcode of GL55 6NH for your sat navs. The pub is also very dog friendly and can provide treats for your pet. The Donnington Way - Cotswolds Pub Walk passes through the village too. The long circular walk visits 15 fine old Donnington Brewery pubs in the Cotswolds."

The circular Upper Quinton Walk also visits Hidcote from the village to the north. The sister village of Lower Quinton includes a noteworthy 16th century pub once owned by Henry VIII."
