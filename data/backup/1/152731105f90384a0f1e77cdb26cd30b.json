  "description": "This walk climbs to Dover's Hill from the lovely market town of Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds.  The hill is a high point on the limestone escarpment that effectively forms the northern edge of the Cotswolds. There is a spectacular view northwards across the Avon valley from here. You start off in the centre of Chipping Campden with its wonderful limestone terraced main street which dates from the 14th century to the 17th century. The 17th century market hall arches are a particularly iconic Cotswolds piece of architecture. From Chipping Campden you pick up the Cotswold Way and follow it out of the town to Dover's Hill. The hill stands at a height of 754 feet (230 metres) with splendid views over the surrounding Cotswolds countryside. On a clear day you can also see the Black Mountains of South Wales and the Long Mynd in Shropshire. If you would like to continue your walking from Chipping Campden then you could follow the Monarch's Way to the nearby Hidcote Manor Garden. You can also follow the path to the village of Ebrington where you can pick up the Ebrington and the Foxcote Estate circular walk.",
