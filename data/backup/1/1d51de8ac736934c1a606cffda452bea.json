  "description": "This short circular walk explores the immediate area around the Pym Chair car park on the Derbyshire/Cheshire border in the Peak District National Park. There are many fine hill top walks to do from the elevated position of the car park. The splendid geology at Windgather Rocks is just to the north. There are more fine views from Shining Tor and Cats Tor to the south. To the east there's waterside trails around the lovely Errwood Reservoir and Fernilee Reservoir. There's also some fine heather moorland and peaceful woodland trails to try in this popular walking area.",
