Nearly 250 acres of Wallasea Island have been flood to creat a wild life haven."

  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Wallasea Island on the Essex coast. The area is a RSPB nature reserve with marshland, lagoons, sea views and lots of birdlife to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for avocet, black tailed godwit, marsh harriers and spoonbill as you make your way along the footpath. You may also see seals in the water at certain times of year. You can start the walk from western end of the island by catching a ferry from Burnham on Crouch on the opposite side of the river. There's also a RSPB car park near here too. A public footpath then runs east along the northern edge of the island, with lovely views over the River Crouch. At the eastern side of the island there are views over to Foulness Island which lies at the opposite side of the River Roach.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you could try the circular Burnham on Crouch Walk which takes you around the pretty harbour to Creeksea. The Roach Valley Way also skirts the western edge of the reserve. You can pick up this waymarked footpath to explore the River Roach estuary where there are more good bird watching opportunities. The trail visits the little village of Paglesham which lies just to the west of the island. The village is a pleasant place for a stroll with trails along the river and Pagelsham Creek. There's also a fine 17th century pub for refreshments afterwards."
