Today only the western tower of the Abbey remains, as well as some ruined walls to the immediate south-east. The tower is attached to a chapel (now a church) built in the 17th century, but what remains is a\u00a0Scheduled Ancient Monument. Several areas of\u00a0ancient woodland\u00a0remain: Parkbank Wood to the East of the Abbey, Old Park Wood and Little Wood Bank to the south, Gulleys Wood in the centre of the park and Ladies Spring Wood to the west. The\u00a0Sheffield Round Walk\u00a0arrives from Park Bank Wood, running eastwards through Chancet Wood and on to\u00a0Graves Park."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you on a tour of the parks, countryside, woods, waterways and villages surrounding the Yorkshire city of Sheffield. The walk is signposted and runs for about 14 miles so can be completed in a day. You can start the walk from any number of places but this route starts from the lovely Endcliffe Park in the Sharrow Vale area of the city. You enter the park at Hunters Bar and then follow the pretty Porter Brook through woodland to Bingham Park at the western end. You continue along the brook through Bingham Park and Whiteley Woods passing Endcliffe Park and Forge Dam on the way. After emerging from the woods you head through the lovely countryside of the Mayfield Valley along Clough Lane. This leads to the peaceful wooded area of Porter Clough where you turn south to the little village of Ringinglow on the edge of the Peak District National Park. After passing through the village you then head through the pretty Limb Valley with the Limb Brook and nice woodland trails to enjoy on this section. The next stage takes you through one of the real highlights in Whirlow Brook Park. Here you'll find Rhododendrons, Azaleas, woodland, surfaced footpaths, gorgeous gardens and a rock pool with a waterfall. After leaving the park you continue south east through Ecclesall Woods where you'll pass the delightful Abbeydale Miniature railway. You continue towards Beauchief Abbey passing through Ladies Spring Wood on the way. The Limb Brook runs through this area of ancient woodland with a variety of birds to look out for. These include\u00a0nuthatch, the\u00a0green woodpecker, the\u00a0great spotted woodpecker\u00a0and the\u00a0lesser spotted woodpecker. Beauchief Park includes the remains of the 12th century Beauchief Abbey, a 17th century church and a pretty mill pond. You can also pick up the River Sheaf Walk near here. This will take you to the lovely Millhouses park and then on into the city centre. The route continues east to Meadow Head and Graves Park. The park is a mixture of open parkland and woodland, with several streams and three lakes. There is also an animal farm with many rare breeds of cattle, pigs, chickens and donkeys. After Graves park you turn north through Lees Hall golf club and Meersbrook Park. The final section takes you through Chelsea Park and Brincliffe before finishing back at Endcliffe Park.",
