  "description": "This historic Essex based village includes a train station and some fine Tudor timber framed buildings. It's also located on a popular long distance footpath and surrounded by some attractive arable fields for walkers. The village is located just a few miles south of Saffron Walden . This circular walk from Newport uses part of the Harcamlow Way to visit the valley of Debden Water and the neighbouring village of Debden. The walk starts in the village centre just to the north of the train station. Here you can pick the Harcamlow Way and follow the waymarked footpath east along the pretty Debden Water. You'll pass a waterfall and the picturesque Debden lake before coming to the village of the same name. The route then heads south past Spinney Wood to Rook End where you turn west along a bridle track. The trail passes Horseley Wood and Cabbage Wood before returning to Newport.",
