It is now used for domestic supply and another compensation reservoir has been built down stream in the Jumbles."

  "description": "This walk visits a notable historical landmark near Bolton. It's a fine place for an easy stroll and there are several other local highlights to see if you'd like to further stretch your legs. This circular walk visits the tower before heading to Entwistle Reservoir, Wayoh Reservoir and Jumbles Country Park . You can start the walk from the free car park at Turton Tower or there's another parking area at Jumbles Reservoir just to the south. On the route there's also Entwistle train station which is not far from the tower. The tower itself is Grade I listed and was originally built in the late Middle Ages and then added to in the 16th century. You can enjoy a tour inside before a stroll around the grounds which include woodlands, a dovecote and a kitchen garden. After exploring the tower the route picks up the Witton Weavers Way and follows the waymarked path north to Entwistle Reservoir. You then turn east to visit Wayoh Reservoir where you can follow a nice waterside trail south along the eastern side of the water. The route then heads through Turton Bottoms to Jumbles Country Park where there's another pretty reservoir. From here it's a short walk through Chapeltown to return to the Tower car park where the route finishes.",
