  "description": "This peaceful little village is located in a lovely spot on the edge of the Forest of Bowland AONB. It's a picturesque place with pretty cottages, a pond and Lappet Mill, an old cotton weaving mill which is still in use. This little circular walk starts in the village car park and takes you north to the mill pond and the 19th century St John's Church. On the way there's bluebell woods, a mill pond weir and views of the River Calder which runs through the area. There are also some pleasant footpaths through the countryside to the east of the settlement. To continue your walking in the area head north to one of the local area highlights at Nicky Nook. It's a lovely place with fine views and several pretty reservoirs to enjoy.",
