It was founded as an Augustinian priory by the 2nd Earl of Chester in the early 12th century and never progressed to become an abbey. By the mid 1100s it was already reduced to serving nearby Repton Priory and continued as such until the Dissolution in the 16th century. It then passed through the hands of many owners, gaining the name Calke Abbey in 1808, before being passed to the National Trust in the 1980s. Nothing of the original building remains, the earliest masonry being Elizabethan. It was largely rebuilt in 1701-1704."

  "description": "This walk takes you around the magnificent Calke country estate located in Ticknall, Derby. The walk begins at the car park and takes you along the beautiful Staunton Harold Reservoir before exploring the woodland, ponds and meadows of Calke Park. There is also a deer park with Calke's herd of fallow and red deer, while the wetlands area is also home to more wildlife with dragonflies and damselflies to see. The site has an interesting history having been an Augustinian priory from the 12th century until its dissolution by Henry VIII. If you head a mile north you can visit the visitor centre and enjoy a well surfaced walk along the water to their wildflower meadow. To continue your walking in the park try our circular Ticknall Tramway Tunnel Walk . This visits the old industrial tramway which\u00a0connected the brickyards, lime quarries and lime yards of Ticknall to the Ashby Canal . The horse drawn system operated from 1802 to 1913. Today part of the route makes for a nice leisurely walk or cycle.",
