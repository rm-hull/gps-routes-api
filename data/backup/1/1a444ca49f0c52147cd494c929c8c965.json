  "description": "This super Nature Reserve near Carlisle has a series of cycling and walking trails to try. The area consists of reedbeds, lagoons, woodland, wild flower meadows and an elemental garden. Look out for a variety of birdlife including Skylarks, Meadow Pipit and Stonechat in the meadows. Curlew, Snipe and Oystercatcher can be seen around the wetlands area. You can also see Roe Deer, Fox and Red Squirell in the woodland. The reserve has an excellent visitor centre with information about the different interactive trails. Cycle hire is also available so you can explore the reserve by bike too.",
