  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the Flotterstone visitor centre in the Pentland Hills. The 2.5 mile route starts from the car park and follows a waymarked trail towards the pretty Glencorse Reservoir. It's a fairly easy walk with a small climb which provides nice views back down to the water. Starting from the car park you follow the trails west along Glencorse Burn before a short woodland section leads you to the reservoir. You can then follow a path along the water before climbing toward Castlelaw Hill. From here it is a short descent back to the car park and the finish point of the walk. On the way look out for the Blue plaque dedicated to Nobel prize winner CTR Wilson. The local man won the prize for physics in 1927, after devising a cloud chamber apparatus to reproduce clouds, which proved invaluable in detecting ionising radiation. To continue your walking in the area, head west to visit Harlaw Reservoir. The site has a nice 2 mile footpath running around the perimeter with views to the adjacent Threipmuir Reservoir. Another good option is to head towards Livingston and visit Eliburn Reservoir and Cobbinshaw Reservoir where there's more lovely views and lots of wildfowl to look out for on the water. To the south you will find Gladhouse Reservoir, Edgelaw Reservoir and Portmore Loch which are also very peaceful and beautiful.",

      "content": "The Scald Law Walk starts at the reservoir. You can follow the trails west to climb the hill for some fine views over the area. Near Glencorse Reservoir you can pick up the Penicuik to Dalkeith Railway Walk. This shared cycling and walking trail will take you along an easy path to the lovely Dalkeith Country Park. To the west there's Harperrig Reservoir to explore. Here you'll find some interesting wildlife including various wildfowl and the Eurasian otter. The site also includes views of the Water of Leith and the 15th century Cairns Castle ruins. At the eastern end of the lake you can pick up the long distance Cross Borders Drove Road. It runs south through the Pentland Hills to West Linton, Peebles, Traquair and then on to Hawick via the Yarrow Valley. To the south east there's Roslin Glen Country Park. The pretty park includes wooded glens, the ruined Roslin Castle and views of the rushing River North Esk. On the nothern side of the park you can also visit the noteworthy Rosslyn Chapel. There's some stunning architecture at the 15th century site which includes some pleasant trails through a wooded glen to the ruins of Roslin Castle. The chapel became famous when it was featured in Dan Brown's the Da Vinci Code. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pentland Hills Walks page."
