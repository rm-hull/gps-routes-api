  "description": "Explore nearly 700 acres of parkland and coast on this delightful circular walk through the South Downs. The Country Park is named after the famous Seven Sisters chalk cliffs on the Sussex Heritage Coast. On the route you will enjoy fabulous views of the Cuckmere river before heading towards the beautiful coastline. The walk starts from the country park visitor centre next to Exceat Bridge at a postcode of BN25 4AB for your sat navs. From here you can pick up the South Downs Way National Trail and follow the waymarked path south along the Cuckmere River to the Seven Sisters cliffs. The path then heads east along the wonderful coast path to a significant landmark at Birling Gap . This special area is run by the National Trust and includes the famous Belle Tout lighthouse. There's also fabulous views along to the nearby Beachy Head and 500 acres of open chalk grassland with a wide variety of butterflies and wildflowers to look out for. The route then leaves the coast and heads north towards Friston Forest where you can enjoy some nice woodland trails and look out for rare butterflies and deer.  These trails will lead you west back to the visitor centre where the route finishes. There are a number of other footpaths and trails in the Park - further information and trail maps can be found in the Visitor Centre. Cycling is permitted on the valley floor and there is a concrete track which offers access to the beach. Mountain biking is also popular in Friston Forest so much of this area is great for cyclists as well as walkers.",
