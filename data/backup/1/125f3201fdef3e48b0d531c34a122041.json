For many centuries Limekilns was also the northern terminus for a ferry linking it to Bo'ness on the southern side of the Forth. This found an echo in Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped: and it was from Limekilns that David Balfour and Alan Breck were carried across the Forth in a rowing boat."

  "description": "This walk takes you along a section of the Fife Coastal Path from Culross to the village of Limekilns. The walk runs for just under 8 miles, passing Preston Island, the Torryburn, Crombie and Charlestown before reaching Limekilns. Near the start you will pass the Torry Bay Nature Reserve which includes a cycle path around Preston Island. The reserve is well worth exploring with a series of lagoons and a number of wading and wintering birds to look out for. On the walk there are some splendid views over the Firth of Firth. The route also follows a surfaced path along National Cycle Route 76 so is great for cycling as well. For the opening section of the trail see the Kincardine To Culross Walk which will take you west to the trail head at Kincardine.",
