  "description": "This walk in Glen Clova visits the lovely Loch Brandy. The walk starts from the car park in Clova. Cross the road from here and you can pick up a well defined footpath running north to the loch. It's a steady climb, running for about 1.5 miles to the waterside. The pretty loch is surrounded by steep hills and is a really stunning sight. There are paths running up and around the water as well. These give great views back down to the water but are more challenging than the relatively easy path up to the loch. To continue your walking in Glen Clova, head a few miles north west to the wonderful Corrie Fee Nature Reserve. The area is rich with wildlife and also includes beautiful alpine flowers with rare mountain willows clinging to the steep crags of the bowl shaped valley. You can reach the reserve by following a country lane north west from the car park on our Glen Clova Walk. It's a nice 3 mile hike, with views of the River South Esk and finishing at the pretty Glendoll picnic area. A few miles to the north there are more nice waterside trails around Loch Muick and the challenging climb to Lochnagar .",

Head into nearby Ballater and you could pick up the popular 7 Bridges Walk. The circular walk explores the area around the town visiting a series of old bridges. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
