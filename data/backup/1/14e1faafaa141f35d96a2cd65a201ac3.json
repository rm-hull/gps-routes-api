  "description": "The Forest Way in Essex runs from Loughton station to Hatfield Forest. The walk starts at the town of Loughton, taking you through Epping Forest and Epping Green towards Harlow where you pass through Harlow Common. The route continues north passing Hatfield Heath and Woodside Green before finishing at the lovely Hatfield Forest Park with its resident deer. Around Hatfield Forest you can link up with the Flitch Way which runs towards nearby Great Dunmow .",

It uses part of the Stort Valley Way to explore the river and the pretty Pishiobury Park in Sawbridgeworth. There's also a nice riverside pub at the end of the walk to visit.
