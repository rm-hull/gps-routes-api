  "description": "This walk visits the 12th century Framlingham Castle and follows the public footpaths surrounding the attractive Suffolk based market town. You can park at the castle car park to start your walk. The paths then take you around the pretty mere which is a Suffolk Wildlife Trust nature reserve and bird sanctuary. From here there are splendid views back over the water to the castle. The paths then take you around Framlingham College before heading back towards the castle. Here you can walk the full length of the parapet walls and climb some of the 13 towers for views across the mere. There's also the option of following footpaths through the countryside north east to Brabling Green. You can virtually explore the grounds of the castle by using the google street view link below!",
