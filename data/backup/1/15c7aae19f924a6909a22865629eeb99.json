  "description": "This walk or cycle takes you along the trackbed of the old Sprat and Winkle Line which ran between Andover and Redbridge in Hampshire. The route starts in the town of Stockbridge and heads south along the old railway towards Romsey. You can start off at the public parking area at Common Marsh just south of Stockbridge. From here you can pick up the Test Way and follow it south along the Sprat And Winkle Line path. You'll pass Horsebridge before coming to Stonymarsh where you can visit the historic Mottisfont Abbey. On the route you'll also pass the site of the old Horsebridge Station and enjoy views of the River Test. The route is part of National Cycle Route 246 so also suitable for cyclists.",
