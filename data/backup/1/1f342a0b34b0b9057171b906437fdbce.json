  "description": "This is a linear walk through the Peak District's Hope Valley, from Castleton to Hathersage. It's quite a gentle route taking you through the middle of the Hope Valley along three of the waterways running through the district. There's nice waterside sections along streams and rivers with great views of the surrounding Peak District Hills. Starting at Castleton you head east along the pretty Peakshole Water stream. The stream joins the River Noe at the village of Hope before passing Bamford and joining the River Derwent. Here you join a section of the Derwent Valley Heritage Way to take you into Hathersage. Around Bamford you have the option of picking up the Thornhill Trail cycling and walking route. If you head north from the river at Shatton you can pick up the trail. It will take you along a disused railway line to the nearby Ladybower Reservoir. Near the end of the Thornhill trail there is the option to climb to Win Hill. From here you can enjoy fabulous views over the reservoir and the Hope Valley. Also nearby are the climbs to Bamford Edge and Stanage Edge. Here you will find interesting rock formations and more great views over the valley below. Other good options for exploring this beautiful area include the Castleton Circular Walk. This will take you to up to Mam Tor where you can explore the Great Ridge and Lose Hill.",
