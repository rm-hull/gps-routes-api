The route begins with grassy slopes featuring hardy plants such as sheep\u2019s fescue and common bent grass. As you climb, you may notice patches of heather and bilberry, particularly in the mid-elevation moorland sections. Nearer the summit, the vegetation becomes sparse, with alpine species like moss campion and thrift thriving in the harsh environment\u200b."

In the valley below, the spoil heaps of the disused Glanrafon slate quarry can be seen, and beyond that, what looks like twin lakes between the clouds, is Llyn y Dywarchen, which has a small island at its narrow point. The large lake below Mynydd Mawr is Llyn Cwellyn, a reservoir, and, in the far distance, the broad sweep of Caernarfon Bay can be seen through a gap in the clouds."

  "description": "Climb to the summit of the highest mountain in Wales on this challenging walk. The Llanberis Path is the longest of the six routes to the top of Snowdon but because of it's gradual elevation it is generally considered the easiest route to the summit. It's very popular with leisure walkers as it runs parallel with the Snowdon Mountain railway which starts at Llanberis. As such you can use the railway to take you up (or down) part of the route. The path starts in Llanberis near to the Royal Victoria Hotel and climbs towards Hebron Station with great views back towards Dinorwig Slate Quarry and Elidir Fawr. You continue to Halfway House, with wonderful views of Moel Cynghorion, Foel Goch, Foel Gron, Moel Eilio and the Cwm Brwynog valley. At Halfway House  you can purchase refreshments in the summer months. The next stage ascends towards Cwm Glas Bach with views of the Llyn Du'r Arddu lake. The final section takes you from  Bwlch Glas to the summit where there are magnificent views over Snowdonia, Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Peak District and the Lake District. If you're looking for more challenging climbs to the summit you could try the Snowdon Miners Track or the Snowdon Pyg Track. The peak can also be reached by following a longer trail to Moel Eilio Foel Gron and Foel Goch. For an exhilarating circular ridge walk, taking in the Crib Goch ridge, try the Snowdon Horseshoe .",
