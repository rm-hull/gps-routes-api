  "description": "This peaceful circular walk takes you through the National Memorial Arboretum and its surrounding countryside in Alrewas, near Lichfield in Staffordshire. There are 30,000 trees in the 150 acre Arboretum, forming a unique living tribute to those who have served and continue to serve our country. There are also over 300 thought-provoking memorials, each with a story to tell. This walk starts in the Arboretum car park and takes you through the grounds to Wychnor Viaduct on the River Trent. You will pass the pretty Croxall Lakes Nature Reserve. The reserve consists of two large lakes which attract various wildfowl and waders during the autumn months. It's a pretty area with reedbeds and the River flowing through it. Look out for otters and short-eared owls during winter. From the nature reserve you continue to Catholme and Wynchnor Bridges where you pick up the Trent and Mersey Canal. A nice waterside section along the towpath takes you into Alrewas before returning to the finish point at the car park. You can virtually explore the National Memorial Arboretum using the google street view link below. You can extend your walking in the area on our Alrewas and Fradley Junction Walk. The route takes you along the Trent and Mersey Canal to the attractive Fradley Junction with its locks, barges and classic old pub.",
