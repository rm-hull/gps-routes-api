  "description": "This easy walk follows a nice footpath along the old Buckingham railway line near the centre of Buckingham. It's a very pretty area with wildlife ponds, shady woodlands and an orchard to see. Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of flora and fauna including woodland birds, butterflies, dragonflies, amphibians and wild flowers. The walk starts just off the Tingewick Road near to the university. You can then follow the flat footpath south east to the A421. Near the start you'll pass St Rumbold's Well which is an interesting part of Buckingham's history related to the 6th century child saint. You'll also pass the River Ouse and the impressive weir at the 'Flosh' & Lords Bridge. The walk can be extended by heading north east along the Buckingham Circular Walk to Bourton Park along the Buckingham Brook.",
