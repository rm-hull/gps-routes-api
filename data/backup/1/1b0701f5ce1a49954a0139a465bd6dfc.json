  "description": "This long distance trail runs through Wiltshire from Coate Water Country Park to Salisbury Cathedral, passing a series of fascinating ancient sites on the way. The walk starts off in Coate Water Country Park, on the southern edge of Swindon. Here you can enjoy a walk along the lake before heading south towards Chiseldon where you will pick up the Chiseldon and Marlborough Railway Path. This shared cycling and walking trail runs south along a disused railway before you turn west to follow country trails to the lovely Barbury Castle Country Park. The ancient Iron Age Hillfort is one of the historic highlights on the walk. It is located in a fine spot with views of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The route continues along The Ridgeway National Trail which will take you to Hackpen Hill where there is a White Horse hill figure with views over the Marlborough Downs. You continue south towards Overton Hill where you can visit two more ancient sites at the West Kennet Long Barrow and the famous Avebury Stones Circle. The next stage takes you to the Alton Barnes White Horse on the scenic Milk Hill. Near here you will also cross the noteworthy Wansdyke, a medieval defensive earthwork. You continue past Manningford Abbots, Upavon, Bulford and Durrington where there are some nice views of the River Avon. At Amesbury you can take a detour west from the route to visit the World famous Stonehenge. The walk continues south running parallel to the River Avon, passing Great Durnford and Old Sarum Castle on the outskirts of Salisbury. It's another significant location being the earliest settlement of the town. Shortly after you enter Salisbury, finishing near the wonderful cathedral.",
