  "description": "This expansive forest is located near Cookstown in the Sperrin Mountains of County Tyrone. There's miles of walking paths and mountain bike trails taking you through lush woodland with river views and lots of wildlife to look out for. The site includes some easier family trails as well as more challenging red graded mountain bike trails - see the video below to get an idea of what to expect on the exhilarating trail. Other facilities include a visitor centre, a car park, bike hire and a OM Dark Sky Park and Observatory. To continue your walking in the area head north to visit Banagher Glen Nature Reserve. Here you can explore the Banagher Dam and a series of pretty waterfalls with red squirrels to look out for on the way. To the west there's Gortin Glen where there's another red graded mountain bike trail and a series of waymarked footpaths to try. Near here there's also Loughmacrory Lough. Here you will find a  2km circular trail running along the shoreline of the pretty lake.",
