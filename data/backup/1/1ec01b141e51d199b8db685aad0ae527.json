  "description": "These woods in Leeds have walking trails and cycling trails suitable for mountain bikes. There's lots of good tracks with some decent jumps. The area also includes the adjacent Lodge Wood and West Wood with its walking trails taking you to bluebell woodland, an old walled garden and hidden grottoes. The woods are located next to the village of Calverley just south of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. You can pick up the walking and cycling trail along the canal to extend your outing. Following it west will take you towards Bradford while heading east takes you into Leeds. The Leeds Country Way also passes through the woods so you could pick up this long distance trail to explore the countryside around the city. The River Aire runs just to the north of the woods so you could follow the Airedale Way path into Leeds or towards Baildon Moor and Shipley Glen .",
