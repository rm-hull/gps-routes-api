The lake in this photo is called Heronry South Lake; no herons were in evidence on this occasion, but a swan can be seen in the shadow of the trees."

  "description": "This pretty town in Cambridgeshire has some lovely country and riverside walks to try. St Neots is the largest town in the county and an interesting place to visit. The town dates back over 1,000 years to the Medieval Priory of St. Neot and includes an award winning museum which is well worth a visit. This circular walk uses part of the Ouse Valley Way to visit the lovely Riverside Park and the nearby Paxton Pits Nature Reserve. The walk starts from St Neots Bridge and follows the waymarked Ouse Valley Way north through the attractive Lammas Meadows on the eastern side of the river. The river eventually winds its way round to Paxton Pits where there's a series of nice ponds and lakes. In all there's 200 acres to explore with habitats including meadow, reedbed, scrub and woodland. It's a great place for bird watching so be sure to bring your binoculars. After exploring the reserve the walk returns to St Neots Bridge on the same paths. You then pass through the Riverside Park on the western side of the river, just to the south of the bridge. Follow the paths south past the cricket ground to Eaton Socon where you cross the river at the pretty lock. You can then follow the Ouse Valley Way past Eynesbury before returning to the bridge. The town is located close to the popular Grafham Water where there's more waterside walks along the large lake. Near here you can also pick up the The Three Shires Way long distance trail. The waymarked footpath is a great way of exploring the countryside and villages to the east of the town.",
