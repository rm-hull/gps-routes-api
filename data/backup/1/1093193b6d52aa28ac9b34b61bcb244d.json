There are numerous caves on each side of the valley which were occupied by Neanderthal Man 40,000 years ago. The earliest remains of modern man known in Britain have also been discovered there, dating back 13,000 years to the last Ice Age. In more recent times, Creswell was once part of the Welbeck estate, and the Crags Pond was created by the Duke of Portland as a duck shooting lake."

  "description": "This walk takes you around this fascinating\u00a0limestone\u00a0gorge on the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire border. There's a lovely waterside footpath running along Crags Lake with views of the surrounding caves and cliffs. It's a well surfaced trail taking you up close to the remarkable geological features in the park. There is an excellent visitor centre with a museum detailing the history of the caves and fissures. You can see bones of\u00a0lynx, beaver and wild pig dating from the last Ice Age 9,500 years ago. There's also some fascinating Cave Art, with engravings and\u00a0bas-reliefs\u00a0found on the walls and ceilings of some of the caves as recently as 2013. It's a very important find as it had previously been thought that no British\u00a0cave art\u00a0existed. If you'd like to extend your walk you could pick up the Robin Hood Way which runs through the park. A few miles to the north you will find the lovely Whitwell Wood which has three waymarked walking trails to try. Just to the east of the crags you will find the lovely Welbeck Estate . Here you can follow the Robin Hood Way between the two pretty lakes and into the adjacent woodland. There's also a large deer park with resident white deer to look out for. You can reach the deer park by heading south east along the Robin Hood Way from the western end of Cresswell Crags.",
