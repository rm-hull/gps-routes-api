  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Loch Callater near Braemar in Aberdeenshire. The remote loch is a lovely place for peaceful walks in dramatic surroundings. You can follow circular trails around the loch though you may need waterproof boots for the whole circuit as there is a stream crossing at the end. There's a car park to the north at Auchallater where you can start the walk. You can park here and follow the Callater Burn south through Glen Callater to reach the loch. At the northern end of the loch there's the Callater Stable Walkers' Bothy where you can get some shelter in inclement weather. The Jocks Road long distance trail passes the loch. You could pick this up to explore Glen Clova and visit the stunning Corrie Fee Nature Reserve .",
