  "description": "This large park in Derby covers 320 acres and includes miles of good footpaths for walkers to try. In the park you will find a lovely large lake and peaceful woodland with nature trails. The park is also a nature reserve with lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for on your walk. Keep your eyes peeled for White letter hairstreak butterflies, Brown Hare and a variety of woodland birds. The park also includes the Grade II listed Allestree Hall. The 19th-century former country house has an interesting history and some pretty gardens to explore. There's also an 18 hole golf course with a cafe where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. To continue your walking in the Derby area you can head to the nearby Elvaston Castle Country Park. There's hundreds of acres of cycling and walking trails surrounding the 17th century Elvaston Castle. Also nearby is Kedleston Hall. This much larger park features grassy meadows, serpentine lakes, pleasure grounds, woodland and contoured hills. The long distance Bonnie Prince Charlie Walk also runs through the area so you could pick up the trail to further explore the Derbyshire countryside.",

Just to the south west if the hugely popular Markeaton Park. Just to the east you can pick up the Great Northern Greenway. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along the trackbed of the old Great Northern Railway which closed in the 1960s. It now makes for a nice easy cycle or walk and can be picked up from close to the Meteor Shopping Centre. For more walking ideas in the area see the Derbyshire Walks page."
