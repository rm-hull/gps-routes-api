  "description": "This pleasant town in Somerset has some interesting features including a hill top 16th century Dovecote and a 15th century packhorse bridge over the River Brue, which runs through the town. For walkers there's river trails, a couple of waymarked footpaths and the nearby Stourhead Estate to explore. This walk from the town takes you east along the Leland Trail to visit King Alfred's Tower and the stunning gardens at Stourhead. The walk starts on the River Brue in the town centre, just to the west of the train station and the remains of the Abbey. Here you pick up the Leland Trail and follow the waymarked footpath south through the town, passing the National Trust dovecote on the way. The route then heads out into the country, following paths south east to Discove and Redlynch. You then head due east until you reache a large woodland area where you turn north to climb to King Alfred's Tower. The Tower is named after King Alfred who raised his standard here in 870. The structure commemorates the accession of George III in 1760 and the end of the Severn Years War. You can climb the tower's 205 steps and admire the spectacular view of the three surrounding counties. After enjoying the views you continue south east through the woods to pick up the Stour Valley Way and following it to Stourhead. After exploring the parkland you head west through the woods to rejoin the Leland Trail. You can then follow this back to Bruton.",
