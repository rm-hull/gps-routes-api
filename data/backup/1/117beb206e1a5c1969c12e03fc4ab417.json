  "description": "Follow the Medlock Valley Way from Manchester City Centre to Bishop Park near Oldham on foot or take your bike for the first section to Clayton Vale . You start off near Piccadilly station and head east along the River Medlock, passing Manchester City Football Stadium and Phillips Park before entering a lovely section of parkland and woodland through Clayton Vale. The reserve is home to a number of excellent mountain bike trails run by the National Cycling Centre. The route continues past Droylsden and the pretty Daisy Nook Country Park with the final section taking you past the pretty reservoirs in Strinesdale Country Park to Bishop Park. This is a lovely, fairly easy waterside walk that takes you through some attractive parkland and woodland. There are also some splendid views of the surrounding countryside during the final ascents at Strines Dale and Bishop park. NB.The first part of the trail to Clayton Vale is open to cyclists forming part of regional route 86.",
