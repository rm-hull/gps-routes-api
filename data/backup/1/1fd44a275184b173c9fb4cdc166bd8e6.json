  "description": "Buriton is a very pretty quintessential English village located in East Hampshire, two miles south of Petersfield. In the village there's a particularly lovely village pond, picturesque cottages, a classic village pub and a fine old church. This circular walk from the village explores Queen Elizabeth Country Park before climbing to the popular viewpoint at Butser Hill . They are two of the highlights of this scenic area of the South Downs. The walk starts from the free car park by the village pond where you can pick up the Hangers Way and follow the waymarked footpath south west into Queen Elizabeth Country Park. There's miles of fine woodland and parkland trails here with a good visitor centre. After a mile or so in the park you turn north to head towards Butser Hill. The hill is the highest point on the chalk ridge of the\u00a0South Downs\u00a0and the second highest point in the\u00a0South Downs National Park\u00a0after\u00a0Blackdown\u00a0in the\u00a0Western Weald. On the hill there is a wide variety of flora and fine views over the surrounding area. After taking in the views on the hill you head north past Ramsdean Down before turning south east on a country lane which will lead you back into Buriton.",
