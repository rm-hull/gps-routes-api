  "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking trails around this large lake on Exmoor. There is a super walking trail running around the perimeter of the lake. You'll enjoy long waterside sections, many peaceful woodland trails and views of the River Haddeo. This route is the round the lake walk but there are also a number of cycle trails with cycle hire available too. The three well surfaced trails are great for riders of all abilites. The easy green graded trail runs for just over a mile adjacent to the lake. It's perfect for families looking for a safe traffic free ride. It's easy to extend your walk and explore the surrounding countryside. You could enjoy a riverside walk along the River Haddeo near Hartford or you could climb Haddon Hill at the southern end of the lake, and enjoy splendid views across Exmoor. The park has excellent facilites with a cafe, cycle hire and parking available. Wimbleball Lake is located a few miles east of Dulverton where you can visit the popular Tarr Steps. To continue your walking in the area you could head a few miles east and visit Clatworthy Reservoir near Wiveliscombe. Here you will find a great 5 mile walking trail around the perimeter of the lake. Just to the north you can also pick up the Samaritans Way South West and explore the Brendon Hills and Combe Sydenham Country Park .",
