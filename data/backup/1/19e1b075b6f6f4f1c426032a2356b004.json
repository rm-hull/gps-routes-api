  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around the riverside park in Newark on Trent on this easy walk in Nottinghamshire. There's much to see in this interesting and picturesque area including the Town Lock, Newark Castle, Trent Bridge and the Millgate Museum. The walk starts from the parking area at the riverside park but you could also start from the nearby Newark Castle railway station. The park has nice footpaths taking along the river to the Town Lock. Here you will find a nice sensory garden and lots of old buildings which have now been converted into cafes and shops. The walk then crosses the river and heads to Newark Castle. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and includes a ruined gatehouse dating from the 12th century. It's in a lovely riverside location with quiet Victorian gardens and access to the castle's walls and dungeons. After exploring the castle the walk then crosses the Trent Bridge to return you to the riverside park and the finish point of the walk. The Trent Valley Way long distance trail runs through the town. You could pick up the path and follow it towards Nottingham and visit the Attenborough Nature Reserve and the Beeston Canal. Also near the town is Stapleford Woods where there's miles of nice trails to try.",

      "content": "Just to the east of the town is the little country village of Coddington. Here you will find the Inn on the Green which is a great choice for some post walk refreshments out of the town. Now very much at the heart of Coddington village, The Inn on The Green was once part of a farm and maltings complex that fronted the Green. In 1948 it was put up for sale and was subsequently converted to a Country Club. The licence was changed in the 1970s and since then it has been a pub and restaurant, serving the local community and beyond. There's a very good menu and a nice outdoor seating area for warmer days. You can find the pub on Main Street with a postcode of NG24 2PS for your sat navs. Head north along the river and you can visit Collingham and Cromwell Lock. The noteworthy lock includes one of the largest weirs on the Trent which marks the tidal limit of the river. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nottinghamshire Walks page."
