  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Lough Fea in the Sperrin Mountains of Northern Ireland. There is a car park and a picnic area at the northern end of the lake where you can start your walk. From here you can pick up the 4km circular trail and enjoy some wonderful views over the water to the surrounding mountains. The lough is located just east of the expansive Davagh Forest where you can enjoy miles of walking and cycling trails."
