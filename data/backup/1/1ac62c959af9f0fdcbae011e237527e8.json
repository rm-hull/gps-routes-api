  "description": "This circular walk visits Pontefract Park in this pleasant West Yorkshire market town. The walk starts just to the north of the town near to Tanshelf Station. From her you can pick up footpaths heading north around the park. The north section of the park is also classified as a Local Nature Reserve, with habitats including grassland, a lake, woodland, wetland and small areas of open water. It's a pleasant place for a stroll and you should also see some wildlife around the lake. Other public footpaths branch out to the east towards Featherstone if you'd like to extend the walk.",

      "content": "A couple of miles north of the park you'll find the Fairburn Ings Nature Reserve near Allerton Bywater and Castleford. It's a nice place to extend your walking with a number of pretty lakes and nice riverside paths along the River Aire. You could also pick up the Wakefield Canal in Castleford and enjoy a waterside walk along the towpath. Brockadale Nature Reserve is a lovely peaceful place where you can go for an easy walk near the town. Here you'll find woodland, wildflower meadows, views of the River Went and lots of wildlife."
