  "description": "This circular walk visits Pontefract Park in this pleasant West Yorkshire market town. The walk starts just to the north of the town near to Tanshelf Station. From her you can pick up footpaths heading north around the park. The north section of the park is also classified as a Local Nature Reserve, with habitats including grassland, a lake, woodland, wetland and small areas of open water. It's a pleasant place for a stroll and you should also see some wildlife around the lake. Other public footpaths branch out to the east towards Featherstone if you'd like to extend the walk.",
