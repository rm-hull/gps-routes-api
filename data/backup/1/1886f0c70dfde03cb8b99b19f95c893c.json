  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the pretty Loch Humphrey on this walk in the Kilpatrick Hills. The loch is a very peaceful place for a walk with fine views of the surrounding hills and the nearby Clyde Estuary. There's also some woodland trails on the southern side of the water and a series of smaller lochs nearby. You can find the loch a few miles north east of Dumbarton, near to Duncolm and Clydebank. The loch is also a popular spot for Perch fishing and occasional trout by members of the Bearsden Angling Club, who have a boat and a boatshed at the loch.",
