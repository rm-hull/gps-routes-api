  "description": "This circular walk follows the Mamhead Sensory Trail in Haldon Forest Park. The popular family trail runs for about 1.5 miles along a well maintained path.  You can start off at the free Mamhead car park where there's also a picnic area. On the walk you'll pass the photogenic Mamhead obelisk and enjoy some great views to Exmouth from the elevated position of the wood. Just to the east of the trail there's also the historic Mamhead House to see. It's Grade I listed and dates back to 1827.",
