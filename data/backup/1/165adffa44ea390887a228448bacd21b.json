  "description": "This circular walk follows the Mamhead Sensory Trail in Haldon Forest Park. The popular family trail runs for about 1.5 miles along a well maintained path. You can start off at the free Mamhead car park where there's also a picnic area. On the walk you'll pass the photogenic Mamhead obelisk and enjoy some great views to Exmouth from the elevated position of the wood. Just to the east of the trail there's also the historic Mamhead House to see. It's Grade I listed and dates back to 1827.",

The fine looking castle dates from 1788 and is surrounded by some the lovely grounds and gardens. See the Doddiscombsleigh Walk for more details. Just a few miles to the south west you'll find some more pleasant trails around Ideford Common. There's some attractive woodland, heathland and grassland here with the opportunity to spot Dartford Warblers and nightjars."
