  "description": "The popular market town of Henley-on-Thames has a number of excellent waymarked trails to try. The riverside town is a very pretty place and home to the famous Henley Regatta. The rowing event takes place every year over the first weekend in July. Look out for the Grade I listed Henley Bridge as you make your way through the town. The five arched bridge across the river thames was built in 1786. The  parish church of St Mary the Virgin dates from the 16th-century while the The Old Bell dates from 1325.  The town can be accessed by train from Twyford and there are direct trains from London Paddington in peak hours. This long circular walk makes use of the Thames Path, the Chiltern Way and the Oxfordshire Way to take you on a tour of the countryside surrounding the town. These three long distance footpaths all pass close to the town. They are a good way of exploring the area as they are waymarked and of a good quality. The walk starts in the town centre near the river and follows the Thames Path south to Bolney Court. This section passes Park Place, Marsh Lock weir and Ferry Eyot island. Here you turn west along the Chiltern Way and head towards the village of Binfield Heath via Harpsden Wood. You then turn north and head past the woodland of the BBC owned Crowsley Park estate. From the public footpaths there are views of Crowsley Park House, a Grade II listed 18th century mansion house. After leaving Crowsley Park you continue north to the splendidly named Rotherfield Peppard village. Here you will find the lovely Peppard Common which has nice walking trails through woodland, lowland heath and grassland. The walk continues through the fringe of Nettlebed Woods before turning south along a section of the Oxfordshire Way. This takes you past the villages of Bix and Middle Assendon before coming to Henley Park. Shortly after you return to the town and the finish point.",
