  "description": "This pretty village is located near Chorley in the county of Lancashire. It's a nice place to start a walk with woods, canals and nearby reservoirs to visit on foot. The village is also close to the West Pennine Moors where there are numerous hiking and cycling trails to try. This walk takes you south along The Goit Canal to the nearby Anglezarke Reservoir. The walk starts in the village and heads south along a pleasant waterside path running along side the Goit Canal. You'll pass the Hatch Brook Waterfall and the picturesque White Coppice where there's a cricket field and a series of small reservoirs to see. The walk continues south past the woodland and waterfalls at Strontstrey Bank before coming to the expansive Anglezarke Reservoir. Here you enter the Rivington Estate where you can explore Rivington Country Park, Rivington Pike and Rivington Reservoir .",
