  "description": "This circular walk visits the pretty Lochan Mor near Loch an Eilein in the Cairngorms National Park. You can start the walk from the public parking area on the northern side of Loch an Eilein. Then follow trails north east towards the croft before continuing north west to visit Lochan Mor. It's a lovely secluded and peaceful spot with the small lake surrounded by attractive woodland. There's also some glorious views over the water to the surrounding Cairngorms mountains as well. From the lake you head west to Milton cottage before following a country lane south to return to the car park.",
