  "description": "Travel through Hampshire from Alton to the Queen Elizabeth Country Park along this 21 mile walking path. The route passes through the delightful village of Selborne where you can take a detour to visit the lovely Selborne Common. There's nice footpaths here and varierty of flora and fauna to see. The village is also notable for its links with the world-famous naturalist, Revd. Gilbert White, who was a pioneer of birdwatching. White is recognised as being the first ecologist or environmentalist. From Selborne you continue to Noar Hill and the attractive market town of Petersfield before finishing at Queen Elizabeth Country Park. Scenery includes the beautiful woodland and grassland of the Hampshire countryside, while passing a series of steep-sided hills called the Hampshire Hangers, from which the path takes its name. See the Hampshire CC website for more information on walks in the area.",
