  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the Cwm Clydach National Nature Reserve near Swansea. On the way you'll see some lovely scenery with bluebell woodland, pretty waterfalls and lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for birdlife including wood warblers, grey wagtails, dippers and spotted flycatchers. In winter, buzzards, red kites and ravens can be also be seen. The walk starts in the large village of Clydach located some 6 miles (9.7 km) north east of Swansea city centre. From here you can pick up public footpaths heading north along the River Clydach to the reserve. The circular trail then takes you through the woodland trails of the reserve before returning to the start. The Swansea Canal starts in Clydach so you could pick this up and head towards Pontardawe to continue your waterside walking in the area.",
