  "description": "Enjoy a short hike above this pretty reservoir in the Mourne Mountains. The reservoir was constructed between 1953 and 1957 and supplies water for County Down, the surrounding counties and most of Belfast. Start the walk from the reservoir wall at the southern end. You can catch shuttle busses to here from the Silent Valley. From the top of the wall there are wonderful views to Silent Valley, Slievenaglogh Mountain and Ben Crom Mountain. You can then follow a path east to climb to a fine viewpoint over the water. The path will then lead you up to the pretty Blue Lough before descending back down to the reservoir. To continue your reservoir walking in the Mourne Mountains head south to visit the Silent Valley Reservoir. There's lovely woodland trails to follow along the River Kilkeel with smaller ornamental lakes to enjoy as well. Also nearby is Spelga Dam. There's waterside trails along the lake shore at the southern end of the reservoir with a nice picnic area at the northern end.",
