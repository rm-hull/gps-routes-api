      "content": "The parish is steeped in a rich and lengthy history, dating back to Neolithic times. In the 12th century, Henry I distinguished Lodsworth as a \"liberty\" village, granting its residents unique rights that almost completely freed them from the feudal system. Oliver Cromwell is historically noted to have visited the village during the Civil War. Key attractions include St Peter's Church in Lodsworth, established in the 13th century and featuring a 14th-century tower. The churchyard is the resting place of E H Shepard, famed illustrator of \"Winnie the Pooh\" and \"The Wind in the Willows,\" and his last home in the village is marked with a plaque. Additionally, St James' Church in Selham is a small yet historically significant place of worship. The Manor House, located near the church in Lodsworth, has a medieval origin and was once owned by the Bishop of London. St Peter's Well in Lodsworth is also known as a medieval pilgrimage site."
