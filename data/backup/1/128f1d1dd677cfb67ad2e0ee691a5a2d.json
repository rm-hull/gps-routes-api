The farmer's vehicle is a Daihatsu Sport-Trak, a small 4*4 from the 1990s. An excellent vehicle in the snow and mud and economical to run, from an era before the owners of ridiculously over-sized \"Chelsea Tractors\" were scorned for their gas-guzzling and polluting habits. There is also a telecommunications mast at the top of the hill."

  "description": "This circular walk visits Black Rocks in the Peak District National Park. The rocks are a striking gritstone outcrop surrounded by the woodland of Cromford Moor. There are wonderful views of the Derwent Valley from the rocks which are in an elevated position above the town of Cromford. The walk starts by the Cromford Canal and follows the High Peak Trail to Black Rocks. You then head across Cromford Moor with its woodland trails and heather moorland. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area you could enjoy a waterside walk along the Cromford Canal. You could also head west along the High Peak Trail to visit Middleton Top. Here you'll find an excellent visitor centre with good facilities and a wealth of information on the area. There's also the historic Middleton Top Engine House, built in 1829 and fabulous views down to the nearby Carsington Water .",
