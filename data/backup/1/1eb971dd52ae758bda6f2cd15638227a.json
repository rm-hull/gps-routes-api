Very few were made during the war, with only 10 towers like these in the UK still standing. The Holton Heath anti-aircraft gun towers were built to help protect the nearby Royal Navy Cordite Factory from enemy bombers during World War 2."

  "description": "This Dorset based village is located just to the north east of Wareham . This walk from the village explores Holton or Sandford Heath which is located right next to the village. The heath has some pleasant walking trails, peaceful woodland and the photogenic Bofors Towers. This rare WW2 anti aircraft battlement is surrounded by pretty heather in the late summer, making for a fine picture. You can continue your walking by heading north east to explore the Holton Heath Nature Reserve where there's more nice trails and wildlife to see. Heading south west would take you into Wareham where you could enjoy walks along the River Frome and around the pretty lake in the Bestwall Park Nature Reserve. You can also pick up the Purbeck Way long distance footpath in this area.",
