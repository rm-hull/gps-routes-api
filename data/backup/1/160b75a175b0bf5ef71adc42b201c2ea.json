According to legend, the fort stands on the very spot where a Spanish pirate once built a castle, marking the beginning of centuries of historical significance. Its enduring fame was sealed during a crucial moment in Irish history over three hundred years ago when it became the scene of the final stand of Irish royalist forces against Cromwellian troops in 1652. With its unique star-shaped design from the 17th century, the fort not only reflects the challenges of the past but also stands as a symbol of Inishbofin's resilience."
