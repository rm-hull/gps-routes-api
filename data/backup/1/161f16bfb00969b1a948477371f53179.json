  "description": "This walk visits Melford Country Park in the village of Long Melford in Suffolk. The park is located just south of the village and includes pleasant footpaths taking you around lakes and woodland. There's also nice views of the surrounding countryside and the River Stour which flows through the area. In the park you can pick up the Sudbury Railway Walk to extend your exercise. This will take you south along the now disused railway to Sudbury on a shared cycling and walking trail. Here you could explore the lovely Sudbury Water Meadows where there's river trails and lots of wildlife to see. Also nearby is the historic Melford Hall with its beautiful landscaped gardens and 15th century church.",
