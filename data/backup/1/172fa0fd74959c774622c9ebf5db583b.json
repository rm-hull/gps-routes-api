  "description": "This attractive Derbyshire Dales village is a fine place to begin a walk. The former leading mining village includes a number of quaint stone cottages, a noteworthy 13th century church and two fine local pubs. The settlement is located just to the south west of Matlock. The village is on the Limestone Way, a long distance walking trail, ideal for exploring the wonderful limestone scenery typical of the area. This short circular walk takes you around the village and through the scenic Bonsall Dale. There's some splendid views of the surrounding Peak District hills from the elevated dale. See the list of walks below for more ideas and the Peak District Walks page for more walks in the national park.",
