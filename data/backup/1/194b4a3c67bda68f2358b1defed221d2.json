  "description": "This attractive town sits in a beautiful spot on the north east coast of Anglesey. Amlwch is notable as a significant former mining port with a rich industrial heritage. You can learn all about this at the Copper Kingdom visitor centre in Port Almwch which sits in a fine location next to the picturesque harbour. Just a couple of miles south there's also the climb to Parys Mountain where you can explore the old disused copper mines and enjoy some wonderful views of the town and coast. This walk from the town takes you along the coast to visit the lighthouse and viewpoint at Point Lynas. It's a lovely section of the coast with rock formations and great views from the cliff tops. The walk starts in Port Amlwch where you can enjoy a lovely walk along the harbour on the Anglesey Coast Path. You'll pass Amlwch Lighthouse before heading east along the coast to Llam Carw and Porth Eilian at Llaneilian. Here you turn north to follow footpaths towards the Point Lynas lighthouse on the end of the headland. The lighthouse dates back to the 1700s and consists of an operational tower, the Head Keeper\u2019s house and two Keepers\u2019 cottages. The cottages are available to rent so you could stay in this stunning location and enjoy views across the Irish Sea from your property.",
