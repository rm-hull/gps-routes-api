  "description": "Climb to Lad Law, the 1,696 ft (517 m) summit of Boulsworth Hill on this challenging walk in the South Pennines. The walk starts in the historically fascinating village of Wycoller and makes use of the Bronte Way and the Pendle Way footpaths to take you to Boulsworth Dyke where you begin the serious climbing to the hill summit. The views are far reaching with the Lake District Peaks, the Peak District, Pendle Hill and Blackpool Tower all visible on a clear day. You then descend via Bedding Hill Moor and return to Wycoller on the same paths. It's a fine walk with some wonderful moorland scenery and a nice waterside section along the Wycoller Beck at the start. The beck is crossed with ancient Clapper and Pack-horse bridges one of which is over 1,000 years old. You'll also pass the ruined Wycoller Hall thought to be the inspiration for 'Ferndean Manor' in Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre. If you would like to extend your walk you could head to the nearby Widdop Reservoir .",
