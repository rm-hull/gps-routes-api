There is clear evidence of the ridged strips of Saxon fields, but with the coming of William the Conqueror the area was transferred into Norman ownership. In 1392 Thomas de Lyons was granted a licence to enclose his lands and make a park, the foundation of the modern one."

He and his descendants gradually enlarged, rebuilt, remodelled and reconstructed various parts of the house. In 1939 it was requisitioned by the War Office, used in turn as a Transit Camp, RAF HQ and American Army Command HQ. The last Smyth owner died in 1946 and for 13 years the house, already in disrepair, lay empty. When the City Council bought the Estate much expensive work had to be carried out. Gradually considerable conservation and restoration has been achieved and is still continuing."

  "description": "A short circular walk around one of England's most popular country parks in Long Ashton, Somerset. The Ashton Court Estate is located near Bristol and is comprised of 850 acres of woodland, parkland and gardens. Highlights include Ashton Court Meadow nature reserve which contains a wide range of flowering plants. There is also a deer park and Clarken Combe - a woodland area with a range of plant species. The park is also good for cycling with National Cycle Route 33, known as the Festival Way running through the park. In the park there are two very good mountain bike trails. There is a blue (moderate) grade route with small rock steps, rollers (bumps) and berms (banked corners). There's also a more difficult red graded route for experienced mountain bikers.",

      "content": "The estate includes the courtyard cafe which sells a good range of meals and snacks. If you prefer a pub lunch you could head into nearby Long Ashton and visit the historic Angel Inn. The late 15th century pub has a cosy interior with large fires for colder days. Outside there's a marquee which is illuminated with stunning fairy lights. They serve good quality food and a good selection of drinks. You can find the pub at postcode BS41 9LT for your sat navs. The inn is Dog Friendly."

      "content": "The National Trust village of Failand is just to the west of the estate. There's a nice circular walk to try here taking you to the local bluebell woods and the delightful Abbots Pool. Tyntesfield House is also nearby and well worth a visit. The Community Forest Path runs past the site. The long distance trail takes you on a tour of some of the walking highlights surrounding the city of Bristol. A couple of miles to the south west you will find the circular walk around the Barrow Gurney Reservoirs. The reservoirs are an excellent place for a peaceful stroll with lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks page."
