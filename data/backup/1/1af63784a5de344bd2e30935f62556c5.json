There is clear evidence of the ridged strips of Saxon fields, but with the coming of William the Conqueror the area was transferred into Norman ownership. In 1392 Thomas de Lyons was granted a licence to enclose his lands and make a park, the foundation of the modern one."

He and his descendants gradually enlarged, rebuilt, remodelled and reconstructed various parts of the house. In 1939 it was requisitioned by the War Office, used in turn as a Transit Camp, RAF HQ and American Army Command HQ. The last Smyth owner died in 1946 and for 13 years the house, already in disrepair, lay empty.\nWhen the City Council bought the Estate much expensive work had to be carried out. Gradually considerable conservation and restoration has been achieved and is still continuing."

  "description": "A short circular walk around one of England's most popular country parks in Long Ashton , Somerset. The Ashton Court Estate is located near Bristol and is comprised of 850 acres of woodland, parkland and gardens. Highlights include Ashton Court Meadow nature reserve which contains a wide range of flowering plants. There is also a deer park and Clarken Combe - a woodland area with a range of plant species. The park is also good for cycling with National Cycle Route 33 , known as the Festival Way running through the park. In the park there are two very good mountain bike trails. There is a blue (moderate) grade route with small rock steps, rollers (bumps) and berms (banked corners). There's also a more difficult red graded route for experienced mountain bikers.",
