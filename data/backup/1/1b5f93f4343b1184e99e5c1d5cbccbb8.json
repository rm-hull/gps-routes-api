  "description": "This circular walk takes you to from Winchcombe to Cleeve Hill, the highest point in the Cotswolds Hills. The route uses a section of the Cotswold Way National Trail to take you up to the hill before following other public footpaths back to the town. The route runs for a distance of about 10 miles with a fairly challenging hill climb on the way. You'll also pass the noteworthy ancient long barrow of Belas Knap and enjoy views of the River Isbourne on the way. The walk starts from the southern side of the town, near to the tourist information centre and Almsbury Farm. From here you can pick up the Cotswold Way and follow it south to Wadfield Farm and Belas Knap. The fascinating scheduled ancient monument dates from around 3000 BC and includes a false entrance and independently accessible side chambers. From the long barrow you head west to Wotfield Farm before coming to Cleeve Hill. The summit stands at a height of 1,083 feet (330 m) commanding fine views over Cheltenham racecourse, the River Severn, the Cotswolds Hills and back to the town of Winchcombe. The route then turns north west, skirting the edge of Nutterswood and Thrift Wood before coming to Woodmancote. The trail then heads east past the golf course towards old Postlip Hall where you pick up the Isbourne Way. This trail takes you along the River Isbourne back to Winchcombe where the route finishes.",
