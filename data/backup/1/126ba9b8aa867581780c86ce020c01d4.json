  "description": "A walk along the Grand Union Canal from Brentford to Minet Country Park and Lake Farm Country Park in Hillingdon. Start the walk from Brentford Dock and the marina in Brentford. It's located just to the south of the train station and on the opposite side of the Thames from Kew Gardens. From the marina you head west towards Syon Park where there's 200-acres of parkland and gardens to explore. The canal then bends round to the north west towards Hanwell and Norwood Green. You'll pass close to Osterley Park where there's some lovely parkland and gardens to explore. From Norwood Green the walk heads west through North Hyde to Hillingdon where you will pass Minet Country Park. The park includes ponds, grassland and a variety of wild plants and flowers. You can also pick up the long distance Hillingdon Trail here and follow it towards the pretty Yeadling Brook. This route continues west to Hayes where it finishes at Lake Farm Country Park. Here you can enjoy meadows, open grassland and a trim trail.",

It is named after the pretty Lesser Celandine flowers you can see on the walk. Just to the north there's leafy Ealing where there's nice trails around Ealing Common and the historic Walpole Park."
