  "description": "This fine, lakeside walk takes you from one end of Ullswater to the other. It's about a 10 mile walk, taking in some of the best scenery of the Lake District. Along the way you'll pass peaceful woods, rushing waterfalls, pretty becks and spectacular mountains. The walk is generally fairly easy going but there are some small climbs along the way. The walk starts from the village of Pooley Bridge, located at the north eastern end of the lake. The first section heads south along the lake to Sharrow Bay, passing underneath Barton Fell on the way. At Sharrow Bay you can visit the country house, enjoy refreshments and explore the beautiful formal gardens. The route continues to Howton where you can catch the famous 'Ullswater Steamers' which will take you across the lake. At the little hamlet there is also the option of climbing Hallin Fell for wonderful views across the water to the surrounding fells. The route continues through Hallinhag Wood and Sandwick, crossing the Boredale Beck as you go. You then pass the Scalehow Waterfall before coming to Birk Fell and Silver Bay. You continue south to the village of Patterdale , passing the Devil's Chimney and Blowick Bay on the way. This section passes under Patterdale Common and Place Fell, which is another great viewpoint. The final section takes you through Patterdale, crossing the Grisedale Bridge over the Grisedale Beck before heading past the woodland under Raven Crag and finishing at Glenridding. You can extend the walk by continuing round the lake to the popular Aira Force . The lovely waterfall is surrounded by attractive woodland with great views to be found in the adjacent Gowbarrow Park.",
