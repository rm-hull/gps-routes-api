  "description": "This charming Sussex based village has some nice thatched cottages, a Grade I listed Saxon Church and a century-old cricket pitch where W. G. Grace played. The ancient settlement also has a rich literary history. Mervyn Peake and his family lived here and he walked the South Downs while devising the fantasy characters of Gormenghast. This circular walk from the village visits neighbouring Arundel , North Stoke and Amberley . On the way you'll enjoy long riverside stretches along the River Arun. Highlights on the way include the historic Arundel Castle, Arundel Cathedral and Arundel Priory. The castle includes beautiful gardens, exquisite furniture, tapestries and a rare collection of paintings, though there is a fee for entry to the grounds. It also has a fascinating history dating back to 1067 and some of the original features such as the Norman Keep, medieval Gatehouse and Barbican survive today. Part of the walk uses a section of the epic Monarch's Way while you can also pick up The South Downs Way National Trail just north of the settlement near Amberley.",
