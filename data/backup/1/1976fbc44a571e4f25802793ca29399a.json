  "description": "The town of Aviemore is a great place for exploring a beautiful region of the Cairngorms National Park. In the area you will find numerous lochs, forests, mountains and rivers. This walk from the town, follows a section of the Speyside Way to take you to Kincraig. On the way you'll visit Loch Alvie and Loch Insh with views of the River Spey to enjoy. There's also some attractive woodland sections through the Kinrara estate. The Craigellachie Nature Reserve is very close to the town and a great option for walkers. Just head west from the town and you will soon come to the reserve which includes waymarked paths, several small lochs, woodland trails and stunning views of the Cairngorms. Loch an Eilein can be found just to the south of the town. There's a nice footpath around the loch which is in a beautiful and tranquil location with the still waters surrounded by stunning hills and mountains. The Speyside Way long distance trail is another great option. You can follow the trail north to Boat of Garten and visit the Osprey Centre Nature Reserve next to Loch Garten in the Abernethy Forest . This includes the Osprey Centre where you can observe the birds nesting in the Caledonian pineforest and view the birds on the live CCTV camera. Near here there's also the smaller Loch Vaa which has particularly beautiful clear waters. A few miles to the east is the expansive Glenmore Forest Park . Here you can visit Loch Morlich and look out for wildlife including Scottish Crossbill,\u00a0Crested Tit,\u00a0Capercaillie\u00a0and\u00a0Red Deer. There's also the hike to the unusually coloured Green Loch to try here. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Aviemore. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
