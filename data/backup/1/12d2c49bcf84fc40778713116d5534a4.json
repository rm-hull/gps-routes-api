  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Roughrigg Reservoir near Airdrie. The reservoir is a popular place for fishing and also has some pleasant walking trails along the old railway track beds that surround the site. There's some pleasant grassy paths with nice views to the surrounding hills and countryside. To continue your walking in the area you could head north to pick up the Airdrie to Bathgate Cycle Path and visit the nearby Hillend Reservoir where there's more nice waterside trails.",
