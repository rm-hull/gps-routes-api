  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Sunbiggin Tarn in Cumbria. You can reach the tarn from the nearby village of Newbiggin On Lune. From here you follow the waymarked Dales High Way north west across Ravenstonedale Moor to the tarn. The small lake sits in a remote and scenic location with fine views to the surrounding Howgill Fells. It is also a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which includes the surrounding moorland and limestone pavement. As such you can look out for a variety of interesting plants and wildlife such as wigeon, black-headed gull, gadwall, little grebe, osprey, starling and water rail. To continue your walking in the area head to the nearby Smardale Gill Viaduct. The area includes a National Nature Reserve with wildlflowers, woodland and grassland.",
