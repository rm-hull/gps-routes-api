  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Lough Owel near Mullingar in County Westmeath. There's a good sized public car park at the southern end of the lake, near to the Pitch and Putt golf. From here you can enjoy a short stroll east along the lakeshore with fine views across the crystal clear waters. The lake is popular with swimmers and there is also a nice picnic area to relax in. On the eastern side of the lake you'll find Scragh Bog. There's a looped walking trail here with boardwalks and lots of interesting flora and fauna.",

The house includes lakeside trails, woodland, sculptures, a fairy garden and a Victoria Walled Garden. There's also some wonderful ruined follies including the eye catching Jealous Wall. The Athlone - Mullingar Greenway also starts in nearby Mullingar. The shared cycling and walking trail will take you along the old railway line to Athlone via Moate."
