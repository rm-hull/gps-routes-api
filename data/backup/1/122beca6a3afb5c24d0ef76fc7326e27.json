  "description": "Explore some of the finest countryside and prettiest towns and villages in this fascinating county. The path is circular, visiting Ashridge Forest, St Albans, Hertford, Codicote, Tring, Kings Langley , Cuffley and Bishop's Stortford Canal and River Walk . There's also some lovely scenery to enjoy with much of the walk taking place with the Chiltern Hills in the background. Places of interest include the beautiful Ashridge Estate near Berkhamsted (video below) and Shaw's Corner - the former residence of playwright Bernard Shaw located at Ayot St Lawrence , near Welwyn. You'll also pass through the pretty Royston Heath where there are fine views over the Cam Valley from Therfield Hill. The Friends of the Hertfordshire way have split the walk into the following manageable sections, each of about 12 miles in length:",
