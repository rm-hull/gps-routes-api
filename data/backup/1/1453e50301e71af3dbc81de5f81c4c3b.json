  "description": "This walk visits Loch Frisa on the Isle of Mull, Inner Hebrides. The walk starts from the car park in the forested area in Glen Aros. From here you can pick up a shared walking and cycling trail heading north west towards the loch. You can then follow a footpath running along the northern side of the loch with fine views across the water to the surrounding hills and mountains. Also look out for wildlife including ponies, hen harriers and white tailed eagles as you make your way through this peaceful area. To continue your walking in the area head north to pick up the Tobermory Lighthouse Walk. The historic village is a delightful place for a stroll with a picturesque harbour and several brightly painted buildings.",
