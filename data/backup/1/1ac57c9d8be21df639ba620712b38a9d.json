Founded in 1270AD, the Cistercian Monastery was originally a Benedictine abbey, founded in 1266, with the Benedictines being allegedly forced out by the Archbishop at the time, who dreamt that they plotted to murder him."

  "description": "This walk visits two wonderful historical sites in the town of Cashel, County Tipperary. Perched atop a striking limestone ridge in the Golden Vale, the Rock of Cashel is renowned for its historical importance and houses Ireland's most remarkable collection of medieval structures. The site includes a variety of monuments such as a round tower, a high cross, a Romanesque chapel, a Gothic cathedral, an abbey, the Hall of the Vicars Choral, and a Tower House dating back to the fifteenth century. From the elevated position there are wonderful views over the surrounding hills and countryside. The walk also visits the nearby Hore Abbey which lies just to the west of the Rock. The abbey is a spectacular ruin to visit, and is visible from the Rock of Cashel. It is a National Monument of Ireland, largely owing to its location near the famous rock, and its immense beauty. To continue your walking around Cashel head to visit another local historical highlight at Cahir Castle. Here you will find a 12th century fortress wonderfully positioned on an island in the river Suir. The castle grounds and the town are a lovely place for a stroll in the area. The town and the castle can be reached from Cashel by picking up the Tipperary Heritage Way, a waymarked long distance walk following the course of the River Suir through the county.",

      "content": "Historical Information:Originally serving as the stronghold of the Munster kings, legend has it that St. Patrick visited this site to convert King Aenghus to Christianity. Brian Boru was crowned High King at Cashel in 978 and established it as his capital. In 1101, the site was ceded to the church, leading to Cashel's rapid ascension as a pivotal centre of religious power in Ireland. The extant structures are extraordinary. For instance, Cormac\u2019s Chapel houses the only Romanesque frescoes still in existence in Ireland. The Rock of Cashel stands as one of Ireland\u2019s most stunning and rightfully popular tourist destinations."
