  "description": "This little village in Somerset has a noteworthy 15th century church and some nice country trails to try. It's also close to the Mendip Hills and the Cranborne Chase AONB where there are numerous footpaths to enjoy. This circular walk from the village explores the countryside to the south and also visits the neighbouring village of Bourton. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Monarch's Way and follow the waymarked footpath south east towards Bourton. Here you could pick up the Stour Valley Way and follow it north to visit one of the highlights of the area at the wonderful Stourhead. This route follows country lanes and public footpaths north west to return to Penselwood.",
