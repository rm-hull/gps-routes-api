  "description": "This circular walk visits the Arten Gill Viaduct in Dentdale in Cumbria. The 11 arch structure is in a scenic location, surrounded by some stunning Dales countryside. It dates from the Victorian period, is grade II listed and a scheduled monument. The walk starts from Dent Rail Station north of the viaduct, on the Settle and Carlisle Line. From here you can pick up a section of the Dales Way and follow it south to visit the viaduct. Here you pick up the Pennine Bridleway and follow the shared cycling and walking route east along the waters of the pretty Artengill Beck. You then loop round past Dent Fell and Green Bank before following a country lane west back to the rail station. From the high points on the walk there are some glorious views over the surrounding Yorkshire Dales and of the viaduct itself. You can extend the walk by continuing south to visit the Dent Head Viaduct .",
