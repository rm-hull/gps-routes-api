  "description": "This circular walk visits the Arten Gill Viaduct in Dentdale in Cumbria. The 11 arch structure is in a scenic location, surrounded by some stunning Dales countryside. It dates from the Victorian period, is grade II listed and a scheduled monument. The walk starts from Dent Rail Station north of the viaduct, on the Settle and Carlisle Line. From here you can pick up a section of the Dales Way and follow it south to visit the viaduct. Here you pick up the Pennine Bridleway and follow the shared cycling and walking route east along the waters of the pretty Artengill Beck. You then loop round past Dent Fell and Green Bank before following a country lane west back to the rail station. From the high points on the walk there are some glorious views over the surrounding Yorkshire Dales and of the viaduct itself. You can extend the walk by continuing south to visit the Dent Head Viaduct .",

      "content": "The creation of the Settle-Carlisle Railway represented a remarkable engineering challenge in English railway history, particularly evident in upper Dentdale. Here, the railway emerges from the Blea Moor Tunnel and spans across two impressive viaducts: Arten Gill and Dent Head. Arten Gill Viaduct, the larger of the two, showcases the use of Dent 'marble' \u2013 a stone quarried nearby, now no longer in use. This Dent stone, chosen for its ornamental qualities and rich fossil content, gives the viaduct its distinctive appearance. The structure gracefully arcs over Arten Gill Beck, integrating seamlessly into the landscape. Arten Gill Viaduct gained a touch of cinematic fame when it appeared in a scene from the movie \u201cMiss Potter,\u201d the Beatrix Potter biopic starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. In the film, the character travels from London to the Lake District, crossing this viaduct, though such a journey wouldn't typically pass this route in reality."
