The Saddle Knob is the grassy slope, with an old quarry at its foot. In the background is the much bigger Betchworth Quarry - until a few years ago its white cliff was a landmark for miles around. Now only the top shows, the rest having been used as a large landfill, now landscaped and being managed to make new downland. In the very far distance is White Downs. Box Hill, perhaps the most famous part of this stretch of the North Downs, is not visible, lying around the corner beyond Betchworth Quarry."

      "content": "On Reigate Hill you'll find the National Trust's Reigate Hill Tea Rooms. The cafe is in a fabulous elevated position with a number of picnic tables where you can sit outside and soak in the views of the Weald and Gatwick Airport. There's a good range of snacks and it's also very reasonably priced. The Rising Sun in Otford is another good option. They have a fantastic garden area with fine views over the North Downs countryside. It's a great spot to relax in on fine summer days. You can find the pub just to the west of the village on Twitton Lane with a postcode of TN14 5JS for your sat navs. The pub is also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you. The Robin Hood in Blue Bell Hill village is an interesting pub worthy of some investigation. The pub dates back over 700 years and includes a charming interior with a wood burner for colder days. Outside there's a lovely garden area with BBQ facilities during the warmer months. You can find the pub on Common Road with a postcode of ME5 9RJ for your sat navs. The pub welcomes dogs outside and in the bar area. In the Surrey town of Godalming there's a couple of worthy options to consider for a pit stop. The historic Star Inn dates back to the 1700s and includes and charming 'Olde Worlde' interior. They serve very good food which you can enjoy in a lovely garden area on warmer days. You can find them at 17 Church Street with postcode GU7 1EL for your sat navs. The Inn on the Lake is another good choice in the town. There's a particularly lovely garden here and a great Sunday roast. You can find them on the Ockford Road at postcode GU7 1RH. They are dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you. In the village of Hollingbourne make a pit stop at the splendidly named Dirty Habit. It's a pub of some note with a history dating back to the 11th century when it began life as a monk\u2019s ale and cider house. The pilgrims who passed on their way to Canterbury would refresh themselves and perhaps stay the night. It is also said that James II stayed here whilst escaping the country to France. They serve high quality dishes and have a lovely garden area to sit out in on warmer days. You can find them on Upper Street at postcode ME17 1UW. Just to the north of here there's also the lovely Hucking Estate which includes a Norman church, a waymarked sculpture trail and another fine country pub at the north western end. The historic village is also worth exploring with over a hundred listed buildings including some fine timber framed structures on Eyhorne Street and the noteworthy All Saints Church which dates from the 14th century. The Kent Downs village of Lenham is a good choice for a pit stop. The worthy settlement includes a pretty square and a historic high street with a number of listed buildings. There's also a Grade I listed Tithe Barn, a notable 14th century church and an early 1600s pub to investigate. The Dog and Bull was originally built in 1602 and visited by Queen Anne in 1704 - her coat of arms is still displayed above the door today. They serve fine food and have a pleasant courtyard garden for the summer months. You can find them on the Square at postcode ME17 2PG for your sat navs."
