The Saddle Knob is the grassy slope, with an old quarry at its foot. In the background is the much bigger Betchworth Quarry - until a few years ago its white cliff was a landmark for miles around. Now only the top shows, the rest having been used as a large landfill, now landscaped and being managed to make new downland. In the very far distance is White Downs. Box Hill, perhaps the most famous part of this stretch of the North Downs, is not visible, lying around the corner beyond Betchworth Quarry."
