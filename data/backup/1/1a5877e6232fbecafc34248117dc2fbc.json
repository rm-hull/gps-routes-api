  "description": "This West Sussex based village, lies just to the west of East Grinstead on the edge of the High Weald AONB. This circular walk uses sections of the Worth Way and the Sussex Border Path to explore the countryside and woodland to the east of the settlement. On the way there's some nice countryside views and a visit to the pond in the Worth Way country park. To continue your walking around Crawley Down you could head south east to visit Weir Wood Reservoir. The large lake includes a fine waterside trail and is considered one of the area highlights.",
