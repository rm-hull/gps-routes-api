To comply with current safety legislations, it has been necessary to drain and formally \u0091discontinue' the structure to ensure that it can no longer retain significant volumes of water."

  "description": "This walk visits Barbrook Reservoir and Stone Circle on Big Moor and Ramsley Moor in the Peak District National Park. There's much to enjoy with waterside trails, a series of ancient sites and wonderful views across the moors. You can start the walk from the roadside parking area on the B6054 just west of Holmesfield. Then follow trails south along the Bar Brook to the reservoir which dates to the 19th century. You continue south to a smaller reservoir before heading south east to visit the stones. The stone circle is part of a cairn field on the moor with 80 cairns from the prehistoric and Bronze Age era. The area is a designated Scheduled Ancient Monument. It's a tranquil and somewhat desolate place with rolling hills of heather and gorse adding to the atmospheric scene. To continue your walking in this area head west to the fine viewpoints at White Edge, Froggatt Edge and Curbar Edge .",
