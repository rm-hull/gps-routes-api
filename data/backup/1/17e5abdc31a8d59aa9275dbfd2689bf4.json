  "description": "This circular walk explores the expansive sand dune system of a beautiful nature reserve on the North Devon Coast. On the way you can enjoy a variety of wildlife, coastal views and several species of specialised plants. Braunton Burrows covers nearly 900 hectares making it the second largest\u00a0dune system in England. Almost 500 species of plant have been recorded making Braunton the most biodiverse parish in England. Plant species include sea stock, sand toadflax, bee orchid and water germander. It's also great for wildlife with hundreds of rabbits, 33 species of butterfly and birds which include the Ringed Plover. You can easily extend your walk by heading to the coast and enjoying a stroll along the lovely Saunton Sands on the Croyde Bay and Saunton Sands Walk . The Tarka Trail also passes the reserve so you could pick this up and head to the estuary of the Rivers Taw and Torridge which is a short distance away. This circular walk starts from the car park at the end of Sandy Lane but you could also start from Braunton village and follow the Tarka Trail to the reserve.",
