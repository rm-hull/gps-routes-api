This particular stone is the best place from which to view the other stones, which are to the left, right and behind the photographer. It proved impossible to get all stones in shot. The stone circle appears to be elliptical, approximately 16m wide at the narrowest point. From this location, looking back it appears that a low henge could form part of this structure."

  "description": "This circular walk visits Owler Tor on the Longshaw Estate in the Peak District. The tor is popular for rock climbers and well known for its giant boulders and fine views. You can start the walk from the Surprise view car park off the A1687 near Hathersage. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south east to Owler Tor which stands at a height of 302m. The walk then descends to the Burbage Brook in the stunning Padley Gorge . Follow the waterside path south west before turning north to visit the Lawrence Field Stone Circle. From here it is a short walk north back to the car park. To continue your walking in the area you could try the Millstone Edge Walk which starts from the same car park. There's more wonderful geology and fine views on this circular trail which additionally visits Over Owler Tor.",
