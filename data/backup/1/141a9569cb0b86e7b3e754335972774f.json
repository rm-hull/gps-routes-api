  "description": "Visit this lovely area of the Dorset coast on this circular walk to Dancing Ledge. The walk starts at the car park in the pretty village of Langton Matravers and descends to the coast through some attractive countryside. Dancing Ledge is so called because when the waves wash over the surface of the rocks it appears as the the ledge is 'dancing'. It's a very pretty spot with lovely views down the coast and the option of continuing to Seacombe Cliff and the nearby village of Worth Matravers. To extend your walk you could pick up the South West Coast Path and head east towards Swanage and Durlston Country Park. Our Purbeck Circular Walk also passes the site so you could pick this up and explore the beautiful Isle of Purbeck.",
