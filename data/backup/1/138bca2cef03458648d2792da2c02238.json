  "description": "Enjoy a short waterside walk or cycle around this pretty park in Cheltenham . In the park you will find aviaries\u00a0, small areas of woodland and three lakes with waterside paths. You will also pass the impressive\u00a0Grade I\u00a0listed Pittville Pump Room. Built in 1825 it is the last and largest of the\u00a0spa\u00a0buildings to be built in\u00a0Cheltenham. There are also play areas for children, a boat house and cafe. Cyclists can cycle around the two western lakes so it's a nice option for anyone looking for a safe family ride in the town.",
