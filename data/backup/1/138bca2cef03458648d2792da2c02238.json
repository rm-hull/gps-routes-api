  "description": "Enjoy a short waterside walk or cycle around this pretty park in Cheltenham. In the park you will find aviaries , small areas of woodland and three lakes with waterside paths. You will also pass the impressive Grade I listed Pittville Pump Room. Built in 1825 it is the last and largest of the spa buildings to be built in Cheltenham. There are also play areas for children, a boat house and cafe. Cyclists can cycle around the two western lakes so it's a nice option for anyone looking for a safe family ride in the town.",
