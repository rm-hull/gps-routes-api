  "description": "This is a popular circular walk from St Ives to Zennor along the South West Coast Path. It's about a 6 mile walk along the coast path with the option of returning through the countryside. It then becomes a lovely 12 mile circular walk. Most of the path is pretty good but there is some climbing and scrambling required on some sections of the path. There's wonderful coastal scenery with dramatic cliffs rising hundreds of feet above the sea, beautiful beaches and delightful coves. You start at St Ives head and then head west passing Porthmeor beach and the Tate Gallery. You then head to Zennor Head passing Hor Point, Pen Enys Point, Carn Naun Point and Gala Rocks. There are also views over to the Carracks, home to a colony of Grey Atlantic Seals. Boat trips to the island are available from St Ives. When you reach Zennor head you turn away from the coast towards the little village. Here you will find the Church of Saint Senara which dates from the Norman period and the 13th and 15th centuries. The return leg takes you from Zennor back to St Ives via some beautiful countryside. You'll pass Tremedda and Trevalgan before passing through the outskirts of the town and returning to St Ives Head. To extend your walk you can follow the coast path to the lovely Carbis Bay .",
