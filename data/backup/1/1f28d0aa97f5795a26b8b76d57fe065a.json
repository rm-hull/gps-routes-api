  "description": "Enjoy some spectacular coastal views on this circular walk along Flamborough Head in the North York Moors. On the walk you'll pass towering white chalk cliffs, coves, caves, pretty bays and the oldest surviving lighthouse in Britain. The area is also designated as a nature reserve so look out for large seabird colonies including auks, gannets and gulls. In summer you may also see fulmars, herring gulls, kittiwakes, guillemots, razorbills and puffins. In the Holmes area there are also interesting plants and flowers which attract a variety of butterflies. This walk starts at the village of Flamborough and picks up a footpath south to the coast. You then head along the coast passing Cross Bow Hill and a radio station beacon. You continue past Selwicks Bay to Thornwick Bay before returning to Flamborough via another countryside footpath. The headland is located near to the popular town of Bridlington so you could walk along the coast to the site. See the Bridlington to Flamborough Head Coastal Walk for more details. The East Riding Heritage Way also passes through Flamborough Head so you could continue along this path to the nearby Bempton Cliffs where you can see more seabirds. Also nearby is the pretty Dane's Dyke. These pretty woods have peaceful trails with lots of flora and fauna to look out for.",

You could also head west from the headland to Thornwick Bay and enjoy wonderful views from the cliff top cafe. The cafe's speciality is locally caught crab which you can enjoy with a glass of wine or cup of tea. It's a great place to relax with some refreshments and enjoy the views at the same time."
