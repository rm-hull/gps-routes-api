  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Swiss Valley Reservoirs in Llanelli.  Also known as the Upper Lliedi reservoir and Lower Lliedi reservoir, the area is a fine place for a waterside stroll. The two reservoirs are located just north of the town with a free car park at the northern end of the lower reservoir. From here you can pick up a circular walking trail running around the lake for about 1.7 miles. The trail is tarmacked on one side so suitable for most abilities. On the other side it is a bit rougher so good shoes are required. Just to the west of the site you can pick up the Swiss Valley Cycle Route which runs along a disused railway line. The long distance St Illtyd's Walk also runs past the reservoir. You could pick up this waymarked footpath and follow it south towards Llanelli.",
