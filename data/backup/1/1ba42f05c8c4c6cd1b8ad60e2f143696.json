Now owned by the National Trust the lighthouse was opened in 1871 and was the first to use alternating current which gave much better reliability than direct current. The dark window on the left was an innovation designed to provide a fixed two colour light across Sunderland Bay. Ships would steer along the white sector before turning into the port of Sunderland; if the light turned red they had drifted too close to the rocks."

  "description": "This coastal town in Tyne and Wear sits in a fine spot at the mouth of the River Tyne. This walk takes you along the coast in the town, visiting some of the area's highlights including South Shields Lighthouse, the South Pier, Ocean Beach pleasure Park, Trow Point, Souter Lighthouse and Whitburn Coastal Park. It's a geologically interesting stretch of coast with rocky coves, sea stacks, caves and natural arches to admire. The walk starts at the Littlehaven Beach Car Park at the northern end of the promenade in the town. From here it is a short walk up to the South Shields Lighthouse at the tip of the River Tyne entrance. You then head south east where you can enjoy a stroll out onto South Shields pier where there's nice views back to the town and out to sea. You then continue along Herd Sand Beach to Trow Point, Frenchman's Bay, Marsden Cliff Nature Reserve, the Souter Lighthouse and Whitburn Coastal Park.  The park is a nature reserve with trees, a bird observatory, viewing screens and wetland habitats. There's also a new National Trust wildlife garden with ponds, wildflowers, trees, berry bearing shrubs, a bog garden and hibernation areas. It's a wonderful area for wildlife watching with cormorants, shags, kittiwakes, fulmar and herring gulls. After exploring the coastal park the route retraces it's steps with some alternative paths to follow through the Marsden Lea area.",
