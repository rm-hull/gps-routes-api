  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Coleton Fishacre gardens before picking up the South West Coast Path for a stretch along the coast. There's 24 acres of stunning coastal gardens to explore on a series of well laid out stone footpaths. It is full of rare and exotic plants due to the mild climate in this area of Devon. There are terraces with sculptures and pretty pools, herbaceous borders, streams and woodland. The gardens run from the 1920s Art Deco house to the coast. There is a gate at the end of the garden which allows you to pick up the South West Coast Path . You can head along the coast to Inner Froward Point before picking up a footpath through the countryside to return you to the gardens. Coleton Fishacre is located close to Dartmouth . You can catch the ferry to Kingswear and follow footpaths from there to the gardens.",
