  "description": "This large Hampshire based town sits between Southampton and Winchester in the Borough of Eastleigh. It's a good place to start a walk with a train station, riverside trails and some fine local parks to explore. This circular walk takes you along the Itchen Way before visiting the nearby Lakeside Country Park. The route starts at the train station and heads east to pick up the riverside trail. Follow the waymarked footpath south and it will take you past Southampton Airport and Itchen Valley Country Park which lies just to the east. The park is well worth a small detour with lots of water loving wildlife to look out for. At Swaythling you cross the river and follow trails north to Lakeside Country Park. The 60 acre park includes lakes, wet meadow and woodland with some pleasant trails to try. There's also a decent cafe where you could stop off for some refreshments. Head north through the park and you can follow minor roads through the town to return to the train station. This final section will take you past the Eastleigh Museum where you can learn all about the history of the area. Near here there's also the town park with a Victorian bandstand and pretty flowerbeds. See below for a list of other walks in and around Eastleigh.",
