  "description": "Climb to this viewpoint in Croydon and enjoy great views across the City of London and the North Downs. You can park at the Addington Hills car park in Upper Shirley and pick up the footpaths from there. It's a short climb to the viewpoint where you can enjoy far reaching views towards Parliament Hill and Docklands. There's 130 acres to explore in the park with woodland and London's largest area of heathland\u00a0to enjoy. It's great for flora and fauna with bell heather, gorse, marsh violet, common lizards and green woodpeckers to look out for. The London Loop passes through the park so you can pick this up to continue your walking. If you head east you'll come to the Addington Golf Course, Threehalfpenny Wood, Coney Hall and Keston Common and Hayes Common . Heading south will take you to Littleheath Woods and Selsdon Wood where there is a nature reserve with lots of wildlife, ponds, open meadows and miles of waymarked walking trails. Just to the west is Croham Hurst Woods where you'll find ancient woodland and a climb to Breackneck Hill. Croydon is also just a short walk along the Vanguard Way . To visit the park by tram you can get off at the Coombe Road tram stop.",
