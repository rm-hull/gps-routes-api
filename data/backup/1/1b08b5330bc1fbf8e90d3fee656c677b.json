  "description": "Enjoy 7 lakes, 2 rivers, 3 bird hides and several meadows in this terrific 335 acre park in Hurst. There are excellent facilities with a Rangers Office, cafe, picnic area and the Dinton Activity Centre where kayaking, canoeing, sailing, powerboating and climbing activities are available. The Museum of Berkshire Aviation and the headquarters of the British Entomological and Natural History Society are also located in the park. It's a great place for birdwatching with a number of species to see on the water. There are three bird hides where you can enjoy the scene. A few miles to the south there's California Country Park where there are more good lakeside walking trails and wildlife watching opportunities. The National Trust's Finchampstead Ridges can also be visited in this area.",
