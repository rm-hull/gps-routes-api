  "description": "Explore the estate, gardens and coastline surrounding this Elizabethan manor house on the Isle of Wight. The first part of the walk takes you around the beautiful gardens which include a young olive grove, a small organic kitchen garden and a traditional tea garden. It's the perfect place for a peaceful stroll with colourful herbaceous borders, a rose garden, bluebell woods, wildflower banks and views towards the sea. The route then heads into the wider estate visiting the interesting Neolithic Long Stone. The stone is believed to have marked the entrance to a long barrow or burial chamber. You then head to Castle Hill before following the Worsley Trail along Mottistone Down where you will pass a series of Bronze Age burial mounds. The gorse habitat on the downs attracts a variety of wildlife - look out for butterflies like the Marbled White and birds such as Dartford warbler, yellowhammer, linnet and kestrel. The trail then heads through Mottistone Common on peaceful woodland trails before returning to the Manor. The next section of the walk takes you down to the coast through the lovely countryside in Mottistone. You'll reach Sudmoor Point and then enjoy a walk along a cliff-top path before following Ridge Lane back to the Manor.",
