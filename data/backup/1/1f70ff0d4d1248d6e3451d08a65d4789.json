  "description": "Starting at Mow Cop, follow the Newcastle Way through Staffordshire to Market Drayton. You will pass through rough Moorland scenery around Mow Cop, rich farming country near Madeley before heading along the sandstone ridges of Maer and Ashley and then across the wide open spaces of Blore Heath to Almington. There are some challenging climbs with views to the west of the Shropshire Hills and south as far as Cannock Chase. Highlights on the way include visits to Silverdale Country Park and Apedale Country Park near the attractive market town of Newcastle Under Lyme .",
