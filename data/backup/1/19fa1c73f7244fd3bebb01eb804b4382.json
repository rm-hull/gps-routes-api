Located on the north bank of the River Boyne, directly opposite Trim Castle, the abbey was established on land attributed to St. Patrick, who is often believed to have founded it. This abbey was a significant pilgrimage destination, renowned for the curative powers of its statue of the Virgin Mary, until it was dissolved under Henry VIII during the Reformation. Today, little of the abbey survives, apart from the Yellow Steeple \u2013 the remains of the abbey bell tower, named for the yellow hue the stonework casts in the setting sun \u2013 and Talbot's Castle, a former abbey structure converted into a manor house."
