  "description": "This park in Northolt has some good cycling and walking trails to try. The main features of the park are the four artificial hills made out of the rubble from the old Wembley Stadium. You can climb the distinctive hills for great views over London and Canary Wharf. There's also a number of water features with fishing lakes, streams, wetlands and wildlife ponds. Other habitats include woodland, scrub, wildflower meadows and marshy grassland. The park has good facilities with a car park just off the A40 and another off Kensington Road. You can see the mounds and the car park on the google street view link below. If you are coming by public transport then Northolt\u00a0tube is a short walk away. For cyclists London Cycle Route 88 and National Cycle Route 6 run close to the site. The park includes a visitor centre with a cafe and toilets. It is also home to a popular weekly park run. Just to the north of the site is Belvue Park and the Northolt Manor nature reserve where you will find meadows, scrub, woodlands, wetlands and ponds. Rectory Park lies just to the south. The Grand Union Canal runs just to the east of the park so you could pick this up to continue your exercise. If you follow it east you will soon come to Horsenden Hill where you will find meadows, wetland and woodland\u00a0with splendid views over the city. Also nearby is the Hillingdon Trail which you can follow along the Yeading Brook to the Yeadling Brook Nature Reserve and ten acre wood.",
