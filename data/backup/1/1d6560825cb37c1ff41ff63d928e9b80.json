Salle Hall was built in 1761 for Edward Hase; alterations were made in 1862, and east and west service blocks were added in 1910 for Sir Woolmer White. The east wing contains an Orangery. (N.

  "description": "This small market town in Norfolk lies in a pleasant spot between the River\u00a0Bure\u00a0and River Wensum valleys. There's immediate access to miles of countryside trails, two interesting local old halls and a small pocket of ancient woodland to the south east of the town. This circular walk from the town takes you along a section of the Marriot's Way to the neighbouring village of Cawston before returning via Booton Common and Booton Hall. On the way there's nice country views across Reepham Moor and an interesting 17th century manor house to see. The walk starts at the northern end of the village where you can pick up the old dismantled railway line on the Marriot's Way. Follow the shared cycling and walking trail north east and it will take you to Cawston. The route then picks up other public footpaths to take you south east along Green Lane to Booton Common and Booton Hall. The hall dates from the early 17th century and is notable as the ancestral home of John Rolfe, one of the early English settlers of North America. He is credited with the first successful cultivation of\u00a0tobacco\u00a0as an export crop in the\u00a0Colony of Virginia. He is also known as the man who married the Native American princess Pocahontas. The adjacent common lies in the valley of a tributary of the River Wensum. It consists of ancient woodland nd and wet heathland with several rare plants including the Fragrant Orchid. Shortly after passing the hall and the common you return to Reepham.",
