A quiet part of the coast near Newport showing [left] the now rather feeble remains of the wooden \"rank\" used to hold the distinctive conical putcher baskets which were set out against the ebb tide to catch salmon. A second rank once stood to the south west of the cliff. It is thought that this method of salmon fishing originated with the Romans and was continued by the monks at the 12th century Priory, sited on the cliff top until at least 1424. After the Dissolution the valuable fishing rights passed to Eton College as did most of the parish lands. The fisheries have now been closed for some years. (historical detail)"

  "description": "This little Welsh village is located just south east of the city of Newport. There's some nice coastal trails along the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel to enjoy here. The village also includes a notable medieval church which is Grade I listed. This circular walk starts in the village and follows a section of the Wales coast path west along the sea wall and Portland Grounds to Goldcliff. Here you'll find the remains of a Benedictine Priory and pretty lagoons arond Golfcliff Pill. The coastal area is great for wildlife with lots of waders to look out for on the water. The walk then heads east, following a mixture of country lanes and footpaths back to Redwick, passing Whitson on the way.",

The start point is the Farmers Arms pub in Goldcliff which is well worth a visit. If you continue west you could visit the Newport Wetlands. Here you'll find a large nature reserve with footpaths taking you around the Gwent Levels . The Newport Canal Walk can also be picked up near the city. Head east along the coast and you could visit the historic Caldicot Castle."
