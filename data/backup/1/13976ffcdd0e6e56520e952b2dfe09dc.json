When her brother Ferdinand began the construction of Waddesdon Manor in 1874, Miss Rothschild acquired a nearby property at Eythrope where, between 1876 and 1879, she had a park and garden created and Eythrope Pavilion built, near to the River Thame. Because she had suffered from rheumatic fever, she had been advised not to sleep near water because dampness would aggravate her health, so the Pavilion was originally built for daytime occupation only and at nights she returned to Waddesdon Manor. The house was later extended and today looks something of a pot pourri of styles."

  "description": "This walk visits Eythrope Park from the Oxfordshire village of Waddesdon. The privately owned estate is generally not open to the public but their are public footpaths to follow around its borders. You can start the walk from the car park in Waddesdon village and then follow the North Bucks Way south for about 2 miles to reach the park. Here you'll find some pleasant paths around the fringes of the estate with views towards the lake and pavillion. On its southern borders you can also enjoy riverside walks along the Thame. You can explore this further on the Thame Valley Walk which can be picked up in this area. On certain days through the summer there are guided tours of the 4 acre garden within the park. The garden supplies vegetables, fruit, herbs and cut flowers for the Rothschild family as well as Waddesdon\u2019s restaurants, hotel and artisan food market of nearby Waddesdon Manor. See the link below for more information.",
