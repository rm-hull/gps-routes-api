  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around this pretty nature reserve near Bury St Edmunds . The site includes heathland, riverside meadows, woodland, wet woodland scrub and small areas of fen. There's lots of wildlife to look out for including a good population of Britain's only poisonous snake, the adder. You can park at Temple Bridge to start your walk which follows part of the Icknield Way Path . Near to the reserve you can also pick up the Lark Valley Path and enjoy a riverside stroll along the River Lark. You could follow it west into the attractive market town of Mildenhall . Also nearby is King's Forest and the popular West Stow Country Park . On the southern side of the park there's also Lackford Lakes where there's a free car park, cafe and visitor centre. Birds visiting the lakes include kingfisher, great crested grebe and tufted duck.",
