For a long time in the 20th century buses and cars vied for space around the structure. In 1999 Fenland District Council enhanced the area making it more pedestrian friendly."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you to a series of historical sites in the Cambridgshire town of Whittlesey. The ancient market town is a fascinating place for a walk with some splendid architecture, listed buildings, scheduled ancient monuments and old churches. At the southern end of the walk there's nice views of the Briggate River. The route links up with other trails that will take you to the nearby Lattersey Nature Reserve and King\u2019s Dyke Nature Reserve. You can start and finish the walk at the historic market place where there is an information board with more details. To continue your walking in the town head north to pick up the Nene Way and enjoy a waterside walk along the River Nene.\nThe long distance Hereward Way also passes through the town.\nhttps://www.fenland.gov.uk/media/19097/Whittlesey-Heritage-Walk-Brochure/pdf/WHW_Brochure_2.pdf?m=638053163792800000\nhttps://www.fenland.gov.uk/WhittleseyHeritageWalk",
