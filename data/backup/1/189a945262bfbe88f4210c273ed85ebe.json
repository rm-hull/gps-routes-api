  "description": "This lovely waterside walk takes you along the River Nore and canal in the city of Kilkenny. The route runs for about 4.5km along a fairly flat path taking you into the countryside east of the city. You can start the walk from Canal Square where there is a car park. From here pick up the trail and head east, passing the historic Kilkenny Castle. The castle dates back to the late 12th century and includes extensive parkland. You could take a detour from the route to explore the footpaths around the grounds and beautiful gardens. Shortly after passing the castle you will pick up the Canal Walk and follow it south east, passing the duck pond and the 'Hug For You' monument created during the Covid-19 pandemic. You continue past the Ossory Bridge before finishing at Warrington Lane near the old Warrington Distillery. To continue your waterside walking in the area you could pick up the Nore Valley Walk which runs on the opposite side of the water. This waymarked trail will take you along the river to the village of Bennettsbridge.",

      "content": "Just to the east of the city you can pick up the Barrow Way, a 100km walk following the River Barrow from Robertstown, County Kildare to St Mullins Walk in County Carlow. The Graiguenamanagh to St Mullins Walk is a popular section along the trail which starts a few miles south east of Kilkenny. The Brandon Hill Loop also starts in Graiguenamanagh. The circular waymarked trail climbs to the summit of the the highest mountain in County Kilkenny. There are great views over the countryside to the coast from this fine vantage point. Near here there's also the popular climb to Mount Leinster. The 796-metre-high mountain is one of the walking highlights of the area with great views over Wexford, Carlow, Kildare and Waterford."
