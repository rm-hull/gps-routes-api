  "description": "Enjoy a series of walking trails in this delightful nature reserve near Whitchurch. The site is 77 acres and includes marshes, pools, heathland and woodland. It's great for bird watching with woodpeckers, jays, Canada goose, mallard and great crested grebe regular visitors. Look out for froglets, dragonflies and great crested newts around the wetland areas.",

      "content": "Just to the north there's Comber Mere. The 12th century abbey includes a large lake and bluebell woodland which is open to the public on certain open days. Near here you'll also find the worthy village of Wrenbury. The settlement is a conservation area with a number of historic properties including an early 16th century church overlooking the pretty village green. There's also a fine canalside pub with a lovely garden to visit. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Walks page."
