In the spring there are carpets of bluebells and bright yellow celandines to enjoy. You can also stroll along the Rivacre Brook and look out for a variety of wildlife and wooden sculptures. There is parking on site and Overpool rail station is not far too. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Wirral Way and head to the nearby Wirral Country Park .",

Inside there's a charming interior with old photos of the area. Outside there's a nice garden area to relax in on warmer days. You can find them at postcode CH66 1QN for your sat navs."

      "content": "Head a couple of miles east of the park and you can pick up the Ellesmere Port Walk. The walk explores the National Waterways Museum at the town's docks before heading along the canal. The fascinating museum is concerned with the history of the UK's rivers and canals, with exhibits including canal boats, traditional clothing and steam engines. It's a nice place for a stroll with a number of surfaced footpaths to follow around the site. You can also pick up the Shropshire Union Canal here and follow the towpath south in the countryside. To the south of the town there's the ancient woodland to explore in Stanney Woods. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
