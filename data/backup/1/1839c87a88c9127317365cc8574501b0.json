The fascinating museum is concerned with the history of the UK's rivers and canals, with exhibits including canal boats, traditional clothing and steam engines. It's a nice place for a stroll with a number of surfaced footpaths to follow around the site. You can also pick up the Shropshire Union Canal here and follow the towpath south in the countryside. On the western outskirts of the town there's  Rivacre Valley Country Park. It's a pretty place which is popular for its springtime bluebells and wildflower meadows. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
