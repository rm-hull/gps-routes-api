  "description": "Enjoy a visit to Pressmennan Wood and Pressmennan Lake on this circular walk near Dunbar in East Lothian. There's over 200 acres to explore with views of the Firth of Forth and Bass Rock. You can also enjoy a stroll along Pressmennan Lake, one of only three lakes in Scotland. It's a splendid place with Pressmennan considered by many to be one of the best woods in the UK. There's a nice waymarked walking trail starting from the car park at the western end of the woods. Along the way there's lots of interesting flora to look out for including bluebells, conifers, wild garlic (ransoms) and wild raspberries. Wildlife is abundant with deer, hares, bats, otters and owls. It's great for children too with a sculpture trail where they can hunt for fairies known as Glingbobs and Tooflits. To continue your walking in the area try the Dunbar Cliff Walk which gives fine views of the ruined Dunbar Castle and Bass Rock.",
