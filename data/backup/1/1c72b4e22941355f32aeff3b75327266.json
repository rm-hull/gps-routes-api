  "description": "Explore this limestone headland in Llandudno and enjoy spectacular views of the North Wales coast on this circular walk. Waymarked trails take you around the park where there are views of Liverpool Bay and the Irish Sea, the Carneddau mountains, the Menai Strait and Anglesey. You can also climb to the summit of the park or catch the Great Orme Victorian Tramway and Cable Car to get there. The area is geologically significant with limestone and dolomite rock formations dating from between 339 and 326 million years old. It's also great for flora and fauna with lots of lovely wildlfowers such as pyramidal orchid, common rockrose and wild thyme carpeting the grassland. Also look out for the Kashmiri goats grazing on the slopes of the headland.  The 200 strong herd, has roamed the Orme since the middle of the 19th century. They're descended from a pair of goats that were presented by the Shah of Persia to Queen Victoria shortly after her coronation in 1837. The North Wales Path long distance trail runs around the park. You can extend your walk by picking up the trail and heading south east toward Llandudno and Little Orme. Great Orme's little brother is not as well known but is a another splendid coastal headland with fabulous views over Penrhyn Bay. It's also a great place for wildlife with bredding fulmars and seals in Angel Bay. Heading south along the coast path takes you past the lovely Conwy Sands to Conwy.",
