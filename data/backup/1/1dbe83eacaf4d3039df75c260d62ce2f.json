  "description": "St Just in Penwith is notable as the most westerly town in mainland Britain. It's a great place for walking with beautiful coastline and a series of interesting old mines to explore. This coastal walk from the town takes you to the lovely Cape Cornwall and then on to Land's End at the western tip of the country. It's about a 7 mile walk running along a section of the epic South West Coast Path. The walk starts in the village and follows country lanes west to Cape Cornwall. Here you can enjoy some glorious views to the Isles of Scilly and Land's End. The walk then heads south along the undulating cliff top path to Porth Nanven in the wildlife rich Cot Valley before coming to the lovely Sennen Cove . You continue to Land's End, passing the beautiful beaches at Whitesand Bay on the way. Here you can pick up the Land's End Trail which runs for over 300 miles to Avebury in Wiltshire.",
