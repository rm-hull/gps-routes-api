  "description": "This beautiful reservoir near the Derbyshire village of Brackenfield is one of Derbyshire's premier bird watching sites. There's a car park at the western end of the reservoir where you can view the birds from a bird hide. Look out for Shelduck, Mandarin, Teal, Gadwall and Common Scoters. You may also see Osprey and Buzzard. There's also public footpaths climbing west into the countryside where you can enjoy views over the reservoir. You can extend your walk by following the footpath south to Brackenfield. It is also possible to turn it into a long circular walk using a combination of footpaths and country lanes. If you enjoy this walk then you could head to the nearby Carsington Water where there is a circular cycling and walking trail to follow around the reservoir. There's also more great bird watching opportunities here. A few miles to the east you can pick up the long distance Five Pits Trail at Tibshelf. The reservoir is located close to the village of Ashover. You could reach the site from there by following footpaths along the River Amber to Milltown. The county town of Matlock is also nearby where you can pick up several good walking trails.",

They have a charming interior with a real fire and a lovely garden outside for warmer weather. You can find them in the hamlet of Woolley Moor at postcode DE55 6FG for your sat navs. It's about a 10 minute walk from the northern end of the lake."

Near here there's also the Midland Railway Centre. Here you'll find a 35 acre country park with a heritage railway and more nice waterside trails around Butterley Reservoir and Codnor Park Reservoir. To the north there's the village of Wingerworth where there are some nice waterside trails along the Wingerworth Lido and the Great Pond of Stubbing.
