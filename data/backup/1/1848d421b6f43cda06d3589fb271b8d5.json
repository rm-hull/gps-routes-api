This is what you will find at the New Forest Reptile Centre, which has had various names in the past (including the Holidays Hill Reptillary). The pits have various indigenous snakes and lizards and on a warm day they can be seen basking in their \"natural\" environment. The Forestry Commission website says that \"The Centre actively encourages the conservation and re-introduction of these animals across the country.\""

  "description": "Follow the Reptile Discovery Trail on this easy walk in the New Forest. The trail takes place on well surfaced tree lined paths with a variety of wildlife to look out for. The centre has all of Britain's native lizards, snakes, frogs and toads. You can also view birds of prey on the nest cams and look out for dragonflies and tadpoles in the pond. It's a great educational walk for families or anyone looking for an easy, informative stroll. If you'd like to extend your walk you could pick up our Lyndhurst Circular Walk and visit the Knightwood Oak which is less than a mile from the trail.",
