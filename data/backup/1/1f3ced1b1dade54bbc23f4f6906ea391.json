Sherburn's links with the air industry go back to the Second World War when the Blackburn Aircraft Company built the Fairey Swordfish in the village. Production ended in 1945, and by then 1,699 such aircraft had been built in Sherburn. The airfield also saw the first flight of L.E. Baynes's famous prototype glider, the Baynes Bat."

The field adjoining All Saints' Church is the site of the palace of kings of Elmet, which was given (with the manor of Cawood) by Athelstan to the Archbishops of York on his conversion to Christianity in or around the 10th century. The church itself is unusually large for a village parish church and dates from around 1120, with Norman pillars and a later-built large tower housing a ring of eight bells. It was built on the site of an earlier Anglo-Saxon church. The church is now a Grade I listed building"

  "description": "This historic village in North Yorkshire is located just west of Selby. The settlement is noted for its 12th century church and large airfield just to the east. This walk from the village takes you to Bishop Wood near Selby. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths east past the train station and the Sherburn-in-Elmet Airfield, which is currently the base for the Sherburn Aero Club. You'll pass Lenerton Farm, the Carr Dike and Rest Park before coming to Bishop Wood. These expansive woods have a number of flat trails with bluebells in the spring months and wildflowers in the summer.",
