The Duke of Northumberland's River is an early artificial waterway taking water from the Colne to the Crane and to Syon Park. A British History Online article on East Bedfont from the Victoria County History of Middlesex says it is \"said to have been made by the convent of Syon in the time of Henry V.\" The water has been used for Twickenham and Isleworth mills and there were disputes between the mill owners who wanted the water for power, and the Dukes of Northumberland who wanted it for lakes in Syon Park. The river ran across the site of Heathrow Airport, was put into pipes underneath in the 1940s, but has recently been diverted around the south of the airport"

The river runs from Longford, now at the north east corner of Heathrow Airport. Until recently it ran under the airport, but with the building of the 5th terminal it has been diverted around the south of the airport. The river remained crown property, and some bridges over it have the royal cypher."
