  "description": "This walk visits a beautiful secluded bay and the wonderful sea stacks at Ladram Bay on the Jurassic Coast . It's a short walk of just under 3 miles from the town of Sidmouth, but there is a fair climb to Peak Hill and High Peak which stands at a height of 157 metres (515\u00a0ft). From the high points there are stunning views down the coast in both directions. The route starts on the seafront in Sidmouth and follows the coast path west past the lovely Sidmouth Beach. You then climb to the photogenic High Peak with its partially eroded cliff face, with four rock\u00a0strata. The area is geologically significant with the base of the cliffs dating from the Triassic Period about 220 Million years ago. The deposits in the centre of the cliff face are from the\u00a0Mercia Mudstone Group\u00a0and were formed about 200 Million years ago. The trail passes through a small woodland area at High Peak before descending to Ladram Bay. Here you will find the striking\u00a0sandstone sea stacks in a lovely bay with a small beach. The 'Otter Sandstone' that forms the cliffs and sea stacks were deposited in hot dry climates in the\u00a0Triassic Period\u00a0about 220 Million years ago. Just a mile to the west of the bay you will find the pretty village of Otterton where you can visit Otterton Mill . It's an attractive little village with a green, thatched cottages and a pretty stream running through it. The historic mill is set in a lovely location by the river and is open to visitors for free. In nearby Budleigh Salterton you can visit the River Otter and the Otter Estuary which is a great place for bird watching. Our longer Exmouth to Sidmouth Walk and the Sidmouth to Budleigh Salterton Walk visit the site and gives great views of the Exe Estuary also.",
