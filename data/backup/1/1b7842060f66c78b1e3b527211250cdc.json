  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Ceredigion Coast Path and the Wales coast path from the little village of Llanrhystud to the town of Aberaeron. The route runs for a distance of about 8 miles, following a fairly flat path with a moderate climb on the way. You will also pass the villages of Llansantffraid, Llanon and Aberarth and the remnants of a medieval field strip section known as Morfa Esgob. At the end of the route you can pick up the popular Aberaeron to Llanerchaeron Walk which will take you to a lovely National Trust owned Georgian villa.",
