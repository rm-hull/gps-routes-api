  "description": "This delightful little Sussex village has a number of pretty cottages with well kept gardens, a smock windmill, 17th century stocks, winding lanes and an ancient 12th century church to admire. This circular walk from the village visits neighbouring Thakeham and explores the farmland surrounding the village. The walk starts in the village centre and heads east towards Oakwood Farm before following a country bridle track south east to Thakeham. You can then follow footpaths west to Southlands Farm and Meer's Farm before turning north and then east to return to West Chiltington.",
