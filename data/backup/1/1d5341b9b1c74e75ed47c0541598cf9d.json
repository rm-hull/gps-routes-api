  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk around this lovely reservoir on Dartmoor. The reservoir is surrounded by steep sided banks covered with trees and gorse bushes. There is also a spectacular dam with wonderful views over the West Okement valley. Parking is available at the eastern end of the reservoir but you could walk or cycle to the dam from nearby Okehampton using the Granite Way or the Dartmoor Way. It's a lovely two mile walk from the centre of Okehampton. Just to the north of the reservoir you will find the impressive Meldon Viaduct. The 19th century structure is a short walk from the car park at the northern end of the water. The walk to the highest point in Dartmoor at High Willhays also starts from the reservoir car park.",
