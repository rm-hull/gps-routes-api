  "description": "This Cumbrian island is located on Morecambe Bay in Barrow in Furness. It's a fine place for walking and wildlife watching with an abundance of sea birds to look for from the island's two nature reserves. This walk takes you from South to North Walney using a section of the Cistercian Way which runs across the island. The walk starts at the South Walney Nature Reserve car park. The reserve is a splendid place for wildlife with lots of coastal birds and the only grey seal colony in Cumbria to see. It also includes several waymarked colour coded walking trails where you can look out for species including eider duck, great black-backed gull, oystercatcher, ringed plover, shelduck, curlew, redshank, redstart and pink-footed geese. From the car park at the reserve you can pick up footpaths heading north to link with the Cistercian Way around Snab Point. This will take you north along country lanes to Biggar and Vickerstown. Here you pick up a coastal path along the western side of the island which will take you into the North Walney Nature Reserve. There's more nice trails here with sand dunes and a series of ponds where you can look out for natterjack toads. From Walney there are fine views over to Piel Island to the east. The island includes a ruined 14th century castle and a historic pub dating back hundreds of years. You can catch a ferry to the island from nearby Roa Island.",

Just to the north of Barrow there's also Dalton-in-Furness where you can visit Dalton Castle. The 14th century Pele Tower has strong connections to Furness Abbey and is run by the National Trust.
