  "description": "This large area of common land in Surrey consists of heathland, ponds and birch, oak and pine woodland. It's run by the National Trust and is covered with lots of good footpaths to follow. The area is full of flora and fauna with purple heathers, interesting fungi and birds such as Tree pipits, Nightingales and Woodlarks. There's lots of good options to continue your walking in the area. If you head west you will soon come to Thursley National Nature Reserve and Frensham Ponds Country Park . You can visit the ponds and the expansive Hankley Common on the Tilford Walk or the circular Elstead Walk .",
