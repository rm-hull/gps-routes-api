  "description": "This is a popular coastal walk between these two East Sussex towns. It passes through many of the highlights of this beautiful area of the South Downs. This includes visits to Cuckmere River and Cuckmere Haven, Birling Gap, Seven Sisters Country Park, Friston Forest and Beachy Head. The route uses sections of the long distance Vanguard Way and South Downs Way to guide you along the coast. As such the footpaths are waymarked and generally in good condition. It's about a 13 mile walk with the option of returning to Seaford on a splendid coastal bus ride from Eastbourne. The walk starts in Seaford and heads east along the coast, passing the Martello Tower and the Seaford Head Nature Reserve. From here there are spectacular views of the Seven Sisters Cliffs and the Cuckmere Valley. It's also a great place for flora and fauna with nationally rare and significant species of plants, birds and insects. The route then follows a riverside path north along the Cuckmere River. It's a very pretty area with species-rich chalk grassland and wildflowers in the summer months. Look out for wildlife which includes a variety of butterflies and wildfowl. The route crosses the Exceat Bridge over the river to enter Seven Sisters Country Park. Here you will find 700 acres of parkland with lots of footpaths and cycling trails. You pick up the South Downs Way here and follow it south through the park to the coast. The next section takes you to Birling Gap where you can visit the National Trust owned Belle Tout lighthouse. It's a good place to stop for refreshments with a nice cafe and great views. The next stage takes you from Birling Gap to Beachy Head. Here you will find the highest chalk sea cliff in Britain, rising to a height of 162 metres (531 ft) with fabulous views along the coast to West Sussex and Dungeness in Kent. The final section descends into Eastbourne, passing along the beach before finishing at the pier. For a longer, marathon length route try our Brighton to Eastbourne Walk .",
