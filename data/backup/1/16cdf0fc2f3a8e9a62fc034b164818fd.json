The estate was absorbed into the residential neighbourhood of Pound Hill and built upon. In the background, it is just possible to see an aircraft that has just taken off from Gatwick airport. The E end of the runway is 2km north of here. Aircraft taking off would not normally be seen from here, as they usually take off into the West (against the prevailing wind). The wind on this day was from the east."

  "description": "This Sussex based town has two lovely local country parks and miles of woodland trails in the forests to the south. There's also a fine local nature reserve and the nearby High Weald AONB to explore on foot. This short easy circular walk in the town visits Worth Park Gardens and Grattons Park, a local nature reserve. It's a very pretty area and has the bonus of a parkside pub to visit afterwards. The walk starts in Worth Park to the north east of the town. The attractive park covers eight hectares and includes formal gardens, a lake area and a series of nice surfaced footpaths. A short walk to the west will take you to Grattons Park. There's a series of pretty ponds, streams and lots of wildlife to see here. To continue your walking around Crawley head west to visit Buchan Country Park. There's 170 acres of woodland, heath, ponds and meadow to explore here. If you head south you can visit Tilgate Forest Park which is one of the walking highlights of the area.",
