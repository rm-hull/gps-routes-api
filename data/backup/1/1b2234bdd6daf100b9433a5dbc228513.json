  "description": "This 5 mile cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line from Stratford Upon Avon to Long Marston. The greenway follows the route of the old Honeybourne Line passing the Stratford Upon Avon Racecourse before crossing the River Avon and the River Stour. You then pass Milcote where there is a nice picnic area with a refurbished railway carriage cafe. It's about half way along the route so a nice place to stop for refreshments. The final section takes you through the countryside to the finish point at the village of Long Marston. The path is flat and well surfaced so it's an ideal ride for families or anyone looking for an easy traffic free ride. If you would like to continue your exercise in the Stratford Upon Avon area you could pick up the towpath of the Stratford Upon Avon Canal and enjoy a waterside cycle or walk. For walkers the long distance Avon Valley Footpath and Monarch's Way both run through the area.",
