    "description": "This circular walk takes you from the North Yorkshire village of Langcliffe to the Victoria Cave and Jubilee Cave. On the way there's some splendid limestone scenery and great views of the atmospheric surrounding landscape. You can start the walk from the public car park in Langcliffe. From here follow footpaths east to the Jubilee Cave. This cave is located on the north side of a small dry valley on the edge of Langcliffe Scar, a few hundred metres north of Victoria Cave. ron Age and Roman material plus artefacts of Mesolithic and Late Palaeolithic have been found in the cave. From the Jubilee Cave you follow tracks a short distance south to reach the Victoria Cave. The significant cave was discovered in 1837, the year of Queen Victoria's coronation. It was found to contain significant fossil remains, including mammoth, straight-tusked elephant, cave bear and hippopotamus, Bos primigenius, Rhinoceros leptorhinus and spotted hyenas. The route then passes the impressive limestone out-croppings at Attermire Scar and Warrendale Knotts. To continue your walking in the area you could try the longer Settle Caves and Waterfalls Walk. The trail visits more caves and local waterfalls including Catrigg Force and Scaleber Force. A little further away there's also the impressive Yordas Cave in Kingsdale. You can explore the cave which includes a large main chamber with a waterfall and a stream running through it.",
