  "description": "Enjoy an easy walk through the pretty Ewyas Harold Common in the Golden Valley of West Hertfordshire. There's some nice trails to follow across the site where you can see meadow saffron, woodland and grazing ponies. You can start the walk from the village and then follow the Herefordshire Trail north to the common. There's some nice grassy footpaths and flora including Rosebay Willowherb, bramble, hawthorn and birch trees. Our Golden Valley Walk runs through the common. You could pick it up and head north through the lovely river valley to Abbey Dore and the remains of Dore Abbey.",
