  "description": "These woods in the Charnwood Forest have a series of good footpaths to try. There's also bridleways suitable for mountain bikers. The woods are located just to the south of Loughborough with car parks at the northern end of the woods off Swithland Road and at the southern end off Roecliffe Road. From here you can pick up the trails taking you through mature oak, birch, alder and lime woodland. There's also a series of pretty streams and lots of woodland wildlife to look out for. In the spring months the forest floor is covered in carpets of lovely bluebells. The woods link with the adjacent Bradgate Country Park where you will find a deer park and a great viewpoint. Just to the  north east you will find the pretty Swithland Reservoir . The reservoir has a nice waterside walking trail with lots of birdlife to look out for on the water. You could also pick up our Charnwood Forest circular walk and visit Beacon Hill Country Park . It's about a two mile walk from the woods to the park where you can climb Beacon Hill for fabulous views over the area.",
