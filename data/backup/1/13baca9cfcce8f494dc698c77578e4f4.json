  "description": "This North London based market town has some nice local parks, several waymarked trails, a historic local hall and waterside trails along the New River which runs past the town. This circular walk from the town visits some of the local walking highlights including Enfield Town Park, Whitewebbs Park , Forty Hall and the New River Path . There's a nice mix of woodland, parkland, gardens and waterside paths to enjoy on the route. It also uses some of the long distance waymarked footpaths that run through the area. The walk starts in the Enfield Town Park, located just south of the town centre and east of the train station. In the park you can follow a trail north along the New River before passing through the town centre to emerge at Hilly Fields and Clay Hill. Here you can pick up a section of the London Loop and follow it north east to Whitewebbs Park, crossing the Cuffley Brook on the way. There's some nice woodland trails in the park, an ornamental pond and some picturesque small lakes. The route then heads south east to pick up the London Loop again and follow it along the Turkey Brook towards Forty Hall. Here you'll find a fine Grade 1 Listed Jacobean Manor House, surrounded by beautiful gardens and a lake. After exploring the hall it's a short walk north east to join with the New River. The man made river has a nice walking trail running south back towards Enfield town.",
