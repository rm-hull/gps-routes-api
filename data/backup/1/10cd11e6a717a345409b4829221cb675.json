  "description": "This National Trust owned limestone ridge has some nice footpaths to try. There's an Iron Age hill fort, wildflowers, butterflies and splendid views across North Somerset, the Bristol Channel and the Mendips. The site includes an extensive hill fort covering 22 acres and commanding fantastic views of the area. It's surrounded by lots of interesting plants of flowers including bell heather, small scabious, early purple orchid and eyebright flower. These attract a wide variety of butterflies in the summer months. Look out for small blues and marbled whites. The route makes use of the Limestone Link which runs through the site. You can follow it east to Burrington Combe and the popular Blagdon Lake to extend your walk. The limestone gorge consists of numerous caves, cliffs and interesting rock formations. The climb to Beacon Batch on Black Down hill starts from the car park at Burrington Combe. The hill is the highest point in the Mendips and provides great views over the lake. Just to the south you will find Rowberrow Warren with miles of mountain bike trails and woodland walks.",
