  "description": "The historic Haughley Park is located just west of the Suffolk village of Haughley. It's a private estate but is sometimes open to the public for special events. For example there are the bluebell walks in April and May where you can explore the estate's woodland trails and enjoy the beautiful landscaped gardens. There's also the fine red brick country house which dates back to 1620 when it was built for the Sulyard family who were very prominent landowners in this area. The nearby village of Haughley is also well worth a visit. The village includes a noteworthy Grade I listed church dating to the medieval period and a Tudor moated farm. There's also a pretty village green and a motte and bailey castle considered to be one of the best-preserved earthworks in the county. The park lies just to the north west of Stowmarket where you can continue your walking along the lovely Gipping Valley River Path .",
