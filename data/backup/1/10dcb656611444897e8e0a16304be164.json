The castle was built in the late 12th century at the behest of Anglo-Norman knight John de Courcy. It was the capital of the Earldom of Ulster. After the earldom's collapse, it remained the only English outpost in Ulster for the next four centuries."

The War Cenotaph features a cannon and full-sized, restored Churchill Mk VII tank, (a tank factory operated in the town during World War II), and the remembrance garden provides a thoughtful space to remember brave borough residents who made the ultimate sacrifice serving their country. Marine Gardens lies on the waterfront of Carrickfergus and is a beautiful parkland within sight of Carrickfergus castle. It consists of 3 distinct spaces with a winding walk as far as Fisherman\u2019s Quay, where visitors can make their return to the castle along the delightful seafront promenade with fantastic views across Belfast Lough and beyond. (around 2km in total). The gardens include an intricate array of paved routes split by sustainable planting and are a popular spot for picnics, playing and relaxing whilst taking in views of the castle and coast. As well as the gardens it incorporates Memorial Area, Clock Tower and Children's Playground. Just a short walk away is a caf\u00e9 and public toilets within the 'Clock Tower.' The clock has been a distinctive feature of the park since it was originally established in 1967 and incorporates a viewing platform over the wide green recreational space."
