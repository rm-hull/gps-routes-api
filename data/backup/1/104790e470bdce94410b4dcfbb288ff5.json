      "caption": "Glaze Brook enters the Manchester Ship Canal. Here, on the border between Cheshire and Salford, the Manchester Ship Canal receives the waters of Glaze Brook (also known as the River Glaze). The Glaze drains a substantial area of mossland hereabouts and was the boundary between the ancient Lancashire Hundreds of West Derby and Salford.This latter fact is recorded on the wall of a bridge near here that carries the A57 road over the Glaze, but as the wall is made of sandstone the lettering is wearing away.This part of the Ship Canal is a canalised section of the River Mersey. The Mersey joined the canal a little way upstream of this point (to the left) and will leave the canal a little further downstream, close to where the River Bollin joins the canal."

This nature reserve has a 173 acre lake and is home to a variety of birdlife. You then follow Glaze Brook and Pennington Brook south to Glazebury and then onto Cadishead on the Manchester Ship Canal. The waymarked walk runs for just under 9 miles, along a flat, easy path so it's suitable for most abilities.",
