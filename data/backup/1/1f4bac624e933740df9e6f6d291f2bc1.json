In the days of horse and cart, carriages had to be dismantled to carry them round the headland! Nowadays, things are a little bit easier as the main A55 North Wales Expressway is carried through the headlands in tunnels. Unlike the Pen-y-Clip tunnels a short way to the west, a good cycle and pedestrian path runs alongside the road round the outside of this headland, approximately along the line of the old (pre-tunnel) road."

  "description": "This seaside resort in Conwy County has some lovely coastal trails, riverside paths, lovely beaches and some local challenging hill climbs to try. This circular walk from the town uses sections of the Wales Coast Path and the North Wales Path to visit Conwy Mountain before climbing to the hills of the Sychnant Pass. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the Wales Coast Path and follow the waymarked trail towards the neighbouring town of Penmaenmawr. You continue along the nice beach here to Conwy Morfa, rounding the golf course before coming to the pretty marina. There's nice views here over the Conwy River estuary. In the town you pick up the North Wales Path and follow it west up to Conwy Mountain. There's wonderful views here to the coast and surrounding hills of Snowdonia. Follow the elevated path south and it will take you to Capelulo, Maen Esgob, Waen Gyrach, Cefn Coch and Moelfre. The route then descends to the Llanfairfechan River which you can follow back into the town.",

      "content": "Just to the south west of the Conwy Mountain you will pass close to the Jubilee Path. The elevated path was constructed in 1887 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. It offers fine views to the sea and has a small car park for access. There's also the option of climbing to Foel Lus in this area. The climb to Foel Fras starts from the town. You can follow footpaths south to Drum and then onto the summit which stands at a height of 942 m (3,091 ft) making it one of the Welsh 3000s (mountains over 3000ft high). From the high pint there are wonderful views over Carneddau and the rest of Snowdonia. A few miles south west of the town there's one of the walking highlights of the area at the beautiful Aber Falls in Abergwyngregyn. The 120 ft high falls are part of the stunning scenery of the Coedydd National Nature Reserve with its wonderful woodland and mountain scenery. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
