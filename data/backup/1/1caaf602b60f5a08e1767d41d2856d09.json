Dowsett was instrumental in starting a public collection which resulted in the memorial stone being erected in 1902. Another cross on the same route was at Holden, Haslingden"

  "description": "A circular walk around Holcombe Moor visiting Peel Tower on the way. The moorland is owned by the National Trust and a popular place for walkers, cyclists and bird watchers. The walk starts from the public car park in the village of Holcombe on Lumb Carr Road. From here it is a short walk up to Peel Tower, just to the north east. The tower is dedicated to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th century Prime Minister considered the father of modern British policing. There are fabulous over the surrounding area from the elevated position of the tower. The route then follows a footpath north to the Pilgrim's Cross. This notable landmark includes a cubed shaped monument whose sides tell the story and history of the cross. It dates all the way back to A.D. 1176 and was the site where Pilgrims to Whalley Abbey prayed and rested. After examining the cross the route continues north towards Beetle Hill. Here you turn east along a section of the Rossendale Way before picking up a bridleway track to take you back to Holcombe.",

      "content": "The area is also an army training camp and is sometimes used for live firing. Red flags by day and red lamps by night indicate that live firing is taking place. The range Danger Area is strictly out of bounds to the public on these occasions. The public have access to the public rights of way on the remainder of the training area at all times, but should be aware that dry training may be in progress with blank and pyrotechnic ammunition. You can find out more about the firing times by clicking here. There are a number of pretty reservoirs in the area with waterside walking trails. Head west and you can visit the expansive Wayoh Reservoir while to the north you'll find Calf Hey Reservoir. Also nearby are the climbs to Musbury Tor and the Haslingden Halo. These are both great viewpoints with an impressive art structure to see at the latter. Just south of Ramsbottom there's the worthy Redisher Wood to explore. In the woods there are peaceful woodland trails and water features including the Holcombe Brook, a picturesque lake and photogenic waterfalls. The circular Stubbins Estate Walk takes you to the Tentering Tower, a ruined industrial building on the eastern side of the moor. For more walking ideas in the county see the Lancashire Walks page."
