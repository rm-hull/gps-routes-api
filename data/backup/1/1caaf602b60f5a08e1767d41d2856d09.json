Dowsett was instrumental in starting a public collection which resulted in the memorial stone being erected in 1902. Another cross on the same route was at Holden, Haslingden"

  "description": "A circular walk around Holcombe Moor visiting Peel Tower on the way. The moorland is owned by the National Trust and a popular place for walkers, cyclists and bird watchers. The walk starts from the public car park in the village of Holcombe on Lumb Carr Road. From here it is a short walk up to Peel Tower, just to the north east. The tower is dedicated to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th century Prime Minister considered the father of modern British policing. There are fabulous over the surrounding area from the elevated position of the tower. The route then follows a footpath north to the Pilgrim's Cross. This notable landmark includes a cubed shaped monument whose sides tell the story and history of the cross. It dates all the way back to A.D. 1176 and was the site where Pilgrims to Whalley Abbey prayed and rested. After examining the cross the route continues north towards Beetle Hill. Here you turn east along a section of the Rossendale Way before picking up a bridleway track to take you back to Holcombe.",
