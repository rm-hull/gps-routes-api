As well as being visited by anglers, St. Mullins is one of the stop-off points for pleasure barges and cruisers who transit the River Barrow. The building of the canal on the Barrow began here in 1750 and the Old Grain Store was built to store goods coming up the river from the sailing ships in New Ross."

  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of the Barrow Way from Graiguenamanagh to St Mullins in County Carlow. The route starts in Graiguenamanagh and heads south, running along the River Barrow for a distance of just under 8km (4.5 miles). It's a particularly scenic stretch of the river which inlcudes the Barrow Navigation Canal where there are some pretty locks. It's a fairly flat path with some sections suitable for cycling. The walk finishes at the historic village of St Mullins which also marks the end of the Barrow Way.",
