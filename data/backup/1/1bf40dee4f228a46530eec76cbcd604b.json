  "description": "A circular walk from Avoncliff, visiting the impressive Avoncliff Aqueduct, the Kennet and Avon Canal and the River Avon. You can start the walk from the car park on the south side of the river in Avoncliff. The train station is also nearby and makes an alternative start point. From here you can directly access the aqueduct which carries the Kennet and Avon Canal and the Bath to Westbury railway line over the River Avon. It was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas, between 1797 and 1801 and is a Grade II listed building. From its elevated position there are fine views over the river below. After crossing the structure you can then pick up the Kennet and Avon Canal and follow the towpath west. After about a quarter of a mile you can cross the canal and follow paths along other side of the canal back to the aqueduct. To extend your walk you can continue along the towpath into Bath. Heading east will take you into Bradford on Avon where you can try our Bradford on Avon Canal and River Walk. Heading west will take you to Dundas Aqueduct, a Scheduled Ancient Monument which is well worth a visit. Also nearby is Barton Farm Country Park. Here you will find historic buildings, craft shops and tea rooms while the farmhouse, granary and tithe barn of the original Barton Farm date back to the 14th century.",
