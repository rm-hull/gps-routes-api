  "description": "This walk takes you along a lovely section of the Thames Path from Lechlade to Kelmscott. It's just over 3.5 miles along the flat riverside path, so around 7 miles there and back. On the way you will pass the noteworthy St. Mary's Church at Buscot. The Grade I listed church dates to 1200 and is worthy of further investigation with its stained glass and ancient bells. Also of interest is the statue of Old Father Thames at St John's Lock. The pretty lock is one of the highlights of this stretch of the river and includes the photogenic statue which dates from 1851 when it was originally comissioned for The Crystal Palace's grounds in London. Near the lock you will also pass the point where the River Cole enters the River Thames. In Kelmscott you can pay a visit to the historic Kelmscott Manor. The Cotswold stone house was built in about 1570 and was the country home of textile designer, poet, artist and writer William Morris. The manor is open to the public in the summer months. For a fee you can explore the wonderful architecture of the house and enjoy a stroll through the lovely gardens. You can extend the walk by heading south to another local historical highlight at Buscot Park. Here you can explore the picturesque grounds and gardens surrounding a fine 18th-century mansion. If you continued east along the river you would soon come to Tadpole Bridge where you'll find a significant 13th century bridge and the popular Trout Inn.",
