  "description": "This attractive bay is located just north of Craster on the Northumberland coast. It's a popular spot with a car park, lovely beach, interesting flora and lots of wildlife to see. This circular walk from Embleton Bay visits Dunstanburgh Castle, Craster and the village of Embleton. The walk starts at the Embleton Bay car park, though you could start from the village if you prefer. From here you can pick up the coastal path and follow it south along the bay with its lovely beach and dunes. After passing Greymare rock you will come to the photogenic ruins of the historic Dunstanburgh Castle. The route continues south to the delightful seaside village of Craster with its picturesque harbour. You then head inland to pick up countryside footpaths to take you north to Embleton village. After exploring the village you can follow the country lane back to the car park on the coast. The bay is great for wildlife so keep your eyes peeled for eider ducks, fulmars, kittiwake, and shags as you make your way along the coastal section.",
