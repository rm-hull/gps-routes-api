  "description": "This super country park is situated just a few miles from Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth. There are lovely cycling and walking paths around the large lake which is 2.5 miles long. The lake is surrounded by peaceful woods where there are nice shady trails to try. You can follow footpaths along the Angles Way public footpath on the western side of the lake. Please stick to this section as the central and eastern parts are private property. The Angles Way long distance path runs past the site so you could pick this up and head north to visit the impressive Roman Fort at Burgh Castle. If you follow the trail south you can visit Somerleyton. The delightful model village includes thatched red-brick estate cottages and the splendid Somerleyton Hall.",
