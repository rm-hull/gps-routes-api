  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Loch Chon and the Loch Ard Forest in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The walk starts from the car parking area on the eastern side of the loch, near to the campsite. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north along the loch with views towards Heron Island in the centre. The paths will take you up to the Loch Ard Forest where you can follow woodland paths south west past Frenich Farm. You then follow trails on the western side of the water before crossing the Water of Chon near the little Loch Dhu. The route then heads north west to return you to the car park.",

To the north there's Loch Arklet and Loch Katrine to explore. Loch Achray, Loch Venachar and Loch Drunkie lie to the east. At Loch Achray you can start the popular climb to Ben Venue. For more walking ideas in the area see the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs Walks and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park page."
