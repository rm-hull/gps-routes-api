  "description": "The Rhyd Ddu Path is one of the six main routes to the summit of the highest mountain in Wales. It is considered to be one of the quietest and most beautiful, though there are some challenging sections where care should be taken. The path begins in the car park in the village of Rhyd Ddu and ascends to Pen ar Lon, Rhos Boeth and Llechog, before reaching the 1,085 metres (3,560 ft) summit. On the asent you will enjoy magnificent views of Llyn y Gadair and Llyn Cwellyn lakes, and the summits of Moel Hebog, Moel yr Ogof, Moel Lefn, Mynydd Drws y Coed and Mynydd Mawr. From the Snowdon summit there are views over Snowdonia, Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Peak District and the Lake District. For an exhilarating circular ridge walk, taking in the Crib Goch ridge, try the Snowdon Horseshoe .",

      "content": "The climb to Mynydd Mawr also starts from the village. Follow the path north west and it will take you past Llyn Cwellyn to the summit where there are interesting geological formations, rocky outcrops and breathtakingly beautiful views to enjoy. Just to the west of the village you can explore the Dorothea Quarry where you'll find the remains of the old mining houses and a series of scenic lakes including Llyn Nantlle Uchaf. The quarry is one of the significant sites on the Snowdonia Slate Trail which runs through the area. The circular long distance trail can be used to visit several of the other historic mining areas located in the World Heritage Site. Heading north along the trail would take you to Dinorwic Quarry which was at one time the second largest slate quarry in the world. The quarry is located on the edge of Padarn Country Park where there are some lovely waterside trails along Llyn Padarn and Llyn Peris. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
