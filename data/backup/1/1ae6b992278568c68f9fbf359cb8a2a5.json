The line was part of a series of projects proposed in the 19th century, aiming to establish north-south connections linking Great Dunmow with Epping, Halstead, and/or Saffron Walden. Initially proposed by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) in 1859, the route was eventually constructed by the Great Eastern Railway (GER), which had absorbed the ECR. Construction commenced in 1864, and the line became operational on 22 February 1869, serving Takeley, Felstead, and Rayne. Easton Lodge was added to the route in 1894, followed by Hockerill in 1910, and StaneStreet and Bannister Green in 1922."

Additionally, goods sidings were established at various points, including Hockerill Halt, Takeley, and Easton Lodge, to cater to the needs of US Air Force bases at Stansted and Easton Lodge. Other goods sidings were located at Dunmow and Felsted, primarily serving general purposes and facilitating transportation for the nearby sugar beet factory at Rayne."

A viaduct spanning the River Chelmer to the south of Great Dunmow was dismantled during the 1970s to accommodate the construction of the A1256 Great Dunmow bypass. Initially, passenger traffic on the railway line was relatively robust upon its opening. However, increased competition from bus and road transportation led to dwindling train occupancy, with trains operating nearly empty by the time passenger services ceased on 3 March 1952. Although the line continued to operate for freight purposes until the end of 1971, it eventually shut down entirely in 1972."
