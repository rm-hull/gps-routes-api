This regional walking route, also known as \"The Link\" connects Scalby Mills at Scarborough to Helmsley via footpaths and country roads across the limestone escarpments known as The Tabular Hills. The idea of this route was conceived by the North Yorkshire National Park Authority as a means of connecting the start of the Cleveland Way at Helmsley and the end of it in Filey. This permits long distance walkers with a means of returning to Helmsley via a beautiful 48 mile route after completing the 110 mile long Cleveland Way at Filey. Two route guides are available for the Tabular Hills Walk - one by Cicerone and another available from the National Park Authority at their centres at Sutton Bank or Helmsley."

  "description": "This long distance trail takes you across the southern boundary of the North York Moors National Park. The waymarked path takes you from the coast at Scarborough to Helmsley Circular Walk in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire. The route starts at Scalby Mills just north of Scarborough and heads west along the pretty Scarborough Sea Cut and Scalby Beck to Wykeham Forest . The woods consist mainly of pine trees with some great viewpoints to visit such as the Raptor viewpoint where you can look out for buzzards and crossbills. The next stage takes you through Dalby Forest where you pass the fascinating Bridestones with its fascinating sandstone sculptures. The route continues to another major walk highlight at the beautiful natural amphitheatre known as the Hole of Horcum shortly before crossing Levisham Moor to take you to Levisham, near Pickering . The route then skirts the southern edge of Cropton Forest before coming to the delightfully scenic village of Hutton-le-Hole . Look out for sheep roaming the streets at will in this typically picturesque North York Moors village. You continue west through Gillamoor, Kirk Dale, Riccal Dale and Ash Dale before coming to the finish point at Helmsley, next to the beautiful Duncombe Park . It's a fabulous and varied walk with some gentle climbs, steeper challenging climbs, long woodland sections and amazing views. It's waymarked with a green and purple circular disc. The walk links with Cleveland Way allowing you to turn it into a long distance circular walk.",
