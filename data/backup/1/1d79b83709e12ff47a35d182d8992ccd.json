The viaduct consists of seven arches, 10m apart, with the piers being 1.5m wide. The piers and abutments are made of ashlar blackstone, whilst the parapets, which stand a metre above arch level, are coped with chamfered sandstone.[1]\u00a0The viaduct stands at 23 metres tall. Construction began in 1860 and was completed the following year, opening to railway traffic in 1863 with the first train on 13 July that year. \nIt was designed by Thomas Jackson of Messrs Greene & King, who built the line from\u00a0Knockmore\u00a0to\u00a0Banbridge. Jackson was also responsible for designing\u00a0Hillsborough\u00a0and\u00a0Dromore\u00a0railway stations"
