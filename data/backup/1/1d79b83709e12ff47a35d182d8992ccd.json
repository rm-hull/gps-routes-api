      "caption": "Dromore Viaduct from Kilntown. The viaduct is roughly 101m long and 6m wide, having been built to carry only a single track. The viaduct consists of seven arches, 10m apart, with the piers being 1.5m wide. The piers and abutments are made of ashlar blackstone, whilst the parapets, which stand a metre above arch level, are coped with chamfered sandstone.[1] The viaduct stands at 23 metres tall. Construction began in 1860 and was completed the following year, opening to railway traffic in 1863 with the first train on 13 July that year. It was designed by Thomas Jackson of Messrs Greene & King, who built the line from Knockmore to Banbridge. Jackson was also responsible for designing Hillsborough and Dromore railway stations"
