  "description": "This country park in Billingham is the perfect place for a peaceful afternoon stroll. The park consists of grassland, a lake, a series of ponds and a beck flows which around the boundary of the park. The lake is fantastic for birdwatching - look out for coot, pochard, swans, grebes, herons and the tufted duck. For cyclists National Cycle Route 14 runs through the park. Just to the west of the park you will find Wynyard Woodland Park which is a great place to extend your woodland walking. Head south west and you can visit Coatham Woods where there's more nice trails and wildlife to see.",
