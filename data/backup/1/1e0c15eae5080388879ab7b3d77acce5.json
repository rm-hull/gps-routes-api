  "description": "This Cumbrian village is located on the coast on the edge of the Lake District National Park. The village is a nice place for a walk with coastal trails and nature reserves to explore. It's also accessible by public transport with a train station on the Cumbrian Coast Line, which runs between Carlisle and Barrow-in-Furness. This walk from the village follows the Cumbria Coastal Way to the Drigg Beach Nature Reserve and then on to the neighbouring village of Ravenglass. The area is a great for wildlife with lots of wading birds to spot on the river estuaries. There's also the option of extending the walk in Ravenglass by visiting the splendid Muncaster Castle .",

      "content": "Just a few miles inland you'll find the neighbouring village of Gosforth. It's well worth a visit with a 17th century pub, a 12th century church and an ancient Viking cross to see. The circular walk from the village explores Blengdale and the River Bleng with some pleasant riverside paths and woodland trails through Blengale Forest."
