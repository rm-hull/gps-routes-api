  "description": "This park in the Orrell area of Greater Manchester includes two pretty reservoirs surrounded by attractive woodland and a buttercup meadow. There's nice easy footpaths to follow around the water with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. To extend the walk head south towards Longshaw to climb Billinge Hill. The hill is the highest point on Merseyside and only about a mile or so from the park. From the summit there's great views towards Great Orme in Wales, Blackpool tower, Greater Manchester, Winter Hill and the Derbyshire Peak District. You could also pick up the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and enjoy an easy towpath stroll on our Wigan Canal Walk. Here you can explore the lovely Wigan Flashes Nature Reserve where there's an abundance of water loving wildlife to see. The park is located only a few miles west of Wigan and the canal.",
