The route runs for a distance of just over 6 miles with some pleasant views of the surrounding countryside to enjoy on the way. Start the walk in Ullesthorpe and follow the old railway line north to Leire. Here you can pick up the Leicestershire Round and follow the waymarked footpath west to visit Frolesworth. Head south from here and the trail will take you to Claybrook Magna where you can pick up a country lane to return you to Ullesthorpe.",
