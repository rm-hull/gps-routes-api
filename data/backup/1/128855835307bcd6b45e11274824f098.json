  "description": "This long route makes use of the Three Choirs Way and the old route of the Worcestershire Way to create a circular walk through the Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There's fabulous views over the counties of Herefordshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire throughout. The walk starts North Malvern at the main parking area next to the hills. You then follows footpaths up to Table Hill and Sugarloaf Hill before coming to the high point at the range at Worcestershire Beacon. You continue south past Summer Hill, Black Hill and Jubilee Hill before coming to Herefordshire Beacon and British Camp where there's a fascinating Iron Age Hillfort. At Hangman's Hill you turn north and follow footpaths to Colwall Stone and West Malvern. Here you pick up some woodland trails through Six Acre Wood before returning to the car park.",
