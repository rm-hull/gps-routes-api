  "description": "This circular walk from the idyllic Dorset village of Evershot visits the delightful Melbury Park. Evershot is very pretty with a fine old church, lots of thatched cottages and a noteworthy 16th century inn to relax in after your exercise. The village has strong connections with author Thomas Hardy who called it 'Evershead' in his fictional Wessex. The walk starts in Evershot where you can pick up the Macmillan Way and follow the waymarked trail north toward Melbury Sampford and Melbury Park. Here you'll find attractive parkland and woodland where you may spot the odd deer. There's also the Grade I listed Melbury House which dates back to 1500. You continue north to Melbury Osmond which also has associations with Thomas Hardy. His parents were married at the church here with his mother's old cottage also nearby. From the village you then turn west towards Lewcombe. Here you pick up the Macmillan Way Link and head south past East Chelborough to Girt Lane before turning east to return to the village.",

      "content": "The Acorn Inn is a fine place for some post walk rest and refreshment. It's an historic pub of some note, dating all the way back to the 16th century when it was originally a coaching inn. The Acorn Inn featured as 'The Sow and Acorn' in Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Tess Cottage in the village is named after that novel's eponymous heroine, who stayed in a fictional version of it when visiting 'Evershead'. The inn still has a charming interior with atmospheric old beams, oak panelling, roaring fires and an original skittle alley. They serve high quality food and also have a lovely garden area for warmer days. You can find them at postcode DT2 0JW for your sat navs."
