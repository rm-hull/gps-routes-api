The story goes that he was shipwrecked while sailing in the Irish sea and rescued and looked after by the local community. Out of gratitude he built the first church near here. That church was lost to coastal erosion and this is at least the third, possibly the seventh on or near the site."

  "description": "This walk follows a lovely section of the Ceredigion Coast Path from New Quay to Aberaeron. It runs for just over 5 miles on an undulating path with wonderful scenery throughout. It's also a great area for wildlife with Dolphins, Seals, Chough, and Red Kites to look out for on the way. The walk starts in New Quay next to the pier and the harbour. The popular seaside town includes a number of picturesque homes, a harbour, lovely beaches, quality restaurants and fine views over Cardigan Bay. You then follow the trail east along New Quay Bay and beach towards Pont Llanina and Little Quay Bay. The trail then climbs to the cliff top path at Craig Ddu before passing the Afon Drywi and a waterfall and descending into Aberaeron. You can extend the walk by continuing along the coast on the Aberaeron to Llanerchaeron Walk. You could also head south on the New Quay To Cwmtydu Walk and visit the delightful village of Cwmtydu with its pretty cove, beach and deep wooded valley.",
