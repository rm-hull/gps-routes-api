  "description": "This circular walk follows the footpath around this lovely reservoir in upper Teesdale. The reservoir is surrounded by the Lune Valley countryside and woodland. The route runs for just over 3 miles on a fairly flat path so suitable for most abilities. Grassholme Reservoir is located a few miles south of Middleton in Teesdale . The Pennine Way runs past the reservoir so you could pick this up and head south to Balderhead, Blackton and Hury Reservoirs to extend your walk.",
