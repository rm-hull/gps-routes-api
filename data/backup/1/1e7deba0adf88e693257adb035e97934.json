This 'walk' is only possible from half ebb to half flood tide over low tide and traverses the base of the cliff at Kincraig, in places utilising chains both horizontal and vertically to ascend and descend short sections.It runs for around a quarter of a mile. Steps have also been cut in the rock. A most enjoyable adventure with much of geological interest. Whilst nowhere difficult care needs to be taken and it does need a certain stamina and head for heights.It can be easily avoided by taking the path over the top of the cliff."

  "description": "This exhilarating scramble and climb takes you along a rocky path in Elie and Earlsferry, on the Fife Coast. You'll follow the chain along a challenging trail which requires a fair degree of nerve, skill and balance. Please also note that the route should not be attempted at high tide. You should check tide times before you go and be sure to start the chain section of the walk at least two hours before high tide. The full walk from Elie should obviously be started even earlier as it takes nearly an hour to reach the chain section from the town. The walk starts at the public car parking area in the village of Elie. From here you can follow the Fife Coastal Path west towards Earlsferry and its golf course. Around Kincraig you can pick up the Chain Walk and continue west past Macduff's Cave, Kincraig Point and Devil's Cave. You'll pass some splendid rock formations and enjoy some stunning coastal views as you make your way along the path. Please be sure to take great care as you make your way along the uneven and often steep surfaces. Good footwear is essential for this walk.",
