  "description": "This village east of Bath has some nice waterside trails along the River Avon and the Kennet and Avon Canal. There's also some hills climbs to the south of the village on Bathampton Rocks and Bathampton Down. This walk from the village visits the neighbouring settlements of Claverton, Monkton Coombe and Limpley Stoke. On the way you'll enjoy waterside paths along the Kennet and Avon Canal and a visit to the wonderful American Museum in Claverton. The museum includes informative exhibitions and 125 acres of beautiful gardens and grounds. There's also a climb to Bathampton Down above the village. Here you can enjoy splendid views over the surrounding area. The walk starts on the canal in the village. You can follow the towpath south and it will take you to Claverton where there's a Grade II listed pumping house and a church which dates from the 13th century. On this section you'll also pass close to the lovely Bathampton Meadows next to the River Avon. Here you'll find wet meadows and an oxbow lake which attract birds such as dunlin, ringed and little ringed plover and common sandpiper. The route continues south before leaving the canal to visit the pretty little village of Monkton Combe where there's a notable public school. The route then heads south east to visit Limpley Stoke near Freshford. There's a noteworthy 13th century to church to explore in Limpley Stoke before continuing the walk. After exploring the villages the route retuns to the canal to follow it back to Claverton. Here you leave the canal and pass the American Museum. The museum is well worth a visit if you have time. It takes you on a journey through the history of America with exhibitions and a fine collection of folk and decorative arts. There's also 125 acres of grounds with views of the Limpley Stoke Valley and the River Avon. See the video below for an idea of what you will find at this excellent local attraction. From the museum you head north to climb up to Bathampton Down. There are some nice elevated footpaths past the golf course which will lead you back to Bathampton.",
