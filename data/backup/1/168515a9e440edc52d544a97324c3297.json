It rises five miles south of Warminster and flows north to the town; this uppermost reach is sometimes referred to as 'The Deverill Brook'. Turning westward, it flows for another sixteen miles to join the Nadder just below Wilton, shortly before the latter reaches the Avon at Salisbury a mile or so further on. Looking upstream."

  "description": "Follow the River Wylye through Wiltshire on this interesting and varied waterside walk. You start at the splendid Stourhead - an 18th century landscaped garden owned by the National Trust. The route then follows the river through a series of pretty riverside villages including Kingston Deverill, Monkton Deverill and Longbridge Deverill, before a wooded section through Southleigh Wood on the outskirts of Warminster. The second section takes you through Heytesbury, Codford St Peter and Great Wishford to the finish point at the splendid Wilton House near Salisbury.",
