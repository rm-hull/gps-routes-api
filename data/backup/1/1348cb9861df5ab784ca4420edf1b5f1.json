  "description": "This country park is located near Wokingham in Berkshire and has two lovely short walks. The Longmoor Lake walk is about a mile while The Woodland Walk is about two miles. The paths are well laid out while there are also boardwalks passing above the bogland. The park has various facilities including a cafe, paddling pool, and an adventure play area. There are also opportunities for wildlife watching particularly at Longmoor Lake. Just to the south east you can continue your walking around Finchampstead Ridges near Crowthorne. There's peaceful woodland trails and fine view of the River Blackwater Valley here. A few miles to the north there's Dinton Pastures Country Park. There are a series of large lakes here with water sports and wildlife to enjoy.",
