The kiln dates from 1860 and is situated at the easternmost point of the carboniferous limestone outcrops that continue into Wharfedale. By 1860 there was a railway at nearby Pateley Bridge, so the lime could be exported. The only problem was the steep hill down to the town. On one occasion it is recorded that a great crowd turned out to see a steam traction engine pulling a wagon up the hill to the lime works."

  "description": "This walk visits the photogenic Coldstones Cut, a huge public artwork on Greenhow Hill in North Yorkshire. You can start the walk from the Coldstones Cut Parking Area near the Toft Gate Lime Kiln. From here you can follow footpaths south to the viewing platform. There's wonderful views over the site and also towards the surrounding hills and countryside from this elevated spot. After admiring the views you can then explore the site on different winding footpaths. It's an unusual and fascinating walk taking you around the old quarry while complementing the surrounding landscape of the Nidderdale AONB. The historic lime kilns at the start of the walk are also worth exploring. They date back to the mid 19th century are and are some of the most significant in the country.",
