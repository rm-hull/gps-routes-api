  "description": "Explore 3000 acres of parkland and woodland on this fine circular walk in Cirencester. This extensive park has miles of woodland trails, a large lake and a deer park. You can walk along the wonderful tree lined Broad Ride and visit the 19th century Polo-ground - the oldest in Great Britain. There are also great views into the surrounding Cotswolds countryside. The park entrance is located on the western side of the town centre so is easy to reach. The Monarch's Way and the Macmillan Way both run past the park so you could pick up these trails to continue your walking in the area.",
