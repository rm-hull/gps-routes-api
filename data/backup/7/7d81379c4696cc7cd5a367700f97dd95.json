  "description": "Enjoy a stroll around the pretty lakes in this country park in Peterborough. There's 85 acres to explore with a series of footpaths taking you around the meadows, woodland and lakes. Look out for butterflies such as the black hairstreak and grizzled skipper. You may also see muntjac deer, badger and fox. The park is located just to the south of Peterborough town centre. If you'd like to extend your walk then you could head to the nearby Ferry Meadows Country Park for more waterside footpaths.",
