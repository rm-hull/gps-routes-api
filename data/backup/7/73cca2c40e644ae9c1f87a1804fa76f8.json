  "description": "Follow the lakeside cycle lanes around this lovely reservoir on this circular ride in Powys. The country lanes around the water are flat and well maintained so this is a farily easy waterside ride. It's a lovely area with the lake surrounded by hills and attractive woodland. You can hire bikes at Llandwddyn at the southern end of the water. This route starts from the visitor centre near the village of Llanwddyn and the impressive Vyrnwy Dam. You then follow the B4393 around the water for about 12 miles. The whole of this route is probably more suitable for cyclists but walkers can enjoy the reserve too. There's nice paths at the southern end of the water near the visitor centre, including a sculpture trail. There's also woodland trails on both the western and eastern side of the lake. At the northern end of the lake you will find the beautiful Rhiwargor Waterfall . There's a nice track running along the Afon Eiddew to the spectacular waterfall. At the southern end you can pick up the Glyndwr's Way long distance footpath. The waymarked trail can be used to explore the nearby Dyfnant Forest. The area is also a RSPB nature reserve so you can look out for a variety of birds including great crested grebes, dippers and buzzards. There are bird hides around the lake. You can follow the trail using the google street view link below.",
