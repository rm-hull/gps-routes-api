  "description": "Follow the Cleveland Street Walk from Guisborough to Loftus through lovely rolling Yorkshire countryside. The path starts at the dramatic 12th century Guisborough Priory and heads east towards the coast through Slapewath, North Skelton and Skinningrove before finishing at Loftus. Highlights on the path include the 11 arch Waterfall viaduct near Spa Wood and views of Margrove Park which is just to the south of the path near Boosbeck. The path also passes a series of dismantled railway lines and the Guisborough Forest and Walkway where there's cycle trails, walking routes, bridleways, a trim trail and an easier sculpture trail.",
