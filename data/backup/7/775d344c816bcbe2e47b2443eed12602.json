  "description": "This route uses sections of the St Edmund Way , the Essex Way and the Stour Valley Path to create a circular walk around this Suffolk based village. It's a very pretty settlement with many cottages and old timber-framed houses. There's also a noteworthy village church which dates from the 15th century and features several times in\u00a0John Constable's paintings. The route runs for about 14 miles, visiting the neighbouring settlements of Nayland, Langham and Stratford St Mary. On the way there's lovely Constable country scenery and views of the River Stour to enjoy. The walk starts in Stoke By Nayland where you can pick up the St Edmund Way and follow it west and then south to Nayland. Here you cross the River Stour on Nayland Bridge before continuing south east to Boxted where you pick up the Essex Way. Follow it east and it will take you to Langham where you turn north towards Stratford St Mary. Here you pick up the Stour Valley Path and follow the waymarked trail along the river for a while before passing Thornington Hall . This old hall dates from 1600 and is owned by the National Trust. It\u00a0is a picturesque place and one of the best timber-framed houses in Suffolk. After passing the old hall you continue north towards Gifford's Hall and Withermarsh Green before turning west to return to Stoke By Nayland.",
