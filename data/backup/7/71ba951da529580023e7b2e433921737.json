  "description": "This Sussex based village is located near Crowborough and Tunbridge Wells in the north eastern part of the county. Mayfield is close to the Ashdown Forest where you can enjoy miles of woodland trails in the 'home' of Winnie-the-Pooh. There's also the High Weald AONB where you'll find numerous walking trails in beautiful surroundings. The historic village itself includes some wonderful old listed buildings including a fine 16th century pub and a 15th century church. This circular walk explores the area to the south of the village using various public footpaths. On the way there's pleasant countryside, woodland paths and views of the River Rother.",
