      "caption": "Hascombe Hill fort. The site was excavated in 1931 by S. E. Winbolt, who dated the occupation of the site to the 1st century BC. The hillfort encloses a thickly wooded area of approximately 2.4 hectares (6 acres). The sides of the fort, which are naturally very steep, were scarped at the top to make them almost unassailable. Encircling the crest of the hill is a defensive ditch 1.5 metres (5 ft) deep. The defences are reinforced on the northeast side (where the hillfort joins the rest of the hill) with a strong line of ramparts and ditches broken by a single entrance passage some 24 metres (80 ft) long."

In the early 19th century the hill became an important naval telegraph station, using a mechanical form of semaphore to communicate with Netley Heath in Surrey on one side and Blackdown in Sussex on the other. A chain of such stations linked London with Portsmouth. The height of Hascombe Hill is 644 feet."

  "description": "This walk climbs to an Iron Age Hillfort and stone circle, near the village of Hascombe in the Surrey Hills. The walk starts from the attractive Hascombe village which lies just north of the hill. From here you can follow footpaths south through peaceful woodland to the hill top. Here you can explore the ancient fort and enjoy some fine views over the surrounding Surrey countryside. On the slopes of the hill there's also a photogenic stone circle built by the Megalithic Order of Druids in 1995/97. The Greensand Way passes through the village so it's easy to continue your walking on this popular long distance path. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Hascombe. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
