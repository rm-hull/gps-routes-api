  "description": "Follow public footpaths and country lanes from the New Forest to the coast. The route heads through some nice woodland around Brockenhurst before passing through attractive farmland on your way to the coast. Here you follow a lovely coastal path around Keyhaven Marshes into Lymington town centre. The walk starts in Brockenhurst, near the train station. You then follow country lanes and bridleways south east through Brockenhurst Park and Roydon Woods to Setley Common. Public footpaths then take you past Battramsley to Shirly Holms Farm. The route continues south through Upper Pennington before following Avon Water to the beautiful Keyhaven Marshes. Here you pick up a coastal section along the Solent Way on the sea wall. This section has great views of the Isle of Wight and lots of wildlife to look out for in the marshes. After a few miles the trail comes into Lymington, passing along the pretty harbour before finishing at the train station where you can catch a train back to Brockenhurst. In Lymington you also have the option of catching the ferry to the Isle of Wight where there are fantastic coastal walking trails.",
