  "description": "Explore the beautiful Wirral Peninsula on this circular cycling and walking trail. The 60 km (37 mile) trail starts at the Seacombe Ferry Terminal and visits Wallasey, Hoylake, Heswall and Neston . Along the way there's splendid views over the Mersey to the city of Liverpool on the eastern side of the peninsula. At the northern end around Hoylake you can look out upon the estuary of the River Dee and the Irish Sea. On the western side you will pass West Kirby and the splendid Wirral Country Park with boulder-clay cliffs and more great views of the Dee Estuary and the lovely Hilbre Island . You can visit the island at low tide and look out for grey seals. Other highlights include Eastham Country Park on the eastern side of the Wirral. Here you'll find 100 acres of broadleaf woodland with surfaced walking paths and a cycle track. You will also pass the fascinating model village at Port Sunlight and the delightful village of Parkgate with its marshes and wide variety of birdlife.",
