  "description": "An easy circular walk around the delightful Llyn Geirionydd in the Gwydyr Forest area of the Snowdonia National Park. It's a very peaceful area with great views of the Carneddau mountains and the woodland surrounding the lake. You can start the walk from the car park at the south eastern end of the lake. There's a picnic area and toilets here too. Follow the little country lane along the eastern side of the water before crossing the River Geirionydd at the northern end. A public footpath then runs along the western side of the lake, just below Mynydd Deulyn. If you head west you can enjoy two more lovely reservoir walks at Llyn Cowlyd and Llyn Crafnant. Llyn Cowlyd is the deepest lake in North Wales and has more nice waterside trails. Llyn Crafnant has a fine circular trail with a lakeside cafe which also hires rowing boats. You could also follow the trails along the River Geirionydd at the northern end of the water or pick up the woodland trails in the surrounding forests. The lake is located near to the village of Trefriw where you can enjoy a little walk along the delightful Fairy Falls .",
