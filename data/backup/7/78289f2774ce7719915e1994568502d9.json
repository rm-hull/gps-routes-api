  "description": "This walk takes you through the stunning Gower AONB from Penlle'r Castell in the north, to Rhossili on the Gower Peninsula, in the south. The route was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales in 1998 and takes you past a variety of impressive historical sites, including ancient cairns, standing stones and Norman chapels. The first section runs from Penlle'r Castell to Gowerton, passing the Lliw Reservoirs, before crossing the River Lliw a Gorseinon. The second section runs from Gowerton to Penmaen where you can enjoy splendid coastal views of Oxwich Bay. The final section runs from Penmaen to Rhossili, with a climb to the sandstone ridge of Cefn Bryn where there are more fabulous views of the Gower Peninsula. At Rhossili you can enjoy wonderful views over Rhossili Bay and Worm's Head. This unusual promontory, is shaped like a giant sea-serpent and marks the most westerly tip of Gower. It is possible to walk to Worm's Head but only when the tide is out so check tide times before if you intend to extend your walk here. The walk is waymarked with a black, green and yellow disc.",
