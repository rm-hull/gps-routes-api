  "description": "Enjoy an easy walk along the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal on this waterside walk in Gloucestershire. The route runs from the village of Frampton on Severn to Purton, passing the lovely Slimbridge Nature Reserve on the way. The walk runs along easy, flat paths for just over 6 miles (so 12 miles there and back). It's a very picturesque section of the canal with nice views of the surrounding countryside and the River Severn to enjoy. The walk starts on Fretherne Bridge, just to the east of the village centre. From here you follow the towpath south toward Slimbridge, passing the Splatt Swing Bridge on the way. Here you can take a short detour to visit the Slimbridge Wetland Centre where there's a large variety of wildlife to look out for. You can explore 120 acres on a series of good footpaths and boardwalks which pass over the lakes. The reserve boasts the largest collection of amphibians in the UK and the splendid Flamingo lagoon with the UK\u2019s largest flock of flamingos. The route continues round to Purton where you can visit the Purton Hulks. These abandoned boats and ships lie on the banks of the River Severn, just to the south of the village. You can extend your walk by continuing to the port of Sharpness where you can follow the Severn Way towards Berkeley where you'll find a fascinating 12th century castle and the Edward Jenner Museum.",
