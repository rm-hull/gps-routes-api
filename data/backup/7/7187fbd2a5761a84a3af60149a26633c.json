  "description": "These woods near Trentham have three nice waymarked trails to try. The walks are colour coded and include the Green Walk, Red Walk and Blue Walk. The route below takes you around all three routes in a 10 mile, figure of eight walk. There's some moderate climbs and great views over the area from the high points. You can pick up all the trails from the car park off Drayton Road, about a mile west of the village of Hanchurch. The woods are also great for mountain biking with some decent off road trails. The red section of the route climbs through Harley Thorns woods with fantastic views over Cannock Chase AONB to The Wrekin hill in Shropshire. The green section heads towards the village of Hanchurch, passing the pretty Hanchurch Pools on the way. The series of ponds lead to the village where you will find a Model Farm, Hanchurch Manor and a 17th century farmhouse and medieval schoolhouse. You'll also pass through the edge of Swynnerton Old Park and Hanchurch Heath. The long Blue Walk takes you south towards the village of Swynnerton, passing local caves and climbing to a high point of over 700ft. From here there are splendid views all the way to the Welsh Hills. Swynnerton is a very pretty village and nice place to stop for refreshments before continuing your walk. From the village you head north through farmland towards Beech, before returning to the car park. To extend your walking in the area then look no further than the lovely Trentham Gardens . Here you will find 300 acres of landscaped parkland, gardens and woodland with a fabulous lake. The long distance Two Saints Way also passes the woods. You could pick up the trail and follow it to the Trent and Mersey Canal . This route is designed for walkers but the woods are also popular with mountain bikers. There's 6 miles of mountain\u00a0bike\u00a0singletrack and other shorter tracks to try.",
