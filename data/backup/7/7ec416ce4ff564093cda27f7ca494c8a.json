  "description": "This walk visits Ladock Woods, in the Cornish village of Ladock, near Truro . You can start the walk from the parking area on the western side of the woods, just to the north west of Ladock village. From here you can head east onto one of the many shady trails that criss cross the woods. It's a peaceful and serene place for a stroll with generally not many other visitors. After exploring the woods head a short distance south to visit Ladock village where you can enjoy views of the Tresillian River and enjoy a drink at the local pub.",
