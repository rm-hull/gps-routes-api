  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside and woodlands to the west of Bromsgrove in the West Midlands. The historic route is designed to explore the ancient hunting forests of the middle ages. It's associated with the rise of Chartist settlements, priories and visiting kings. The waymarked walk starts on the western side of Bromsgrove and heads west to Dodford and Woodcote Green. You'll then pass through the Chaddesley Wood Nature Reserve  in the Wyre Forest District of the county. The attractive coniferous woodland is covered in pretty bluebells in the spring. There's also streams, ponds and a variety of wildflowers\u00a0in the summer. Look out for wildlife including woodcock, chiffchaff, crossbill\u00a0and blackcap as you make your way through this section of the walk. The route then turns east towards Bournheath and Catshill before turning south to return to Bromsgrove.",
