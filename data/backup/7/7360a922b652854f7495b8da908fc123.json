  "description": "This circular walk visits a splendid viewpoint near the village of Finzean in Aberdeenshire. You can start the walk from the parking area in the village and head west to the old church. Here you will pass along some peaceful woodland trails before looping round to climb Tom's Cairn. From the 310 metre high hill there are some excellent views over the surrounding countryside, hills and forestry. The hill is located just west of Banchory where you can enjoy a pleasant riverside walk along the River Dee and watch the leaping salmon at the Falls of Feugh .",
