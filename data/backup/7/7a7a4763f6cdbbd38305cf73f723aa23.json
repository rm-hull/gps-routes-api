  "description": "This pleasant market town in Shropshire has a couple of waymarked trails passing through it. You can use these waymarked paths to explore some attractive Shropshire countryside or enjoy waterside paths along the Roden River which runs through the town. This circular walk from the town uses sections of the Shropshire Way to visit the historic Moreton Corbet Castle and the nearby viewpoint at Grinshill. The walk starts at the train station where you can pick up the Shropshire Way and follow the waymarked footpath south east to Lee Brockhurst and the Lee Hills. Here you'll find a pleasant area of mixed woodland owned by the National Trust. The route continues south to Papermill Bank, Stanton Upon Hine Heath and Moreton Corbet. Here you'll find the atmospheric ruins of a 16th century house and 12th century medieval gatehouse. The route then heads west to Acton Reynald and Grinshill. The village is a nice place for a walk with a viewpoint on Grinshill and woodland trails through the adjacent Corbet Wood. The route then heads north through the countryside to Oaklands before crossing the River Roden and returning to Wem.",
