  "description": "This attractive small town is located near Colchester in Essex. There's some nice local parks, riverside trails and pockets of woodland to explore around the town. It's a historic place too with almost 300 listed buildings and a formerly extensive antique trade. Coggeshall won the Essex Best Kept Village award in its category in 1998 and 2001\u201303 and was named the Eastern England & Home Counties Village of the Year in 2003. This route uses a section of the Essex Way and other public footpaths to create a circular walk around the town. On the way there's nice views of the River Blackwater and some peaceful woodland trails to enjoy. You'll also visit two historic National Trust properties which attract many visitors each year. The walk starts in the centre of the town and heads east to link up with the Essex Way. You then head south towards Monk House where you cross the river and head west towards Grange Barn. This National Trust site includes a 13th-century monastic barn which is one of the oldest surviving timber structures in Europe.  It was constructed using English oak and formed part of the Cistercian complex of Coggeshall Abbey. Just a 5 minute walk away is Paycockes House a fine Tudor merchant's house built in 1500. You can find out about the history of the house and enjoy a stroll around the pretty gardens. Continue south west through the countryside for about half a mile before turning north east to cross the river again at Horseshoe Hole where there are some woodland trails. The route then heads east to return you to the town centre.",
