  "description": "This walk climbs to Hope Bowdler Hill from the Shropshire village of the same name. It's a moderate climb, running for about 1.5 miles along a decent footpath. The route starts in Hope Bowdler village and follows a footpath north west towards Black Planting and the Gaer Stone. You then continue north east to the 426 metre summit of Hope Bowdler Hill. From here there's excellent views to the surrounding Shropshire hills including the nearby Clee Hills and the Long Mynd. The route descends on the same paths though you could turn it into a longer circular walk by heading to Willstone Hill and then descending on Hope Batch. The Caer Caradoc circular walk passes close to the hill as well. It will take you up to the higher summit of this popular hill.",

The circular waymarked trail explores the valley of the River Corve, visiting a series of historic sites on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Hills Walks page."
