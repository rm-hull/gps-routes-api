  "description": "This fine park in Redbridge has a lovely walking trail taking you around the Heron pond, Perch Pond and along the delightful Ornamental canal. The 140 acre park also includes an 18th century temple which serves as a visitor centre with a wealth of information on the history of the area. You can start your walk from the car park on Warren Road. From here you can pick up the 3.25 mile the Chestnut Trail around the ponds, bluebell woods and canal. The River Roding passes the eastern edge of the park so you can pick up the waterside trail to extend your walk. The Epping Forest Centenary Walk passes the park's western edge at Bush Wood. You could pick up the trail and follow it south to Wanstead Flats. The flats are another nice place for walking with a large area of open grassland with ponds and interesting flora and fauna.",
