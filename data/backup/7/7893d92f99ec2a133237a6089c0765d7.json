In recent years dry autumns and summers have left it below capacity and requiring a link with nearby Bewl Water to top it up. However, it is currently operating at 88% capacity. Old Woman's Wood is on the opposite bank whilst a dumped jeep is just about keeping its bonnet above water."

  "description": "Explore Darwell Reservoir and Darwell Wood on this walk near Mountfield in East Sussex. The woods have lots of nice walking trails with streams, broadleaf woodland, bluebells and wild garlic to enjoy. From the public footpaths there are nice views through the trees to Darwell Reservoir. Look out for wildlife including green woodpeckers, buzzard, nightjar and sparrowhawk. The walk starts from the village of Mountfield just to the east of the woods. From here you can pick up public footpaths leading into the woods and towards the reservoir. Darwell Reservoir is located close to Robertsbridge and Battle.",
