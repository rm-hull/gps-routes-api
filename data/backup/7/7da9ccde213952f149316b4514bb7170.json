It has been restored to working order and is open to the public on some weekends. In 1990 it won a conservation award for Wind and Watermills. The mill is driven by a large breastshot waterwheel and is used to produce wholemeal and white flour, semolina and bran."

  "description": "This large village in Warwickshire has some nice riverside trails and a significant National Trust property to visit. There's also a noteworthy ancient pub to investigate after your exercise. The inn has a fascinating history stretching back hundreds of years. This walk from the village first heads south along the River Dene to visit the historic watermill before heading north to visit the splendid Charlecote Park . The Watermill dates back to the early part of the 19th century and sits in a picturesque riverside spot just a mile south of the settlement. The National Trust owned Charlecote includes a splendid deer park and pleasant woodland trails. You could extend the walk at the start by continuing south east to Combrook where you could visit the lovely Compton Verney . Here you'll find Capability Brown landscaped grounds surrounding a fine Georgian Mansion. For more detail about the history, architecture and the village's local airfield see the informative wikipedia page.",
