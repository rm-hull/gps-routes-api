  "description": "This large area of woodland near Challock has miles of good walking trails to try. There's a good sized sculpture trail with a series of interesting wooden sculptures and pretty bluebells in the springtime. The ancient woodland is comprised of Sweet Chestnut, Beech, Corsican Pine and Douglas Fir. It's a great place for wildlife with species including fallow deer, adders, nightjars and green woodpeckers. The forest is located just to the east of Challock with a parking area on White Hill Road. It is not too far from Canterbury and Ashford. This route is designed for walkers to explore the sculptures but there are also lots of good cycling trails on the hard forest roads and mountain bike trails in the woods. The North Downs Way also passes through the eastern end of the woods so you can pick up this bridleway section too. If you followed it south you could pay a visit to the pretty Eastwell Park Lake where there are some nice views across the still waters of the scenic lake. There's also a ruined 14th century church and the splendid Eastwell Manor, a former royal residence.",
