  "description": "This tudor house in Lapworth has nice footpaths to follow through the grounds and surrounding countryside. The house has gone through a major restoration project and includes a fine collection of 16th-century textiles and furniture. It's surrounded by a lovely park with a lake, pretty gardens, fine topiary and woodland. There's also herbaceous borders, wildflower meadows and a beautiful orchard. This circular walk from Packwood House explores the park before following country lanes and public footpaths through the countryside. The route also visits the 13th century St Giles' Church. To extend your walking in the area you can head to the nearby Baddesley Clinton. It's located just over a mile to the east of the house and well worth a visit. The moated manor house includes bluebell woodland trails in Hay Wood, a lake and a walled garden with flower borders and fruit trees. Just to the east of Packwood you will also find the Grand Union Canal. You can pick up the towpath and head north towards Solihull. Our Lapworth Circular Canal Walk visits both Packwood and Baddesley Clinton with nice waterside stretches along the two canals. A few miles to the west you will find Earlswood Lakes. Here you will find good footpaths running along three reservoirs with lots of wildlife to look out for. The long distance Heart of England Way also passes near to the house and is another good way to explore the area.",
