  "description": "This walk in Wrexham County visits a lovely wooded valley with streams, caves and waterfalls. The walk starts from the village of Bwlchgwyn and heads north east to enter the forest. Here you can follow a series of woodland trails along the streams and pretty waterfalls of the area. It's great for flora and fauna with rhododendrons and various woodland birds to look out for on the way. The route will take you to the northern side of the woods where you can enjoy a climb to Pen-Llan-y-Gwr. From the 378 metre high summit there are some fine views to the surrounding hills. On a clear day you can see Moel Famau in the Clwydian Range from the elevated spot. You can extend the walk by heading west to visit the Nant-y-Ffrith Reservoir.",

To the south you can pick up the Clywedog Trail where there's more riverside trails and a visit to the picturesque Nant Mill and Bersham Waterfall."
