  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the village of Strathpeffer in Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands. The route visits some of the area highlights including Blackmuir Wood and the Cat's Back Ridge where you can enjoy some splendid views to the nearby Loch Ussie. You'll also enjoy a climb to Cnoc Mor where there are more fine views over the area. The walk starts in Strathpeffer and head south to Blackmuir Wood where there are some pleasant woodland trails, an Iron Age hill fort and the Touchstone Maze. The maze is a wonderful collection of over 80 ancient rocks, laid out as a labyrinth. From here you head east along the Cats Back Ridge (Knock Farril) where there are wonderful panoramic views from the elevated path. The route then picks up a country lane heading west past Loch Ussie and back to Blackmuir Wood where you can climb to Cnoc Mor. To continue your walking in the area head west to visit the wonderful Rogie Falls. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Strathpeffer.
