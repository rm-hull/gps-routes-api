  "description": "Climb to the 694 m (2,277 ft)  summit of Pen y ghent on this challenging circular walk in the Yorkshire Dales. Pen y ghent is probably the most famous and popular of the Yorkshire Three Peaks. The others are Ingleborough and Whernside. This route is the classic ascent from Horton in Ribblesdale via Brackenbottom Scar. It runs for just under 6 miles and includes a challenging ascent of over 1300ft. You start in the village of Horton in Ribblesdale at the car park and follow country lanes towards Brackenbottom. You continue the ascent, picking up the Pennine Way just before reaching the summit. From here there are fabulous views across the Yorkshire Dales. The descent follows the Pennine Way passing Tarn Barn, Horton Scar and Hull Point - the largest natural hole in England. The mountain is located close to the Malham Tarn Estate where you can enjoying cycling and walking trails around the beautiful glacial lake and try another challenging climb to Fountains Fell and Fountains Fell Tarn.",
