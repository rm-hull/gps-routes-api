  "description": "Climb to the 694 m (2,277 ft) summit of Pen y ghent on this challenging circular walk in the Yorkshire Dales. Pen y ghent is probably the most famous and popular of the Yorkshire Three Peaks. The others are Ingleborough and Whernside. This route is the classic ascent from Horton in Ribblesdale via Brackenbottom Scar. It runs for just under 6 miles and includes a challenging ascent of over 1300ft. You start in the village of Horton in Ribblesdale at the car park and follow country lanes towards Brackenbottom. You continue the ascent, picking up the Pennine Way just before reaching the summit. From here there are fabulous views across the Yorkshire Dales. The descent follows the Pennine Way passing Tarn Barn, Horton Scar and Hull Point - the largest natural hole in England. The mountain is located close to the Malham Tarn Estate where you can enjoying cycling and walking trails around the beautiful glacial lake and try another challenging climb to Fountains Fell and Fountains Fell Tarn.",

The friendly pub has a great menu, a good selection of beers and outdoor seating. Here you can sit next to the River Ribble and enjoy fine views towards the hills if the weather is fine. You can find it on Austwick Rd with a postcode of BD24 0EH for your sat navs."

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "For a shorter route you could try the Hull Pot Walk which visits the wonderful natural hole on the slopes of the mountain. Here you'll find England's largest naturally formed hole measuring 91 metres (300 feet) long by 18 metres (60 feet) wide by 18 metres (60 feet) deep. The waterfall that flows into it from the Hull Pot Beck is a spectacular sight after rainfall. It's located just off the Pennine Way about 1.6 miles north east of Horton. The waymarked Ribble Way passes through Horton. You could pick up the riverside trails and follow it south to Helwith Bridge and Stainforth where you can visit the lovely Stainforth Force Waterfall. The village of Horton is accessible by rail on the Settle\u2013Carlisle Line. There is about one train every two hours in each direction: southbound to Leeds (seven in total) and northbound to Carlisle (eight, plus one evening train that terminates at Ribblehead)."
