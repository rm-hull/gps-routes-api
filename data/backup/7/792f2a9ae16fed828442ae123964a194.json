  "description": "The town of Littleborough has a lot of great options for walkers visiting the region. It is nicely located in the upper Roch Valley by the foothills of the South Pennines. There's several waymarked trails, hill climbs, reservoirs and a canal running through the area. This circular walk visits several of the highlights of the area using a some of the waymarked trails that circle the town. The walk starts at the train station which lies on the Caldervale Line 13\u00be miles (22 km) north of Manchester Victoria towards Halifax, Bradford Interchange and Leeds. From here you can pick up the Station Walk and follow it south to visit Hollingworth Lake . The lake is a popular local attraction with a waterside trail and lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. The route then picks up a section of the Pennine Bridleway , following it east towards Longdon Clough. The route then follows a different bridleway up to Windy Hill and Rook Stone Hill, where you pick up the Pennine Way National Trail. This will take you north to another highlight of the area at Blackstone Edge . This geologically significant gritstone escarpment commands wonderful views over Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The path will take you north along the Edge to Blackstone Edge Reservoir where there's some more nice waterside trails. At the resevoir you continue west and then north around the Chelham Reservoirs before picking up the Rochdale Canal . You can then follow the towpath south back to the train station.",
