  "description": "Enjoy miles of mountain bike trails and walking trails in these woods near Cheddar. You can start from the village of Rowberrow, just north of Shipham. Just head east from the village and you can pick up the bridleways and tracks through the woods. It's an attractive area with shady clearings, streams and interesting flora and fauna to look out for. The woods are crossed by two long distance footpaths. In the northern end of the woods you can pick up the Limestone Link and follow it to Dolebury Warren and Burrington Combe , where there are more good mtb trails. The climb to Beacon Batch on Black Down hill starts from the car park here. The hill is the highest point in the Mendip Hills and provides great views over the lovely Blagdon Lake . The West Mendip Way also passes along the southern end of the site. You can pick this up to head to Shipham. See the video below for an example of the mtb trails you'll find in the woods.",
