  "description": "This 3 mile circular walk takes you around the lovely Penhurst Estate near Tonbridge in Kent. Although there is an admission charge to access the house and gardens you can follow public footpaths through the wider estate's parkland and woodland. There's much to enjoy with fine views of the medieval manor house and the River Medway. There's also several pretty lakes and nice woodland trails in the north eastern section of the park. The 14th century house has a fascinating history, having been the birthplace of the great Elizabethan poet, courtier and soldier, Sir Philip Sidney who was a favourite of Elizabeth I. You can explore the house and see fine furniture and portraits. The house is also surrounded by wonderful Grade I listed Gardens with an Arboretum, Trout Lakes, Lake Park and Lancup Well. The Eden Valley Walk long distance trail runs through the park with this route using a section of the path. You could extend your walk by continuing east along the path and visiting Haysden Country Park just outside Tonbridge. There's nice views of the River Medway and two pretty lakes to enjoy. The trail continues into Tonbridge itself where you can pick up the Wealdway. If you would like to visit by bike then try the Tonbridge to Penshurst Cycle Route. The lovely traffic free path starts from Tonbridge Castle and follows Regional Route 12 to the site, passing the lovely Haysden Lakes on the way.",

Just to the south there's the village of Speldhurst where you'll find an ancient pub dating back 1212."
