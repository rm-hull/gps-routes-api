  "description": "Explore the pine woodlands and open heath of Blidworth Woods, on this peaceful walk in Sherwood Forest. You can park in the Blidworth Lane car park at the northern end of the woods to start the walk. There is also a larger parking area on Longdale Lane at the southern end. From here you can pick up a number of walking trails including the Robin Hood Way long distance footpath, which runs through the centre of the woods. The trail runs through the nearby village of Blidworth so you could start the walk from there and follow the trail to the site if you prefer. If you follow the trail west you could visit the nearby Harlow Wood, just to the south of Mansfield. Near here you will also find Kings Mill Reservoir which has a nice trail to follow around the water. Just to the south you will find Burntstump Country Park where there's more nice trails and an ornamental pond.",
