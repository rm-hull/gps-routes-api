  "description": "This walk takes you from the Staffordshire village of Astonefield to Dovedale in the Peak District. The walk starts from the popular George Inn Pub on Church Lane in the village centre. The noteworthy inn dates from the 18th century and is situated in a lovely spot on the village green. It's very walker friendly and has a nice outdoor seating area to relax in. From the pub you can follow Church Lane and Millway Lane south east to a footpath which will take you to nearby Milldale. The little hamlet has some pretty stone cottages and is situated next to the River Dove. Here you can pick up footpaths heading south along the river through the beautiful Dovedale. On the path there's attractive woodland, interesting vegetation and interesting geological rock formations. The path leads to the Dovedale Stepping Stone which is a hugely popular beauty spot. The stones were first set down in the 19th century for Victorian tourists to cross the river. After taking in the lovely views of the surrounding Peak District Hills here you retrace your steps on the same paths back to Alstonefield. Here you can enjoy some well earned refreshments at The George in the beer garden overlooking the village green. To continue your walking from the village you could head north and visit Wolfscote Dale and the Beresford Dale Nature Reserve where there's riverside paths, weirs, woodland, wildflowers and birdlife to enjoy.",
