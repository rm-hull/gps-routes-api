The Beer Walk involves walking around the villages of Saddleworth taking in the wonderful local scenery (and a certain amount of local refreshment.) This is traditionally done in Fancy Dress.

Luckily the existing structure was in a good enough condition to be restored and used, saving a lot of construction time."

  "description": "The pretty village of Uppermill is in a lovely location on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the River Tame. It's also located close to the South Pennines and the Peak District making it an excellent base for walking. This circular walk around the village follows a section of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal before heading to the nearby Dovestone Reservoir on the waymarked Oldham Way. There's much to enjoy with easy waterside paths and some more challenging climbs with the reward of excellent views over the surrounding moors. The walk starts on the canal in Uppermill and follows the towpath south to Grasscroft with views of the River Tame on the way. Here you leave the canal and follow the Oldham Way and other paths east to visit the popular Dovestone Reservoir. You can follow the Oldham Way north along the eastern part of the reservoir before passing Aldermans Hill and heading across Brockley Moor. You then turn north along the western edge of Saddleworth Moor to Rocher Brow. Here you turn west to rejoin the canal at Uppermill.",
