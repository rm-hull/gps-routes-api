  "description": "The delightful little village of Austwick is positioned nicely in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. This circular walk from the village visits the fascinating Norber Erratics before heading to the nearby village of Clapham. The walk runs for just over 4 miles with a moderate climb on the way. The walk starts in the village and follows a footpath north past Austwick Hall and Town head before climbing up to Norber Erratics. Here you'll find a set of glacial erratic boulders which were probably deposited by melting ice sheets at the end of the last ice age, around 12,000 years ago. The area includes some wonderful limestone scenery and fine views over the dales countryside. You then descend to the south west to pick up Thwaite Lane and follow it west into Clapham. The popular village has been home to the Farrer family who established their Ingleborough estate in the 18th century. The family owns, and is responsible for, much of the land, walls, woods, fields and moors of the village, surrounding countryside and farms. After exploring the village you can pick up another public footpath and follow it east back into Austwick.",

The historic mullioned farmhouse was built in 1640 and has since been renovated to house the Clapham Bunkhouse (Group Accommodation) and The Reading Room Cafe/Bar licensed to sell hot food, alcohol, arts, crafts and gifts. It's got a great menu and sells some fine real ales. You can find it on Church Avenue at postcode LA2 8EQ.The New Inn is another good option, set in an 18th-century coaching inn overlooking the Clapham Beck (Postcode:LA2 8HH). There's also the Game Cock back in Austwick which is a traditional Dales pub on the village green, serving good British food with a French/Mediterranean twist (postcode: LA2 8BB)."

It's a lovely hidden gem of a place with fine limestone scenery and a delightful local tea room with a falconry. The circular Feizor Walk starts from the hamlet and visits Austwick before heading to the picturesque Stainforth Force Waterfalls on the River Ribble.
