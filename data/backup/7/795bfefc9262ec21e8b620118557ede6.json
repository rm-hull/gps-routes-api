  "description": "This walk takes you around the lovely Fernworthy Reservoir and into Fernworthy Forest in Dartmoor. There's a nice waterside path to take you around the reservoir with the option of extending your walk into the adjacent Fernworthy Forest, where you will find miles of delightful woodland trails. It's a really pretty area with a variety of birdlife to look out for on the tranquil waters of the reservoir. You may also see some Dartmoor ponies cooling off in the summer! The area has good facilities with toilets, a catering van and parking on the south side of the reservoir. This walk starts at the car park and takes you along the reservoir and into Fernworthy Forest. You'll also visit the Fernworthy Stone Circle where you will find a Bronze Age circle of 27 granite slabs standing in a clearing on a plateau of land. There are splendid views of Thornworthy Tor and the South Teign River at the eastern end of the reservoir. If you'd like to continue your walk then you could pick up the Two Moors Way which runs through the area. You could follow it south to visit the fascinating Bronze Age settlement at Grimspound. The reservoir is located near Chagford .",
