  "description": "Travel through the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park on this circular walk around the pretty village of Barningham in County Durham. The walk passes through the stunning Arkengarthdale - the northernmost of the Yorkshire Dales where there are stunning views of the Pennine Hills to enjoy. Scenery on the walk includes waterfalls, moors, becks and forests while there is also a visit to the village of Langthwaite which was used for the filming of several scenes in the television series All Creatures Great and Small. This is a very challenging walk with some steep climbs, but with the reward of some simply stunning views over this beautiful area.",
