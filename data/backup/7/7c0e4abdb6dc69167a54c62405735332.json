People were evacuated from Catcliffe and the M1 was closed for a period. Water was pumped out and fortunately the dam held; work is now taking place to strengthen the structure. Note that despite the wet summer, water levels are low."

  "description": "Enjoy a short walk or cycle around the beautiful Ulley Reservoir near Rotherham. There are lovely paved paths around the reservoir and fanatastic views of the surrounding Yorkshire countryside. It's also great for birdwatching with a number of water loving birds to see on the water. You can start your exercise from the car park on the north western side of the site. National Cycle Route 6 runs past the park so you could continue your ride along the Rotherham to Worksop cycle route. If you're on foot then head north to Guilthwaite and you could pick up the Rotherham Round Walk. The waymarked trail explores the area around the town. If you follow it north west there's a nice section along the River Rother into the town centre.",

The country pub does good quality home cooked food with a decent selection of ales. It has some history too with parts dating from the 1600s. You can find them at 64 Main St with a postcode of S26 3XJ for your sat navs."

The splendid Wentworth Woodhouse is another good option in the Rotherham area. The Grade I listed house is surrounded by some lovely parkland walks. Head south and there's more pleasant waterside walking around Harthill Reservoir and Pebley Reservoir near Barlborough. A few miles to the north there's a lovely lakeside trail and lots of wildlife to see in the popular Thrybergh Country Park. The peaceful woodland trails in Wickersley Woods are also located near here."
