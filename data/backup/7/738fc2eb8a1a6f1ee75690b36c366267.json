Sheepwash Ghyll has cut a deep ravine running over a base of sandstone often forming small 'waterfalls' as here and providing a ford for the footpath going up Scragged Oak Hill (to the right). Sheepwash Ghyll flows out of Whitevane Pond, about 1.5km to the north of this photo, through Roosthole Pond and as Goldings stream into (Birchen) Mill Pond. Flowing out of (Birchen) Mill Pond and under the A281 it emerges as the river Arun on its way to the sea at Littlehampton."

  "description": "This large area of woodland is located just to the east of Horsham. There are miles of cycling and walking trails to explore with attractive pine woodland, a series of pretty streams with little waterfalls and the Whitevane Pond at the north western end of the forest. There are good wide tracks ideal for a mountain bike or hybrid. There's some steep climbs to try with fun descents. For walkers there are miles of easy flat tracks to enjoy. Look out for wildlife including peacocks and wood warblers. The forest can be easily reached by following the High Weald Landscape Trail from the centre of Horsham. You could extend your walking along the trail by heading through the countryside to Slaugham and Warninglid.",
