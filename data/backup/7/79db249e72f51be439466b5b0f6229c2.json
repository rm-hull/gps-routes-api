  "description": "This walk runs from Wimpole Hall to Gamlingay via the abandoned medieval village of Clopton. The path runs along a prominent ridge giving wonderful views of the surrounding countryside of Cambridgeshire. The walk start point at Wimpole Hall is particularly appealing. This 17th century country house has 3,000 acres (12 km\u00b2) of parkland and farmland and is owned by the National Trust. The route then proceeds to Croydon, Tadlow and Cockayne Hatley before a section through Potton Wood takes you to Gamlingay.",

The wildlife rich reserve includes pretty lakes, wildflower meadows and wetland areas. On the walk you can also visit the ancient Bourn Windmill, the oldest surviving windmill in the United Kingdom."
