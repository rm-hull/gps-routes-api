  "description": "A lovely walk from Lewes to Alfriston , first following the River Ouse before picking up the South Downs Way. It's a varied walk running for about 11 miles with flat riverside paths preceding some moderate climbs into the surrounding hills. From the high points there are tremendous views towards the south coast. The walk starts on the river at Cliffe, just to the east of the train station and the castle. From here you can pick up the Sussex Ouse Valley Way and follow it south past the Lewes Railway Nature Reserve to Southease . Here you pick up the South Downs Way and follow it east to Beddingham Hill and Firle Beacon . The beacon is one of the highlights of the area with wonderful views over the Weald towards the south coast. The Firle Escarpment\u00a0is also a\u00a0Site of Special Scientific Interest. The large area of chalkland is home to a variety of flora and fauna. Look out for the rare spider orchid Ophrys sphegodes and Exmoor Ponies as you make your way through this lovely area. After taking in the views the route descends to Bostal Hill before coming into Alfriston. The village is a great place for extending your exercise. You can enjoy a lovely waterside walk to Cuckmere River and Cuckmere Haven or head to the popular Seven Sisters Country Park . You can extend the walk by heading all the way to the coast at Eastbourne on our Lewes to Eastbourne Walk .",
