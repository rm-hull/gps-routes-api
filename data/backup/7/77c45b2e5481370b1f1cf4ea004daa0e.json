  "description": "This attractive village makes a fine base for exploring the Yorkshire Dales\u00a0National Park. There's some fine river paths, a number of waterfalls and a National Trail running through the area. This circular walk from the village visits a series of pretty waterfalls and includes a stretch along the Pennine Way National Trail which runs through the area. The route visits Kisdon Force , East Gill and Catrake Force before an optional extension to Wain Wath Force which lies just to the north west of the settlement. Alon the way there's also nice riverside paths along the Swale and a visit to the neighbouring village of Muker. The return leg runs along an elevated section of the Pennine Way with fine views to enjoy from the high points.",
