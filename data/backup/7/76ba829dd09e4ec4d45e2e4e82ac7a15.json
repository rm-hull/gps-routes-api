  "description": "A long distance cycling and walking trail running from Alice Holt Forest to Portsmouth along the imagined route a tree may have taken from forest to warship. The varied trail includes woodland sections, country parks and coastal paths. On the way you'll pass Bordon , Liphook , Liss , Petersfield, Queen Elizabeth Country Park , Staunton Country Park , Langstone Harbour , Havant and Hayling Island . There's splendid views of the South Downs and lovely views over to the Isle of Wight on the final coastal section. A lot of the route takes place on nice off road trails but there are some on road sections which are less suitable for walkers. The route starts from Bentley Rail Station on the edge of Alice Holt Forest. You then head south, following the woodland trails through the forest. You continue south past Broxhead Common to Bordon, where you skirt the edge of Woolmer Forest . The expansive site includes oak-birch woodland, conifer plantations, open sandy heaths, and rough grazed pastures. The route continues through Liss and Petersfield before coming to the splendid Queen Elizabeth Country Park. The large park is one of the highlights of the trail with 2000 acres of open access woodland and downland. There's also great views over the South Downs as you make your way through this area. The next stage runs from the park to Havant passing Rowland's Castle and Staunton Country Park. The 1000 acre park includes a farm, two lakes, a maze, a walled garden and glasshouses containing exotic tropical flowers and plants from around the world. You continue south through Havant to Hayling Island where you pick up the Hayling Billy Trail to take you along the western side of the island. The trail provides great views of Langstone Harbour which is an internationally important site for its wildfowl and wading birds. The final section takes you over the ferry to Portsea Island where you run along the coast through Southsea to the finish point at Portsmouth Docks. There's some fine views over Portsmouth Harbour and the option of catching the ferry over to Gosport .",
