  "description": "This beautiful sculpture park in Dorchester is one of the major highlights of the region. There are 26 acres to explore on good footpaths, taking you around and between the pretty Pallington Lakes. The lakes are surrounded by lovely meadows and there is a stunning, beautifully designed garden too. It's a great place for an easy afternoon stroll with several fine sculptures by Simon Gudgeon to see. You can easily extend your walk by heading to the nearby Pallington Heath where there are miles of woodland walking trails. The Jubilee Trail also runs past the lakes so you could pick this up to extend your outing.",
