  "description": "This seaside resort is located in a great spot on the North Wales coast in Denbighshire. For walkers there's fine coastal trails and wonderful hill climbs inland to try. Three epic long distance trails start/end in the town, providing an opportunity to explore the surrounding area on good waymarked footpaths. There's also lovely beaches and the Gronant Dunes which is the last major (surviving) example of the former large dune system that covered the coast of North East Wales. The rare sand lizard and the natterjack toad can be spotted in this wildlife rich area. This route uses sections of the Dyserth to Prestatyn Walkway, the North Wales Path and the Offa's Dyke Path to create a circular walk around the town. It visits some of nearby highlights including the viewpoint at Graig Fawr and the neighbouring village of Dyserth. You can start the walk on the sea front at the Nova West car park. The train station is also on the route so if you're coming by public transport it's easy to pick it up. From the sea front head south along the North Wales Path and it will take you through the town before heading up to the Prestatyn Hillside Nature Reserve on the Offa's Dyke Path. Continue south west along the waymarked trail and it will take you up to Graig Fawr where there are some lovely views towards the coast. The route then descends to the south to visit Dyserth. Here you can try the Dyserth Waterfall Walk and visit the 70ft falls. There's also caves, woodland trails, a 16th century church and some nice tea rooms to see in this area. After exploring the village you head north picking up the Dyserth to Prestatyn Walkway which runs along a disused railway line. This will take you past Meliden and the golf course before descending back in to the town.",
