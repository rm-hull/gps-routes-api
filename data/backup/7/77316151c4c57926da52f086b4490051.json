  "description": "This seaside resort is located in a great spot on the North Wales coast in Denbighshire. For walkers there's fine coastal trails and wonderful hill climbs inland to try. Three epic long distance trails start/end in the town, providing an opportunity to explore the surrounding area on good waymarked footpaths. There's also lovely beaches and the Gronant Dunes which is the last major (surviving) example of the former large dune system that covered the coast of North East Wales. The rare sand lizard and the natterjack toad can be spotted in this wildlife rich area. This route uses sections of the Dyserth to Prestatyn Walkway, the North Wales Path and the Offa's Dyke Path to create a circular walk around the town. It visits some of nearby highlights including the viewpoint at Graig Fawr and the neighbouring village of Dyserth. You can start the walk on the sea front at the Nova West car park. The train station is also on the route so if you're coming by public transport it's easy to pick it up. From the sea front head south along the North Wales Path and it will take you through the town before heading up to the Prestatyn Hillside Nature Reserve on the Offa's Dyke Path. Continue south west along the waymarked trail and it will take you up to Graig Fawr where there are some lovely views towards the coast. The route then descends to the south to visit Dyserth. Here you can try the Dyserth Waterfall Walk and visit the 70ft falls. There's also caves, woodland trails, a 16th century church and some nice tea rooms to see in this area. After exploring the village you head north picking up the Dyserth to Prestatyn Walkway which runs along a disused railway line. This will take you past Meliden and the golf course before descending back in to the town.",

      "content": "Head east along the coast path and you could visit the Point of Ayr Nature Reserve. There's wonderful views across the Dee Estuary and lots of wildlife to look out for here. If you continue south east the path will take you to Holywell and the historic Flint Castle. If you follow the Wales Coast Path west from the town you can visit Rhyl, Kinmel Bay and Abergele. Here you could visit the woodland, gardens and viewpoint at Gwrych Castle. The Grade I listed castle became famous in 2020 when it was used as the setting for the 20th series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! On the western side of the castle there's the small village of Rhyd y Foel where you can enjoy a climb to the Pen y Corddyn Mawr hill fort. There's photogenic limestone scenery and more fine views over the River Dulas valley from this interesting ancient site. The western end of the Clwydian Way also starts in the town."
