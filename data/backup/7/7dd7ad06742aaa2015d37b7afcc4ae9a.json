  "description": "This Gloucestershire village is located on the Thames Path National Trail very close to the Source of the River Thames . The village includes two fine 19th century pubs, an historic 13th century church and Kemble Railway station which is on the main line from London Paddington. This walk from the village takes you to the river source where you will find a monument with an inscription to mark the source of the river. You can then pick up the Monarch's Way to visit the splendid Cirencester Park . The expansive park is one of the walking highlights of the area with miles of trails to follow around woodland, parkland and lakes. In the town you can also visit the historic Cirencester Abbey before returning on the same paths. The village is also ideally positioned for visiting the Cotswold Water Park . Simply follow the Thames Path south and it will take you to the park where there are miles of walking trails around numerous lakes including the nearby Neigh Bridge Country Park .",
