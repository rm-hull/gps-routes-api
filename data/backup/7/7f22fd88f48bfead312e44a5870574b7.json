      "caption": "Old Dunlewy Church with lough beyond. The story of Dunlewey Church is indeed a touching one, tied to the deep love between James Russell and his wife, Jane. After marrying Jane Smith in 1825, James Russell amassed a fortune as a hop merchant in London. With their wealth, the couple purchased the Dunlewey estate in County Donegal, an area known for its stunning natural beauty, nestled between the wild Atlantic Ocean and the Derryveagh Mountains. Tragically, Jane passed away in 1843, and James was heartbroken. As a lasting tribute to his beloved wife, James commissioned the construction of a beautiful church on the estate. This church, known as the Dunlewey Church of Ireland, was completed in 1853. The building, made of locally sourced white marble and blue limestone, stands as a symbol of James's enduring love for Jane. The church, with its Gothic architecture, has become a landmark in the area, attracting visitors who come not only to admire its beauty but also to reflect on the touching story behind its creation. Although it is no longer in use as a place of worship, the church remains a poignant reminder of the great love between James and Jane Russell."

According to legend, this striking landscape was the site where the giant king Balor of Tory Island met his end. Balor, who had a deadly, poisonous eye, was slain by his grandson Lughaidh. As the story goes, the poison from Balor's eye spilled out, splitting the rocks and poisoning the glen, hence the name. However, the true origin of the name is less dramatic. The glen was originally intended to be called \"An Gleann Neamhe,\" meaning \"The Heavenly Glen.\" But when an English cartographer mapped the area, he made a mistake, writing it as \"An Gleann Neimhe,\" which translates to \"The Poisoned Glen.\" This cartographic error resulted in the eerie and ominous name the glen carries today."

It originates in the Derryveagh Mountains, specifically from the southern end of the Poisoned Glen (Cr\u00f3 Nimhe in Irish), a glacial valley steeped in local mythology. The burn flows northwest through the middle of the Poisoned Glen, passing along the southern edge of the village of Dunlewey (D\u00fan L\u00faiche in Irish), which lies at the base of Errigal (An Earagail), the highest peak in County Donegal. As it continues its course, the Cronaniv Burn eventually merges with the Devlin River (Abhainn Dhuibhlinne), just before the Devlin River enters Dunlewey Lough (Loch Dh\u00fan L\u00faiche). The burn's journey from the mountains to the lough is relatively short, but it plays a vital role in the hydrology of the area, contributing to the scenic beauty and natural ecosystem of the Poisoned Glen and its surroundings."
