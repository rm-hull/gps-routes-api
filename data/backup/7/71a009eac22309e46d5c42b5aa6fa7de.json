  "description": "This circular walk takes you along a section of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in Crowle, Lincolnshire. There's nice waterside grassy paths and good views of the surrounding countryside on this easy walk. The walk starts from Crowle train station which is located next to the canal at Crowle Wharf. From here you follow the canal west to Goodnow Bridge where there's a level crossing. Cross the canal here and you can pick up country lanes to take you into Crowle. Bridle tracks and quiet lanes head east and then south to take you to Ealand before returning to the station.",
