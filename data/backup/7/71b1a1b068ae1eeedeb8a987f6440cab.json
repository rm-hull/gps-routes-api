  "description": "This walk explores a delightful woodland nature reserve in Hendre, near the market town of Mold in Flintshire. There's a nice woodland trail here taking you through the site which includes ancient oak and ash woodland, grassland areas, a wildflower meadow in the summer. Also of interest are the carpets of bluebells in spring and a variety of woodland birds to watch out for. It's a little bit of a hidden gem with and a nice place for an easy peaceful stroll.",
