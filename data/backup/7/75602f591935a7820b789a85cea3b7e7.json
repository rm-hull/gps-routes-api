  "description": "Enjoy a stroll along this large reservoir on the Isle of Anglesey. The lake cover 770 acres and has a number of walking trails along the water. There are also wildflowers, butterflies and bird hides where you can look out for the wide variety of birds that visit the lake. Just to the south you can visit Llyn Llywenan for more nice views and trails. A couple of miles to the west is Llanddeusant where you can explore the fascinating Llynon\u00a0Mill. The 18th century mill is notable as the only working windmill in Wales. The site also includes two Iron Age roundhouses where you can learn all about the ancient history of the area.",
