  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this lovely loch in the Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park. The route runs for a distance of about 5.5 miles with fine views across the water to the surrounding hills and countryside. Start the walk from the Greenock Cut Visitor Centre and car park on the eastern side of the water. The centre provides lots of useful information on all the walks in the area. It's also located very close to the lovely Greenock Cut Waterfall pictured below. From the car park head north to Loch Thom cottage and then east. On the eastern side of the water there is some nice woodland and the adjacent Gryfe Reservoir. Country lanes then take you around the southern side of the water before returning to the car park. To continue your walking in the area try the Greenock Cut circular walk which branches off to the west from the visitor centre. The Kelly Cut Walk can also be picked up here. If you head west from the loch you can visit the coastal section of the park. Here there are fine views of the South Clyde estuary and Lunderston Bay.",
