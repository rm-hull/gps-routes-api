  "description": "This village in Cheshire is a great place to start a walk. There's a car park here giving access to the climb to The Cloud with more trails to link to afterwards. This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the area including the Bosley Cloud and the Macclesfield Canal. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Gritstone Trail and the Staffordshire Way and follow these waymarked footpaths north east to climb to the Cloud. You then head north to meet with the Macclesfield Canal. Here you can follow the towpath west towards Congleton before turning south towards Dane in Shaw. Here you leave the canal and turn north east to return to Timbersbrook.",
