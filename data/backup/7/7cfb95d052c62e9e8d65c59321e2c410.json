Saint Myllin, who is said to have performed baptisms here in the sixth century, is honoured by the well's dedication.  Saint Myllin is also honoured in the parish church. The Irish bishop Saint Mo Ling, also known as Moling Luachra, is said to be the patron saint of Myllin (614\u2013697). This is uncertain, though. There is no evidence that Mo Ling visited Wales, and it is said that Myllin is interred beneath the altar of the church in Llanfyllin while Mo Ling is thought to have been laid to rest at his monastery in Ireland."

  "description": "This market town is located in Montgomeryshire, Powys. Walkers can explore the beautiful River Cain Valley and the nearby Berwyn Mountains. Other local walking highlights include Lake Vyrnwy and the Snowdonia National Park to the west. To the north west there's the incredible views from Cadair Berwyn and the wonderful Pistyll Rhaeadr waterfall. The interesting old town also includes two 18th century pubs for post walk refreshment. This circular walk from the village visits the Llanfyllin Workhouse . The workhouse is located just east of the village and is a historical highlight of the area. Here you can learn all about the working conditions for those unfortunate to enter the 1830s workhouse. It has been well preserved with lots of information boards detailing the history of the area. On the walk you can also enjoy some splendid views of the rolling hills surrounding the town.",
