The concessionary path leading through Hoe Rough forms two loops - one runs along a stream and an adjoining meadow, the other traverses the somewhat higher ground to the east. Unimproved meadows such as these as Hoe Rough Nature Reserve are becoming increasingly rare. A number of old oak trees grow here, one of which is believed to be at least 330 years old. The rough is now continuously grazed by sheep and cattle but the crab apple trees probably originate from the time when pigs foraged here, the seeds having originated from swill fed to them. Hoe Rough Nature Reserve is managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust."

  "description": "This route takes you from Gressenhall to Lenwade, passing through the lovely River Wensum Valley in Norfolk. The trail links with the Nar Valley Way at the western end and with the Marriot's Way at the eastern end. The route runs for about 12 miles on fairly flat footpaths. There's much to enjoy with a series of picturesque villages, historic sites and some splendid Norfolk countryside. The walk starts in Gressenhall at the car park next to Hoe Rough nature reserve. The trail then heads south and then east to Swanton Morley, Elsing and Lyng where you will pass through the wildlife rich Sparham Pools Nature Reserve. This section of the walk is coincident with the Walsingham Way which runs from the historic abbey at Great Walsingham to the city of Norwich. You continue through Pockthorpe before coming to Lenwade where the trail finishes.",
