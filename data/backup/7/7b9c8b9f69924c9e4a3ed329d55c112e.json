  "description": "This quaint old fishing village sits in a lovely spot on the North Norfolk Coast. This walk from the village takes you to neighbouring Cromer before heading inland to visit the National Trust's Felbrigg Hall Park. The route uses sections of the Paston Way and the Weavers' Way, two waymarked long distance trails running through the area. The first section takes you to Cromer along a wonderful cliff top path with fabulous coastal views. At Cromer you turn south along the Weavers Way to visit Felbrigg where you'll find an historic old hall surrounded by some beautiful parkland and gardens.",
