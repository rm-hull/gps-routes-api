  "description": "This walk visits the ruins of Waverley Abbey in Farnham , Surrey. There's some nice walking trails along the River Wey and around the site which is run by English Heritage. As well as the atmospheric ruins there's also a pretty serpentine lake to stroll along and a number of information plaques detailing the history of the abbey. They will tell you how it was originally founded in 1128 as the first Cistercian Abbey in England. There's a car park near Waverley Bridge where you can pick up the trails to take you to the ruins. The Greensand Way passes the abbey so you can extend the walk by following it north to the Moor Park Nature Reserve. Here you can look out for lots of water loving wildlife on the river. If you follow the trail south it will take you toward Tilford and the popular Frensham Ponds .",
