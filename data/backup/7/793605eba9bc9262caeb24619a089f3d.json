  "description": "This attractive village in South Cambridgeshire is a pleasant place for an easy riverside stroll.

The walk starts in the village and heads east to join a bridleway on the eastern side of the settlement. You can follow this footpath east along the river to Hauxton. Here you turn north along the River Granta until you reach the pretty riverside mill. The village is located just a few miles south of the university city of Cambridge.
