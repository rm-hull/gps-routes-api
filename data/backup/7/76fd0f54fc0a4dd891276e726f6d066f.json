  "description": "This lovely nature reserve near Driffield is a splendid place for an easy waterside walk. There's also an abundance of wildlife to see with many species of water loving bird to look out for. In particular keep your eyes peeled for the Kingfisher and the attractive Bittern from one of the many viewing hides dotted around the sites. This circular walk starts from the visitor centre car park before heading north along the upper reservoir. You can then continue north along the River Hull New Cut before crossing to the other side on Bethell's Swing Bridge. The route continues to Emmotland and Coneygarth Hill before following a bridleway south to Hempholme Farm. You then head west to return to the River Hull, crossing at the Lock and the heading south to retrace your steps back to the car park.",
