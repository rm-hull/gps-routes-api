  "description": "Enjoy magnificent views of the North Downs in 170 acres of beautiful woodland and chalk downland at Trosley Country Park. There are three waymarked trails of varying difficulty and a trim trail for those looking to get super fit! The Woodland walk trail and the Trosley Trail are both open to cyclists. There's plenty of wildlife in the park - look out for green woodpeckers, tawny owls and sparrowhawks. The park also has an excellent cafe, picnic area and a play area. Trosley Country Park is located about 6 miles from Sevenoaks. See the video below from Kent Council for more information.",
