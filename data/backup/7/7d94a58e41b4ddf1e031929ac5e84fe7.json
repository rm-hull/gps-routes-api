      "caption": "During mediaeval times the village of Lydford on the north-western side of Dartmoor was one of the four most important settlements in Devon with its own Norman Fort, and Castle. Folk who lived and eked out a living in the centre of Dartmoor were therefore taken to Lydford for burial when they died, and the route across the moors from the Hexworthy area to Lydford was known as the Lych Way.  Snaking across very flat boggy moorland this is the bridleway looking back in the Hexworthy direction. Up until 1999 the bridleway followed a straight line route more or less due west from the Higher Cherrybrook Bridge car park, but it was diverted to its current course in that year.  The planted trees in the distance form part of the Bellever Forest."

  "description": "Follow in the footsteps of medieval church goers on this ancient path on Dartmoor Forest. The path was used by people travelling from their farms on the moor to the church in Lydford. It's also known as the 'Way of the Dead' as people would carry their dead to the graveyard for burials as well. The path runs for nearly 12 miles and climbs to a height of over 1500 feet so it is a challenging walk. You are rewarded with splendid views across Dartmoor for much of the way. You can start the walk from the car park at Bellever and then head west across Bellever Forest. The path leaves the woods and then climbs to Longaford Tor passing the eery Wistman's Wood on the way. You continue west, passing Beardown Tors and Cocks Hill before coming to Higher Willsworthy and Willsworthy Bridge. The final section takes you past Willsworthy Camp into Lydford where you can explore the wonderful Lydford Gorge .",
