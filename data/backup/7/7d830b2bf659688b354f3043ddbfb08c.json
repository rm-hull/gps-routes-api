  "description": "This walk takes you along the Nature Trail in the lovely seal sanctuary in the Cornish village of Gweek. The sanctuary looks after sick and injured seals and is owned by\u00a0The Sea Life Trust. You can follow footpaths through the reserve and along the Helford River which runs through the village. There's also great underwater viewing areas and the\u00a0Humboldt Penguins on Penguin Beach to see. Gweek village is also very pretty with an old stone bridge over Gweek Creek, a village green, a fine local pub and a picturesque quay.",
