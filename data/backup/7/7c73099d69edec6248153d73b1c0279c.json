Despite a lot of research I have been unable to unearth any historical facts about this crossing on the Border County Ride drove road. The main span, crossing the river itself, would appear to date from the late 18th Century. The section on the left of the photograph would appear to pre-date this. There is a very faint engraving on a stone pillar on the western entrance of the bridge which may read 1732. The main span must have been replaced at some time in the 18th Century and 'tagged on' to the remains of an earlier crossing. There are two clearly distinct architectural styles - dressed stone on the main span cf. rough stone on the earlier western approach. If anyone knows any better, I'd love to hear from them."
