  "description": "This short walk visits Blackmoorfoot Reservoir in Huddersfield. The reservoir is located a couple of miles south west of Huddersfield town centre. You can stroll along the water and then follow a bridleway through the countryside to Crosland Edge and the little village of Helme. The reservoir is surrounded by attractive woodland, countryside and views of the Yorkshire Hills. Also look out for migrating birds that visit the reservoir. There is also free parking on the lanes around the site.",
