  "description": "This lovely Kent village includes a number of picturesque cottages, some fine local pubs and a noteworthy church which has been described as the 'Barn of Kent' due to its high scissor beam roof. This circular walk from the village takes you through the surrounding area on some quiet country lanes. On the way there are some pleasant views of the surrounding countryside and a nice stroll along the village's main street. To continue your walking in the area head east to visit the mysterious Dering Woods .  The site is also known as \"Screaming\" wood\u00a0due to reports of paranormal activity in the area. There's two waymarked trails here and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Smarden.
