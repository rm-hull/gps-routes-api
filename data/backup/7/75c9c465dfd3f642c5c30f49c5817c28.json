      "content": "The name Smarden finds its origins in Saxon times, signifying the 'butter valley' and 'pasture,' reflecting its historical agricultural importance. While it stands as a tranquil village today, its historical significance is undeniable. In 1332, Edward II granted Smarden the privilege of hosting a market, a right later reaffirmed by Queen Elizabeth I, who also granted the village the privilege of holding a five-day fair. Amidst this history, Smarden played a role in the dramatic events of 1450 when 66 local men participated in Jack Cade's rebellion, protesting against high taxes and prices. The village boasts the 14th-century church of St. Michael the Archangel, affectionately known as the \"Barn of Kent\" due to its expansive scissor-beam roof that spans an aisleless nave, measuring an impressive 36 feet in width. Archaeological excavations in Smarden have unearthed a treasure trove of English and French coins dating from the 13th to the 16th century. Also noteworthy are the medieval Wealden hall houses, including the splendid Chessenden on The Street. Along the Headcorn Road, you'll find one of Kent's best-preserved cloth halls, distinguished by a projecting hoist used for lifting bales, which still adorns the gable end of the house. Among the village's historic establishments is The Chequers Inn, a 14th-century coaching inn located on The Street. This venerable establishment even has its own resident ghost, a Napoleonic War soldier who met a tragic end within its walls. In comparison, The Bell on Bell Lane, dating back to 1536, represents a relatively recent addition to Smarden's rich tapestry of history."
