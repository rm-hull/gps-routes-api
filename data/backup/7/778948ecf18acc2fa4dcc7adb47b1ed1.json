  "description": "Enjoy a walk around Crummock Water in the Lake District National Park. The route starts at the pretty village of Butteremere and follows the lakeside walking trail along the western shore of the lake. You then return through Mellbreak fell with fabulous views of the lake below. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Buttermere Lake and enjoy the lakeside path there. Loweswater is also not far and is usually a more peaceful option as there are usually fewer visitors to this area. For great views over Crummock Water you could climb Grasmoor fell, which towers above the lake. For a more moderate climb look no further than the delightful Rannerdale Knotts which also overlooks the water. It also includes the beautiful bluebell valley with carpets of the flowers covering the surrounding hills.",
