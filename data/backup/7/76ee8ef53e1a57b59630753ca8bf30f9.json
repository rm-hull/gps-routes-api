  "description": "This walk takes you along the coastal path in Douglas with fine views out to the historic castle on\u00a0St Mary's Isle in Douglas Bay. The tower was constructed to provide shelter to mariners wrecked around the ofter trecherous waters of\u00a0St Mary's Isle.  It is possible to walk out to the Tower of Refuge at low tides at certain times of the year although there is the risk of being stranded as the tide comes in. The best way are the organised walks by the local council with more details on the more information website link. See the video below to get an idea of the walk. This walk starts at the pier and takes you along the promenade, passing the pretty Douglas Promenade gardens and Douglas beach on the way. The route is also known as the promenade cycleway so suitable for cyclists too. The route uses part of the Raad ny Foillan - Isle of Man Coastal Path which takes you around the whole island on foot. You could extend your walk by following the path north to visit Groudle Glen .  One of the Manx National Glens this area includes the popular Groudle Glen Railway, a delightful miniature railway run by local enthusiasts.",
