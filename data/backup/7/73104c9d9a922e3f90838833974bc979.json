  "description": "Explore the beautiful Howth Head Peninsula on this fabulous coastal walk near Dublin. The route is one of the most popular walks in Ireland, with waymarked footpaths taking you along a series of wonderful cliff tops. The area is also great for wildlife spotting with grey seals and a variety of sea birds to look out for on the way. The route runs for nearly 7 miles, passing along the coast on fairly easy paths. The walk starts from Sutton Railway Station which is only a 20 minute train ride from Dublin Connolly station. From here you follow Station Road and Greenfield Road south to the coastal path. The path heads south with views on your right across Sutton Creek and Dublin Bay to Bull Island. The route then bends round to the east, passing along Doldrum Bay before coming to the Baily Lighthouse where a lighthouse has stood since the 17th century. The path then turns north passing Webb's Castle Rock, Gaskin's Leap, Highroom Bed, Piper's Gut and the Nose of Howth before coming to Howth village. Originally just a small\u00a0fishing village, Howth with its surrounding once-rural district is now a busy suburb of Dublin. The area also includes Howth Castle with an estate which includes extensive heathland, Howth\u00a0cliffs, light woodland, and the island of\u00a0Ireland's Eye. You can catch a ferry to the island from the docks just to the north of the village. Here you can see the huge freestanding rock called 'the Stack', which is generally covered with hundreds of seabirds including guillemots, razorbills, fulmars and gulls. Howth is also full of great pubs and cafes where you can stop for refreshments and try some of the excellent locally sourced seafood. The final section descends back to the coast path, before turning north to return to Sutton train station. For a more challenging walk around the peninsula try the Purple Route (Bog of Frogs) which climbs to the hills above the coast. From here there's wonderful views over Portmarnock,\u00a0Sutton,\u00a0Bull Island\u00a0and most of\u00a0Dublin Bay. Just to the north you can try the Malahide to Portmarnock Coastal Walk which provides fine views to the Broadmeadow River estuary and Lambay Island. The Donabate to Portrane Cliff Walk can also be picked up near here. To continue your walking in Dublin head south west from the city centre to visit Tymon Park . There's a number of nice waymarked woodland trails and waterside paths along the River Poddle here.",
