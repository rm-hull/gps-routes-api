  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around the Swineshaw Reservoirs on this route on the Pennine Moors. Start the walk from the car park at Walkerwood Reservoir on Brushes Road. You can then follow the Pennine Bridleway east past Brushes Reservoir to the Higher and Lower Swineshaw Reservoirs. The route then follows footpaths around the Lower Reservoir before climbing to Hollingworthall Moor. Other paths then descend back to Walkerwood and the car park. The reservoirs are located within the Stalybridge Country Park where there are more footpaths to try.",
