  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of the Dartmoor Way from Okehampton to Princetown. The route runs for just under 30 miles with some fine Dartmoor scenery and a series of moderate climbs along the way. There's also a number of interesting towns and villages, some woodland sections, riverside paths and a visit to one of the highlights of the area at Lydford Gorge. Starting in Okehampton the route runs south west towards Sourton, passing Meldon Reservoir on the way. You continue south toward Lydford where you will pass the wonderful Lydford Gorge. It is the deepest gorge in the South West of England and contains a series of lovely waterfalls and interesting geological features. The route continues south to Mary Tavy and Tavistock with nice views of the River Tavy as you go. At Tavistock you head east to Sampford Spiney, before climbing to King's Tor for fine views over the area. After descending the tor, the final section takes you along a dismantled railway line into Princetown, where the route finishes.",

      "content": "You could extend the walk at Princetown by heading to the Foggintor Quarry. You can follow the Dartmoor Way west along a dismantled railway line to reach this splendid hidden gem. Here you'll find a tranquil lake surrounded by the atmospheric quarry ruins. There's also the option of continuing north west to visit King's Tor and Great Staple Tor where there are more great views to enjoy. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dartmoor Walks page."
