  "description": "This Cumbrian village is located in a lovely spot in the Lune Valley at the head of the Lune Gorge. There's an ancient pub dating back to the 1500s and the Tebay Services, a\u00a0motorway service station\u00a0on the\u00a0M6 with family-run businesses and a farm shop. This circular walk from the village explores the surrounding countryside on a series of public footpaths and country lanes. On the walk you will enjoy waterside trails along the River Lune and the Birk Beck where you will pass the Birkbeck Viaduct. You will also pass the Castle Howe Motte and Bailey Castle which lies just north west of the settlement. There's some splendid views of the Yorkshire Dales and the Howgills Hills which lie just to the south of the village.",
