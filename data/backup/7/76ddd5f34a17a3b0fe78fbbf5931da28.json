  "description": "This is a nice easy cycle or walk along the disused railway path running from Exmouth to Budleigh Salterton. It runs along National Cycle Route 2 through rolling countryside and woodland. The path is ideal for families looking for a safe, easy route. Our Exmouth to Budleigh Salterton Coastal Circular Walk uses the South West Coast Path and the railway path to create a circular walk through the area. If you enjoy this ride you could pick up the Exe Estuary Trail at Exmouth and follow the route to Dawlish. It's another great, largely traffic free ride with wonderful views of the Exe Estuary Nature Reserve, the Exeter Canal and the Devon coast.",
