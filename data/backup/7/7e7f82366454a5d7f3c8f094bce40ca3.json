  "description": "This circular walk visits Chelwood Vachery and Braberry Hatch Ponds in Ashdown Forest. It's an appealing place for an easy and peaceful walk with an ancient estate, open heath, views to the South Downs, streams and a forest garden to admire. The walk starts from the Long Car Park on the Wych Cross (A22) road, just east of the Llama Park. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south towards Braberry Hatch where there are some pretty ponds, brooks, photogenic old footbridges and peaceful woodland trails. The route then heads east to the Chelwood Vachery, a medieval estate dating back to at least 1229. From here you follow trails north west to return to the car park.",
