  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the beautiful Northumberland Coast Path on this route from Craster to Alnmouth. Along the way there's lovely beaches, interesting rock formations and fine views to enjoy. The walk starts by the attractive harbour of this little fishing village. Head south and you will soon come to Cullernose Point where there are some striking basaltic\u00a0cliff formations. You continue past Rumbling Kern, an inlet near Howick, with more interesting geology and fine sea views. Around here you will also pass the picturesque Howick Dene. It's a lovely spot where the Howick Burn runs through woodland to meet the sea. There's a pretty beach, a footbridge over the burn and more interesting rock strata. The next stage takes you past some lovely beaches at Sugar Sands, Howdiemont Sands and the little village of Boulmer. You then head past Boulmer Haven and Seaton Point before coming to the finish of the walk with lovely views of Alnmouth Bay. The route uses a section of the St Oswald's Way long distance footpath. You can extend your walk by continuing south to Warkworth on our Warkworth to Alnmouth Walk .",
