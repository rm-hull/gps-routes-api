  "description": "Enjoy an easy walk along the River Ure and the Ripon Canal on this route from Boroughbridge to Ripon. It's about a 6 mile walk along riverside paths and a flat canal towpath with lots of barges, locks and bridges to see on the way. Start the walk from Roecliffe, just to the west of the town. From here you can pick up footpaths running along the River Ure to Newby Hall . The 18th century house is open to the public from 21 March until 1 October. It's a lovely spot with the grounds including views over the River Ure, extensive herbaceous borders and woodland walks. After passing the hall you pick up the Ripon Canal which you can follow into Ripon. The canal forms part of the long distance Ripon Rowel which takes you on a tour of the countryside and villages surrounding the city. You can continue along the trail to extend your walk.",
