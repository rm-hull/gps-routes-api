  "description": "This walk around the Lake District town of Penrith visits the medieval castle before heading up to Penrith Beacon for some lovely views over the area. It's only about a 1.5 mile walk up to the beacon from the town centre but it is a moderately challenging climb, reaching a height of over 900ft at the top. The walk starts from the attractive Castle Park, in the centre of town. The park is a lovely place to start your exercise with attractively laid out rose gardens, flower beds, mature trees and grass areas to enjoy. The route takes you through the park to the ruins of the Grade I listed Penrith Castle. The medieval castle was built towards the end of the 14th century and is owned by English Heirtage. After exploring the castle the route heads through the town to Fell Lane which you follow to Beacon Edge. From here you pick up the footpaths through the woodland to the Beacon summit. To continue your walking in the Penrith area head south of the town centre to Eamont Bridge. Here you can pick up a riverside footpath, heading east to Brougham Castle. Also near Eamont Bridge is the Mayburgh Henge and the King Arthur's Round Table Henge. These interesting historic sites are both well worth a visit. From the henges there is another riverside footpath heading south along the River Lowther. This will take you through woodland to Askham where you can enjoy walks through the attractive grounds of Askham Hall. Near here you will also find Lowther Castle with 130 acres of beautiful gardens and the National Trust owned Acorn Bank. The closest lake to Penrith is Ullswater, a few miles to the south west. You can catch a bus to Pooley Bridge and pick up the long distance Ullswater Way. A few miles to the north east you can try the popular circular walk at Lacy's Caves and Long Meg. The interesting walk visits a series of red sandstone caves on the River Eden and a fascinating Bronze Age stone circle.",
