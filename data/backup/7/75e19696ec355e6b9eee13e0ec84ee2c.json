  "description": "This walk visits Wessenden Reservoir and Moor in West Yorkshire. There's some fine moorland scenery and excellent views from the elevated position of the reservoirs. You can start the walk from the Wessenden Head Road Car Park located just to the east of Wessenden Head Reservoir at Pudding Real Moss. From here you can pick up a section of the Pennine Way and follow the waymarked trail west to the first of the reservoirs. Continue north west and the trail will take you along the Wessenden Brook to Great Hey Cote Hill and the northern reservoir where there's an impressive dam. You can easily extend the walk by continuing north to visit Blakeley Reservoir and Butterley Reservoir .",
