  "description": "The Teesdale Way runs through the\u00a0large market town of Darlington in County Durham. You can explore part of the lovely Tees valley on this circular walk using the long distance waymarked trail. Starting at Blackwell at the south western corner of the town you can pick up the trail and follow the river south to Croft-on-Tees. The route passes Stapleton Manor and Monk End Wood on the western side of the river before coming to the village. You can then cross the river and follow the path back to Darlington on the eastern side of the water. This section runs through Oxneyfield and a golf course before returning to Blackwell. On this section there are nice views of the River Skerne which runs parallel to the Tees. To extend your walking in the area you can also follow the Teesdale Way west to High Coniscliffe and Piercebridge where there is an interesting Roman Fort and bridge. Also of interest is the village of Staindrop and the historic Raby Castle where you will find 200 acres of deer park and gardens surrounding the 14th century castle.",
