  "description": "A circular walk around the Cornbury Park estate in Charlbury. The estate is not generally open to the public but there are public footpaths from which there are fine views of the estate. Highlights on the walk include views of the River Evenlode, several pretty lakes, peaceful woodland trails and views of the deer on the estate. The route starts in Charlbury and heads west to cross the River Evenlode. You then head south along the Lower Park, skirting the edge of the series of lakes in the park. At Finstock you turn north west, passing through a section of Wychwood Forest where there are more lakes and ponds to be seen. The trail continues north along Catsham Lane where you link up with the Oxfordshire Way . You can follow the waymarked trail east back into Charlbury. The estate does run events from time to time allowing access to the internal grounds. See the link below for more details.",
