  "description": "This Warwickshire based market town has come nice canal side trails and nearby pockets of woodland to explore. This circular walk from the town takes you along a section of the Coventry Canal to the nearby Hartshill Country Park. Start the walk from the train station where you can pick up the towpath of the canal just to the north. Follow it south and it will take you past an impressive flight of eleven locks. You continue south east and past Outwood Bridge, Rawn Hill and Mancetter before coming to Hartshill. Here you leave the canal to head south west to Hartshill Hayes Park. Here you'll find 137 acres of woodland and open hilltop with magnificent views across the Anker Valley from the high points. The path then passes the Odbury Camp hillfort before heading north to return to the canal. You can then follow the towpath back into Atherstone.",
