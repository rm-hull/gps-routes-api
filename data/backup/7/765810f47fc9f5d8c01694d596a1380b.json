  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Treeton Dyke and woods in Rotherham. The walk starts on the southern side of the lake. From here you can pick up a footpath heading along the eastern side of the water and the adjacent Hail Mary Wood. The trail heads towards Treeton before returning on the western side where there are more paths on Orgreave Common and the Forgemasters Tip. It's easy to extend the walk by heading a short distance east to visit the neighbouring Ulley Country Park. There's another nice waterside trail around the Ulley Reservoir here.",

It will take you towards Wentworth Woodhouse which is one of the highlights of the area. Head south along the Sheffield Country Walk and there's more pleasant waterside walking around the large lake in Rother Valley Country Park. Harthill Reservoir and Pebley Reservoir are also located nearby. A few miles to the north there's another lovely lakeside trail and lots of wildlife to see in the popular Thrybergh Country Park. The peaceful woodland trails in Wickersley Woods are also located near here."
