Situated on the old colliery tip, views in suitable weather include the Malvern Hills, The Wrekin and the Long Mynd. Baggeridge Brickworks still make a variety of special bricks. Brickmaking and collieries were often bedfellows as the shale brought up from the mines often crushes to good brickmaking clay."

You're also near to Wombourne where you can pick up the popular Wombourne Railway Walk and cycle or walk along the old railway line. Head north from the park and you can try the Wolverhampton Canal Walk along the Birmingham Canal. Also nearby is the circular Brewood Canal Walk. This visits the pretty Belvide Reservoir and the Georgian country house of Chillington Hall with its Capability Brown landscaped park and lake. The noteworthy Weston Park is also located just west of Belvide Reservoir and north west of Chillington Hall. There's more than 1000 acres of landscaped parkland surrounding this 17th century country mansion. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
