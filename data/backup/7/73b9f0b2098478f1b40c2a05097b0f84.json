Situated on the old colliery tip, views in suitable weather include the Malvern Hills, The Wrekin and the Long Mynd. Baggeridge Brickworks still make a variety of special bricks. Brickmaking and collieries were often bedfellows as the shale brought up from the mines often crushes to good brickmaking clay."
