  "description": "Enjoy heathland, woodland and wonderful views on this circular walk in the Quantocks. It's a lovely area with the groups of beech trees known as the Seven Sisters, bronze age burial mounds and the remains of a folly tower. You should also see several Exmoor Ponies around the hilltop and bluebells in the woodland in the spring. The walk starts at the car park just to the east of the hill, and follows good footpaths to the summit. Here you can enjoy wonderful 360 degree views across the Quantocks towards the Severn Estuary. It's a fabulous spot on a nice clear day. The walk then descends through woodland and past Merridge Hill before returning to the car park. The Samaritans Way South West and the Macmillan Way both cross the hill so you could pick these up to extend your walk. For example you could head north and visit Lydeard Hill and Wills Neck, the highest point in the Quantocks. The wonderful Fyne Court is just to the east and is also well worth visiting.",
