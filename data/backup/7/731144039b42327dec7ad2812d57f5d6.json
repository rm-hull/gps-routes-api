  "description": "The Surrey town of Farnham has numerous choices for walkers. There's several woods, commons, hill climbs and waymarked trails to try. The town is also the starting point for the epic North Downs way which runs all the way to Canterbury. This walk makes use of the North Downs Way and the Greensand Way to visit one of the highlights of the area at Frensham Country Park . The National Trust owned site includes the popular Frensham Ponds and lots of nice walking trails. On the way you'll visit the River Wey, the Moor Park Nature Reserve, the attractive village of Tilford and Tilford Common. The route also passes close to the noteworthy Waverley Abbey . Waverley was founded in 1128 as the first Cistercian Abbey in England. You can take a small detour from the route to explore the fascinating ruins which are now owned by English Heritage.",
