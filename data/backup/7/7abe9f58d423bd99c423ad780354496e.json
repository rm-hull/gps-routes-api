  "description": "This Kent based village has a number of local woods and parks to visit. The village itself includes a picturesque village green with a cricket pitch and restored windmill. The wonderful scenery of the North Downs is also nearby opening up many walking possibilities. This walk from the village takes you east to Camer Park and the neighbouring village of Luddesdown. You can follow public footpaths east from the village, past Meopham Court to the country park. There's a number of trails here to follow around the park's 40 acres of ancient parkland, grassland and woods. You can also pick up the long distance Wealdway here and follow it to the nearby village of Luddesdown. The pretty village includes some interesting buildings such as Luddesdown Court and a 13th century Grade II listed church.",

      "content": "Head south along the Wealdway and you could visit Trosley Country Park. Near Luddesdown you can pick up the North Downs Way and follow it east to visit Rochester with its river trails and old castle. The attractive village of Upnor with its English Heritage owned 16th century castle is also worth seeing in this area. To the north there's good cycling and walking trails around Shorne Woods Country Park and Cobham Park where there's an old deer park and a Roman Villa to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Kent Walks and the North Downs Walks pages."
