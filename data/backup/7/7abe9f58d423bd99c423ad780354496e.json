  "description": "This Kent based village has a number of local woods and parks to visit. The village itself includes a picturesque village green with a cricket pitch and restored windmill. The wonderful scenery of the North Downs is also nearby opening up many walking possibilities. This walk from the village takes you east to Camer Park and the neighbouring village of Luddesdown. You can follow public footpaths east from the village, past Meopham Court to the country park. There's a number of trails here to follow around the park's 40 acres of ancient parkland, grassland and woods.\nYou can also pick up the long distance Wealdway here and follow it to the nearby village of Luddesdown. The pretty village includes some interesting buildings such as Luddesdown Court and a 13th century Grade II listed church.",
