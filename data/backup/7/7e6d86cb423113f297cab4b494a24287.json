  "description": "This delightful Wiltshire based town is a fine place to start a walk with miles of trails to explore the surrounding downland and farmland of the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This walk from the town takes you north to climb to the viewpoint and hill fort on the nearby White Sheet Hill. You start in the town centre and head a short distance north to climb to Long Hill. This fine viewpoint is located on the north eastern edge of the town. It's the site of an old 13th century castle and offers great views over the surrounding countryside from its elevated position above the settlement. The route then follows the Mid-Wilts Way north, climbing to White Sheet Hill. Here you'll find the site of an Iron Age Hillfort, an aerial transmitter and a small reservoir. The hill and the surrounding attractive downland is owned by the National Trust and forms part of the wider Stourhead Estate. There are excellent views over the countryside of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire from the hill top. After taking in the views the route descends on the same paths to Mere.",

      "content": "The George Inn is a nice place to enjoy some refreshment after your walk. The 16th century coaching inn has an interesting history with King Charles II visiting the inn on his way from Trent to Heale house whilst fleeing after his defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Inside there's a relaxed dining area and an impressive log fire. They serve good quality food and can be found on the attractive town Square at postcode BA12 6DR."

      "content": "Head west from the hill top and you could further explore the Stourhead Estate around Stourton. There's some lovely footpaths around the gardens and lake on the estate's extensive parkland. The Stour Valley Way long distance trail also starts at Stourton. The Monarch's Way passes through the town. You could follow it west to visit neighbouring Wincanton or head east to visit the Mackintosh Davidson Wood Nature Reserve where there's lots of wildlife to see. Just to the south is the pretty village of Compton Abbas where you can visit Fontmell and Melbury Downs, Compton Abbas Airfield and the highest point in the Cranborne Chase AONB at Win Green Hill. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cranborne Chase Walks and Wiltshire Walks pages."
