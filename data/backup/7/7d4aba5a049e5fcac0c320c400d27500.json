  "description": "This North Yorkshire village is located in Coverdale in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. This circular walk from the village takes you south to explore the scenery of Coverdale. The dale takes its name from the River Cover, a tributary of the River Ure. On the way there's footpaths along the River Cover and a visit to the neighbouring villages of Horsehouse and West Scrafton. To continue your walking in the area head west to explore the hills on Carlton Moor. There's some great views over the area from this elevated spot. To continue your walking in the area head to nearby Middleham where you can enjoy more riverside walks and a visit to the ruins of the 12th century Middleham Castle. You can also pick up the long distance Six Dales Trail here.",
