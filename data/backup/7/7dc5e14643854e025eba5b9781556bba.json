  "description": "This Essex based town is located in the Epping Forest District, close to Greater London. It is accessible on the Central line of the London Underground. Chigwell is located on two long distance waymarked footpaths in the shape of the Three Forests Way and the London Loop. This walk from the town visits the wildlife rich River Roding Meadows Nature Reserve. The pretty reserve lies just to the west of the town and includes wildflower meadows and pleasant trails along the River Roding. You can follow a section of the London Loop to the reserve. To extend the walk continue west into Epping Forest to visit Connaught Water. Just to the east you can visit the woodland and lakes in Hainault Forest Country Park .",
