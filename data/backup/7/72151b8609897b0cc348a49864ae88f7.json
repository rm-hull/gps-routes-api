  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll around this pretty salt water lake in Lytham St Annes. It's a popular spot with a good footpath running around the perimeter of the lake and along the sea front. There are lovely views over Granny's Bay towards Southport and on a clear day the mountains of Wales are also visible. There are good facilities with a cafe and RSPB Discovery Centre. Look out for a variety of wildfowl on the lake and on the Ribble Estuary. These include Canada Geese, Swans, coots, water hens and other smaller fowl. You can also hire row boats and motorboats. The Lancashire Coastal Way coastal way runs past the lake so you could pick this up and head along the coast towards Blackpool to extend your walk.",
