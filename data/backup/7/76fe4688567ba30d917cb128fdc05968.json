  "description": "Visit the spectacular Golden Cap Estate from the village of Seatown on this coastal walk in West Dorset. It's about a 1 mile walk from the car park at Seatown to the top of the Golden Cap. You can follow the waymarked South West Coast Path up to the peak which stands at a height of 191 metres (627 ft). There's fabulous views up the coast in both directions to enjoy from here. After taking in the views you can then descend to the ruined medieval chapel of St Gabriel's. There's also the option of heading Langdon Hill where there's some nice woodland with pretty bluebells in the spring. To extend your walking in the area try the West Bay to Seatown Walk which will take you along the coast to the beautiful harbour at West Bay, near Bridport. You could also head west and look out for fossils on the popular Lyme Regis to Charmouth Walk .",
