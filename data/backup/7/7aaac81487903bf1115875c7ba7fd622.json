  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this large area of woodland in Hampshire. The woods are located just to the west of the town of Alton and have miles of footpaths, tracks and bridleways to try. You can start the walk at the south western corner of the woods where there is a public car park (postcode GU34 5ED). It's located close to Medstead and Four Marks Railway Station so you could also start from their if you prefer. From the car park you can pick up the trails heading east towards Chawton village before following alternative trails back to form a circular walk. It's a peaceful spot and very pretty in the spring where there are lots of bluebells to see. Also keep your eyes for a variety of woodland birds as you make your way along the trails.",
