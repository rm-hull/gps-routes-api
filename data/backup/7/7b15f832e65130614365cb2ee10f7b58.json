  "description": "This circular walk explores the One Tree Hill and Bitchet Common Site of Special Scientific Interest near Sevenoaks in Kent. The dog friendly space is criss crossed by several footpaths leading to peaceful woodland and common land. One Tree Hill has a free car park off Carter's Hill Road from which you can start your walk. From here you head east along a section of the Greensand Way to the viewpoint where you can enjoy some lovely views over the surrounding countryside. After taking in the views you can head north west onto the adjacent Bitchet Common. The area is popular in the spring when you can see lots of pretty bluebells and other interesting plants coming through.",
