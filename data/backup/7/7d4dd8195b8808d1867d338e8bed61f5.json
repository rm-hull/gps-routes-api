  "description": "This popular circular walk takes you around a small, coastal hill in the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. The route runs for a distance of just under two miles with a small climb on the way. The Knott is a popular beauty spot and internationally important wildlife area. The area includes a mixture of limestone grassland, woodland, wet meadow, scree and scrub. It's also renowned for its butterflies and flowers. From the 159 metres (522 ft) high point there are fabulous views over Silverdale and the coastal estuary towards Grange over Sands, Morecambe Bay, the River Kent Estuary and the Lake District fells. There's a handy toposcope at the top which details the landmarks you can see from the summit. This circular walk starts at the car park by the hill and takes you to the viewpoint and through the woodland on public footpaths. It runs for about 1.5 miles with a little climbing on the way. You can continue your walk by picking up the Cumbria Coastal Way which starts at the nearby Milnthorpe Sands. Or you could visit the nearby Leighton Moss Nature Reserve. Also nearby is Warton Crag nature reserve with its rare butterflies and plants. Just to the south, you can follow footpaths to and enjoy a climb to the Victorian Pepperpot monument on King William's Hill.",

The Albion is a good choice with lovely views across the Kent Estuary from the waterfront pub. There's a nice outdoor seating area where you can sit and take in views of Lakeland hills. You may also catch the Arnside Bore if you are there at the right time. The bore occurs at high tides, especially spring tides, where the incoming tide of Morecambe Bay narrows into the river estuary. You can find the pub at 36 The Promenade with a postcode of LA5 0HA for your sat navs."

      "content": "Just to the south east of the hill you will find the atmospheric ruins of Arnside Tower. The late-medieval tower house (or Pele tower) was built in the second half of the 15th century. It's a Scheduled Monument and Grade II* listed building and makes for a striking photo. You can reach it easily by picking up a footpath at Hare Parrock at the southern part of the site. In Arnside you will find the delightful Ashmeadow Woodlands. There's some lovely footpaths here with lots of birdlife to enjoy. The woods can be accessed from the end of Arnside Promenade or walk along the first bit of the coast path and access the woodland from the opening near the coastguard station. Another nice idea is to catch the train over the Kent viaduct to Grange Over Sands on the other side of the river. The Cumbria Coastal way runs along the front, providing great views back over to Arnside. You can also try our Grange-over-Sands and Cartmel Circular Walk which visits the fascinating 12th century Cartmel Priory and the splendidly positioned Hampsfell Hospice. Head a few miles north and you could visit Witherslack and enjoy some splendid limestone scenery at the Whitbarrow National Nature Reserve. Just to the east of Witherslack there's also the Foulshaw Moss Nature Reserve. The reserve has some nice boardwalks to follow over the peat bog. It's also excellent for wildlife with ospreys, hobby, sparrowhawk, buzzard and peregrine to look out for from the bird hides. Follow the Limestone Link east and you could visit a local geological highlight at Beetham's Fairy Steps. Here you will find an unusual natural limestone staircase which you can climb for more excellent views. The little village of Beetham is also well worth exploring with its 14th century ruined manor house and a particularly lovely garden centre."
