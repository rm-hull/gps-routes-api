  "description": "This popular circular walk takes you around a small, coastal hill in the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. The route runs for a distance of just under two miles with a small climb on the way. The Knott is a popular beauty spot and internationally important wildlife area. The area includes a mixture of limestone grassland, woodland, wet meadow, scree and scrub. It's also renowned for its butterflies and flowers. From the 159 metres (522 ft) high point there are fabulous views over Silverdale and the coastal estuary towards Grange over Sands, Morecambe Bay, the River Kent Estuary and the Lake District fells. There's a handy toposcope at the top which details the landmarks you can see from the summit. This circular walk starts at the car park by the hill and takes you to the viewpoint and through the woodland on public footpaths. It runs for about 1.5 miles with a little climbing on the way. You can continue your walk by picking up the Cumbria Coastal Way which starts at the nearby Milnthorpe Sands. Or you could visit the nearby Leighton Moss Nature Reserve. Also nearby is Warton Crag nature reserve with its rare butterflies and plants. Just to the south, you can follow footpaths to and enjoy a climb to the Victorian Pepperpot monument on King William's Hill.",
