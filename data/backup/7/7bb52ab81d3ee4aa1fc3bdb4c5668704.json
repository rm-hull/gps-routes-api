      "caption": "Gravel pits by the River Great Ouse were dug out here between the 1940s and 1960s; the area was designated a nature reserve in the 1980s and is now an important visitor attraction as well as a haven for aquatic wildlife. The lake in this photo is called Heronry South Lake; no herons were in evidence on this occasion, but a swan can be seen in the shadow of the trees."

  "description": "Visit this delightful nature reserve in Little Paxton and enjoy a series of well laid out, waterside walking trails. The paths run around a series of pretty ponds and lakes with a riverside stretch along the River Great Ouse to enjoy too. There's nearly 200 acres to explore with habitats including  meadow, reedbed, scrub and woodland.\u00a0 It's great for wildlife with a heronry plus nightingales and cormorants to look out for. There's two, short waymarked trails to follow around the site. The Heron Trail runs for about 2 miles with a surfaced path for the first mile. The circular trail visits two bird hides where you can watch the Cormorants and Herons roosting on the islands. The 1.5 mile Meadow Trail visits the southern part of the reserve. You'll pass lakes and meadows with a variety of wildflowers such as Wild Roses and Hawthorn blossom. The Ouse Valley Way runs through the reserve so you can pick this up to extend yor walk. If you head south along the river you will soon come to St Neots . Head north and you will come to Godmanchester and Huntingdon .",
