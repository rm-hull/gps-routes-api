  "description": "This walk follows the May Park Trail along the Suir River in the city of Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. The route runs for about 2.5km along a good surfaced path. You can start the walk at Cove Lane and then follow the easy trail east along the river. The route finishes near the Waterford Castle Island Ferry which will take you over to Little Island. The ferry operates across Kings Channel between Ballinakill and the Island's west side. It is a private resort for people staying at the castle hotel. This area is great for bird watching with grey heron, little egret, Eurasian wigeon, greenshank, common sandpiper and commoner waders, common kingfisher and Eurasian jay to look out for. To continue your riverside walking head west to Waterford's vibrant Quay.",
