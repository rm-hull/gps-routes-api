  "description": "This walk follows the May Park Trail along the Suir River in the city of Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. The route runs for about 2.5km along a good surfaced path. You can start the walk at Cove Lane and then follow the easy trail east along the river. The route finishes near the Waterford Castle Island Ferry which will take you over to Little Island. The ferry operates across Kings Channel between Ballinakill and the Island's west side. It is a private resort for people staying at the castle hotel. This area is great for bird watching with grey heron, little egret, Eurasian wigeon, greenshank, common sandpiper and commoner waders, common kingfisher and Eurasian jay to look out for. To continue your riverside walking head west to Waterford's vibrant Quay.",

      "content": "The popular Waterford Greenway also starts in the city. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line to Dungarvan. There's more nice river views as you pass along the Suir and the River Mahon. Head south to the coast and you could pick up the popular Dunmore East Cliff Walk. This wonderful cliff top trail takes you to Portally Cove, Rathmoylan Cove and Ballymacaw Cove on a well maintained path. Near here there's also the Doneraile Cliff Walk in Tramore. The coastal village includes a nice sandy beach with dunes as well. Just east of here you can also see the oldest working lighthouse in the world at Hook Head. It's well worth a visit with guided tours and a maritime exhibition to see. The walk also visits the historic Slade Harbour and castle, which dates back to the 15th century. To the west are the stunning Comeragh Mountains where you can try the popular Coumshingaun Lake Loop Walk or visit the picturesque Mahon Falls. Also in this area there's the Lough Mohra and Rath Beag Loop. The lake is a glacial coum and located in a lovely remote spot with beautiful countryside, forestry and mountains surrounding it. Head west to Carrick-on-Suir and you could pick up the Suir Blueway. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along the River Suir between Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel."
