  "description": "This lovely area in Oxford has nice walking trails along the Thames and attractive meadowland with grazing ponies and horses. The walk starts from the car park near Jericho and follows the Thames through the meadow to Gorstow Lock and the remains of Gorstow Abbey. You then head past Wolvercote Common before returning to the car park. It's a really pretty area with carpets of buttercups in the summer and a variety of wildlife to look out for. Horses, cattle and geese graze the meadow and various birds can be spotted around the water and meadow. It is thought that this area of the Thames is where Lewis Carroll first made up the story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. If you'd like to continue your waterside walking in the area then you could pick up the Oxford Canal or the Thames Path which run past the meadow. Just to the west you will find the expansive Wytham Woods where there's 1000 acres of mixed woodland to explore. You can virtually explore the area using the street view link below!",

It has a great menu and a splendid, large garden to sit out and relax in during the warmer months. Notably, the pub was a frequent haunt of Inspector Morse from the famous ITV series of the 80s and 90s. You can find it on Binsey Lane at postcode OX2 0NG."
