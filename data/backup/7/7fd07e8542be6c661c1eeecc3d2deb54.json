  "description": "This walk takes you through Alum Chine in Westbourne on the Dorset coast. Alum Chine is the largest of the four Chines within Bournemouth. You can start the walk on West Cliff Road in Westbourne and then follow the footpath down through the wooded chine. The pleasant, shady trail runs for just under mile, passing the suspension bridge before coming to Alum Chine Tropical Gardens. It's a fine place for a stroll with good footpaths taking you around a wide variety of interesting plants and flowers. From here there are also great views out to sea and down to the lovely blue flag beach. To continue your walking you could pick up the Bournemouth Coast Path and follow it towards Bournemouth or Sandbanks.",
