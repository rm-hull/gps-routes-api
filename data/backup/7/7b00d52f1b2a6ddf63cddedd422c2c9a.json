There are relatively few privately owned boats on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, probably because it is self-contained and does not connect with the rest of the canal network. Consequently, the few marinas are smaller than the vast affairs to be found on busier canals. This one is just east of bridge 110."

  "description": "This walk from the little village of Gilwern takes you along a pleasant section of the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal to neighbouring Llangattock. Here you can enjoy a climb to the Llangattock Escarpment for some fine views over the area. There's also the Craig y Cilau National Nature Reserve with its wonderful limestone scenery and interesting rare plantlife. The route then follows some pleasant country lanes back to Gilwern. The walk starts in the car park near the pretty Gilwern Wharf to the north of the village. The attractive wharf is a popular place for a stroll with some lovely scenery and a fine canalside pub to relax in after your exercise. Follow the towpath north west toward Llangattock where you leave the canal to climb to the limestone cliffs of the Llangattock Escarpment. The route then heads south east through some lovely countryside, on a series of quiet country lanes. You'll pass Llanelly before returning to Gilwern.",
