The car park provides convenient access to Anses Wood on the hillside leading down to Dockens Water."

The inclosure was 'thrown open' long ago, and without fences the commoners' stock have grazed away the ground cover between the trees shaping the present scene of tall oaks with nothing between."

  "description": "This walk visits a particularly lovely and fairly quiet area of the New Forest. The attractive little pool is located near Fritham and Stoney Cross. It attracts a variety of birdlife and is a great place for a picnic. This walk starts from the Cadman's Pool car park and takes you around the pond to Splash Bridge through the Holly Hatch Inclosure. You then follow Dockens Water back to the car park. It's a nice stretch with riverside willows and pretty bridges over the water. The area is also great for wildlife spotting. Look out for deer, ponies and birds such as finches, firecrests, and woodlarks. If you would like to extend your walk then you could head to Latchmore Brook and the Hasley Hill Inclosure which is only about a mile west of the pool. Our Fritham Circular Walk visits the pool and the pretty Green Pond and Janesmoor Pond.",
