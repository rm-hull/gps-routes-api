  "description": "This circular walk explores London's famous Hampstead Heath. It runs for a distance of just over 3 miles, visiting several of the parks' highlights. The large park covers 790 acres and contains miles of well laid out footpaths. You can climb the 98 metre (322 ft) high Parliament Hill for terrific views of major London landmarks such as Canary Wharf, the Gherkin, the Shard and St Paul's Cathedral. Along the eastern edge of the park are the pretty Highgate ponds which include three open-air public swimming pools. At the northern end of the heath you'll find Kenwood House. This former stately home is run by English Heritage and consists of gardens, ancient woodland and sculptures by Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore and Eugene Dodeigne. Several long distance walking trails run past the heath - you could pick up Dollis Valley Green Walk, Green London Way or the Capital Ring if you would like to extend your walk. The route below is devised for walkers but cycling is also permitted on the heath but please be respectful of other users. Click here to see a map of the heath with the cycle route marked out.",

There's a good range of snack and an outdoor seating area to relax in warmer days. You can find it at postcode NW5 1QR for your sat navs. There's an abundance of fine cafes and pubs around the heath as well. One noteworthy place worth consideration is The Spaniards Inn. The pub dates from 1585 and has some interesting literary connections. John Keats apparently penned Ode to a Nightingale in the garden and the pub is also mentioned in Charles Dickens\u2019 Pickwick Papers. There's an attractive interior with oak-panelled walls, chandeliers, beams and log fires. Outside there's a nice garden with a BBQ on warmer days. You can find the inn on Spaniards Road at the north western end of the heath. Postcode for your sat nav is NW3 7JJ."
