  "description": "This circular walk explores London's famous Hampstead Heath. It runs for a distance of just over 3 miles, visiting several of the parks' highlights. The large park covers 790 acres and contains miles of well laid out footpaths. You can climb the 98 metre (322 ft) high Parliament Hill for terrific views of major London landmarks such as Canary Wharf, the Gherkin, the Shard and St Paul's Cathedral. Along the eastern edge of the park are the pretty Highgate ponds which include three open-air public swimming pools. At the northern end of the heath you'll find Kenwood House. This former stately home is run by English Heritage and consists of gardens, ancient woodland and sculptures by Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore and Eugene Dodeigne. Several long distance walking trails run past the heath - you could pick up Dollis Valley Green Walk, Green London Way or the Capital Ring if you would like to extend your walk. The route below is devised for walkers but cycling is also permitted on the heath but please be respectful of other users. Click here to see a map of the heath with the cycle route marked out.",
