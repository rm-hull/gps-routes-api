  "description": "This is a short circular walk around the delightful Coate Water Country Park in Swindon. The walk begins at the car park and takes you around the 70-acre lake and through the wildflower meadows. The park is a great place to bird watch with Herons, Shags and Grebes among the visitors to the lake. Also look out for deer and foxes in the wildflower meadows. The park also has a Ranger Centre and Information Point and a pitch and putt. Although the route below is devised for walkers the park also has a cycle path running along the lake. For more details visit the Information Point at the car park. To extend your outing you could pick up the Chiseldon and Marlborough Railway Path from the village of Chiseldon. The climb to Liddington Hill also starts from Chiseldon. It's a nice climb which includes a visit to Liddington Castle Hill fort which dates from 7th century BC.",

      "content": "Right on the northern edge of the park you'll find the Richard Jeffries Museum. Jeffries was a Victorian nature writer with a passion for the English countryside. He even gave us a name for it all: wild life. He was born in Coate at the delightful 17th century thatched house which is now a museum to his life and work. The house is also surrounded by lush gardens making it a lovely place for a stroll after visiting the park. You can find the museum at postcode SN3 6AA, just to the north east of the lake. Just a couple of miles south of the park you can pick up The Ridgeway National Trail where there are good cycling and walking trails. You could pick up the path and visit the hill fort at Barbury Castle Country Park and the White Horse hill figure at Hackpen Hill. For more walking ideas in the area see the North Wessex Downs Walks page."
