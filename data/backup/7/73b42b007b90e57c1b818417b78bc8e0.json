  "description": "This historic Norfolk market town sits in the heart of the county. The town includes many interesting features including a Norman church, a Grade II listed windmill and the Mid Norfolk Railway which begins in the settlement and travels along the line to Wymondham Abbey. This circular walk in the town explores Lucy's meadow before heading to the Scarning Fen Nature Reserve. The pretty meadow is located on the western side of the town. There's some pleasant walking trails heading south along a pretty stream to Scarning Fen where you can look out for a variety of birdlife. There's also the information boards on the meadow which tell you about wildflowers and wildlife you can see in the area. This includes little egret, kingfisher, frogs and barn owl. The area is named after Lucy Eyers, a local naturalist who was passionate about Norfolk nature.",
