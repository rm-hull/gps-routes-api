  "description": "This large forest is located near the village of Beddgelert in the Snowdonia National Park. In it you will find miles of walking paths and great mountain bike trails. There are great views towards Snowdon and a nice path around the lovely Llyn Llewellyn. The Welsh Highland Railway also runs through the forest so look out for the fine steam trains as you go. This circular route starts from the car park just off the A4085 but you could also start from the nearby village. You can hire bikes at Beddgelert Bikes and pick up trail maps in the village. The cycle routes are all waymarked so you can find your way easily. The forest is also great for walkers with miles of good tracks taking you through the attractive conifer woodland. The Lon Gwyrfai multi user path skirts the eastern edge of the forest. It's a nice easy ride or walk to try in the area.",

Llyn Gwynant and Llyn Dinas are just a short distance from Beddgelert. Next to the latter you can visit the site of the legend of the Red Dragon at the fascinating Dinas Emrys. There's a lovely trail with river views, waterfalls, attractive woodland and a small hill climb to the ancient ramparts of the ancient fort where there are fine views back down to the lake. Just a few miles to the south west there's the splendid Cwm Pennant to explore. This stunning valley has a number of walking trails with fine views of the Afon Dwyfor and the surrounding mountains to enjoy. The Snowdonia Slate Trail runs through the forest.
