  "description": "This large forest is located near the village of Beddgelert in the Snowdonia National Park. In it you will find miles of walking paths and great mountain bike trails. There are great views towards Snowdon and a nice path around the lovely Llyn Llewellyn. The Welsh Highland Railway also runs through the forest so look out for the fine steam trains as you go. This circular route starts from the car park just off the A4085 but you could also start from the nearby village. You can hire bikes at Beddgelert Bikes and pick up trail maps in the village. The cycle routes are all waymarked so you can find your way easily. The forest is also great for walkers with miles of good tracks taking you through the attractive conifer woodland. The Lon Gwyrfai multi user path skirts the eastern edge of the forest. It's a nice easy ride or walk to try in the area.",
