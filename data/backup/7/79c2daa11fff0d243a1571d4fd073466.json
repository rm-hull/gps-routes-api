  "description": "This North Yorkshire based village is located in the Harrogate district just south of Grewelthorpe. This circular walk from the village takes you south to visit one of the major highlights of the area at Studley Park and Fountains Abbey. The route makes use of a section of the Aislabie Walk, a long distance circular footpath which runs through the area. Start the walk in the village and head south along the waymarked trail to Galphay where there is a woodland section and views of the Holborn Beck. The route continues south through Aldfield and Spa Gill Wood before coming to Fountains Abbey. Here you can explore the fascinating ruins of the 12th century abbey and enjoy a walk around the beautiful Studley Park with its deer park and  Georgian water garden. You can follow a section of the Ripon Rowel north east along the edge of the park and then pick up a bridleway heading north to Galphay Mill and Azerley Park. From Azerley Park it is a short walk back to Kirkby Malzeard where the route finishes.",
