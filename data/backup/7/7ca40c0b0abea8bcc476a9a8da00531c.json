  "description": "Enjoy a short cycle or walk around the large lake in this pretty country park near Ashington. The lake is surrounded by woodland and grassland and there is also a miniature railway to ride. The park is situated on the site of the Woodhorn Colliery and the old colliery buildings have now been turned into a museum. Queen Elizabeth II Country Park is located near the Northumberland Coast between Newbiggin By the Sea and Ashington. Druridge Bay Country Park is only a few miles north so you could continue your walk or ride along the coast to this beautiful park.",
