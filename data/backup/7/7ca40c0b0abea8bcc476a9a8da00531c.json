  "description": "Enjoy a short cycle or walk around the large lake in this pretty country park near Ashington. The lake is surrounded by woodland and grassland and there is also a miniature railway to ride. The park is situated on the site of the Woodhorn Colliery and the old colliery buildings have now been turned into a museum. Queen Elizabeth II Country Park is located near the Northumberland Coast between Newbiggin By the Sea and Ashington. Druridge Bay Country Park is only a few miles north so you could continue your walk or ride along the coast to this beautiful park.",

      "content": "The Woodhorn Colliery Museum is one of the area's highlights and located at the southern end of the park in what was once the largest pit village in the world. It's a fascinating place giving an insight into the area's social history with original buildings and equipment from the former colliery and a fantastic exhibition of miner's paintings as well. Head a couple of miles south into Ashington and you could visit Wansbeck Riverside Country Park. There's more nice waterside trails to be found here along the River Wansbeck. Just to the east you could pay a visit to the coastal town of Newbiggin By the Sea. There's some nice trails along the beach and bay with a noteworthy 13th century church and an interesting old 17th century pub to visit too. To the south there's some nice trails along the River Blyth in Bedlington Country Park and Humford Woods. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northumberland Walks page."
