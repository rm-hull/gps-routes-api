  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk through this popular park in Stevenage. There are several pretty lakes with waterside cycling and walking paths to enjoy. The park covers 120 acres and includes some woodland trails and an on site cafe. To continue your walking in the Stevenage area head just a mile south west of the park to visit Knebworth Country Park. The park consists of 250 acres of rolling hills with ancient chestnut and lime avenues. There's also lots of deer to look out for there too.",
