  "description": "The market town of Axminster sits in a nice location in the valley of the River Axe and within the East Devon AONB. This circular walk takes you along the River Axe before visiting a pretty local nature reserve. It's about a 5 mile walk with a moderate climb up to the nature reserve which sits in an elevated position to the south east of the town. The walk starts just west of the train station where you can pick up a public footpath heading south west along the river towards Higher Abbey Farm. Here you'll also find the remains of the Ciscertcian Newenham Abbey. The route then follows Abbey Gate Lane east to Wyke Green before coming to the Trinity Hill Nature Reserve. The reserve includes heathland and woodland with birds such as Nightjar\u00a0and Dartford Warbler to look out for. There's lovely views from the reserve over the countryside of the East Devon AONB. After exploring the reserve you retrace your steps to Wyke Green before following the Wyke Road back into Axminster.",
