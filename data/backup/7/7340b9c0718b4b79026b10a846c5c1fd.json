  "description": "The market town of Axminster sits in a nice location in the valley of the River Axe and within the East Devon AONB. This circular walk takes you along the River Axe before visiting a pretty local nature reserve. It's about a 5 mile walk with a moderate climb up to the nature reserve which sits in an elevated position to the south east of the town. The walk starts just west of the train station where you can pick up a public footpath heading south west along the river towards Higher Abbey Farm. Here you'll also find the remains of the Ciscertcian Newenham Abbey. The route then follows Abbey Gate Lane east to Wyke Green before coming to the Trinity Hill Nature Reserve. The reserve includes heathland and woodland with birds such as Nightjar and Dartford Warbler to look out for. There's lovely views from the reserve over the countryside of the East Devon AONB. After exploring the reserve you retrace your steps to Wyke Green before following the Wyke Road back into Axminster.",

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "The River Yarty also runs past the town. If you head west of Higher Abbey Farm on this route then you can link up with a footpath running alongside it. A few miles south west of the town you'll come to the attractive town of Colyton. There's nice paths through the River Coly Valley and a wonderful heritage tramway to try here. The town is not far from the splendid Jurassic Coast where there are a whole host of walking routes in the nearby towns of Lyme Regis and Seaton. See the Lyme Regis to Charmouth Walk, Lyme Regis to Golden Cap Walk, Lyme Regis to Seaton Undercliff Walk and the Seaton to Beer Walk for more details. Just to the east there's the National Trust's Lamberts Castle to Coneys Castle Walk. The walk visits historic old hill forts where you can enjoy some stunning views over the countryside of the Marshwood Vale. To the north lies the Blackdown Hills AONB where there are also lots of good opportunites for walkers. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
