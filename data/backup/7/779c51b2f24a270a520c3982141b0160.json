  "description": "Explore 220 acres of country park near Broxburn on this easy cycle or walk.  In the park you will find peaceful woodland and a lovely waterside trail running along the River Almond. Almondell is a haven for wildlife - look out for Roe deer, fox, heron, otters and woodpeckers as you make your way through the park. Also of interest is the excellent Visitor Centre with displays, a gallery, information and a conservatory with a cafe. If you would like to continue your outing you could head north to the Union Canal. You could follow the towpath east into Edinburgh on foot or bike.",
