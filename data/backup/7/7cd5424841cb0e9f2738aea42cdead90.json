  "description": "This coastal Cornish village is located just to the south east of St Austell on the beautiful St Austell Bay. It's a delightful port which has remained relatively unchanged since developing in the late 18th century from the fishing village of West Polmear. The village's Georgian feel has attracted many tourists and filmmakers over the years. There's granite quays, Georgian cottages and a fleet of old sailing ships to see in this special place. This circular walk from the village takes you along the South West Coast Path to Duporth and Porthpean with it's lovely beach. The route then climbs to Castle Gotha where there is an ancient settlement and some fine views to the coast. From here you can follow lanes past the old church in Porthpean before heading back to the coastal path and returning to Charlestown.",
