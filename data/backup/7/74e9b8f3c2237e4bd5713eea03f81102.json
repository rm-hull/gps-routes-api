  "description": "This town in the Swansea Valley has some nice riverside and canalside paths to try. This walk from the town takes you along the Swansea Canal and the River Tawe towards Ystalyfera and Gurnos. On the way there's lots of pretty locks and bridges over the canal and river to see. The walk follows the waymarked St Illtyd's Walk for most of the way. This long distance trail could also be followed south through the Crynant Forest part way along the route.",
