      "caption": "House behind tall trees, West Harling. The village is located in the River Thet valley, and was deserted in the first half of the 18th century. Originally part of a cluster of settlements which all had the name 'Herlinga' in 1086, three of these had become known as West Harling (with its church of All Saints'), Middle Harling (with St Andrew's church) and Harling Thorpe. Middle Harling became part of West Harling parish in 1543. With a new Lord of the Manor, Richard Gipps, the fate of the until then fairly prosperous villages changed: Gipps bought all the houses except for one small cottage and so had reduced the number of dwellings. Gipps' heirs closed the old road, and the foundations of the demolished church in Middle Harling were uprooted to build up a marshy ground. All Saints church today stands isolated. The Hall built by Gipps was demolished in 1931 and conifer plantations cover much of his estate. What remains is a bust in the church placed there by his great-nephew."

The church was extensively restored in Victorian times but has retained a number of mediaeval survivals such as the octagonal font and stained glass from the 15th century Norwich School. There are also a few figure brasses, one depicting a priest in mass vestments . What appears to be medieval panels have been incorporated into the C20 reredos. The church has been redundant for the past three decades and is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the woodland and rivers around the villages of West Harling, East Harling and Bridgham in Norfolk. It's a lovely area for a walk with miles of woodland trails, open heathland tracks and fine views of the River Thet Valley. The walk starts in West Harling which is located about a mile south west of the larger East Harling village. It is a historic place being the site of a deserted medieval village which includes a noteworthy 13th century church. From here you can pick up trails heading south west through the woods before turning north east to meet with the river around West Harling common. The route then returns to the village passing the photogenic Dower House and the old church on the way. After the walk you could stroll into East Harling village and see the old windmill.",
