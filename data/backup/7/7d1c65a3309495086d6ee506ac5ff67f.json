  "description": "This picturesque Yorkshire village sits in a rural location to the east of the city of Leeds near Wetherby and Seacroft. This circular walk from the village uses a section of the Leeds Country Way to visit Saw Wood and the neighbouring villages of Barwick-in-Elmet and Scholes. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Leeds Country Way and follow the waymarked footpath east to Ellerker Lane. You then head south through Saw Wood to Kiddal Bridge and then on to Barwick-in-Elmet. You then head west to Limekiln Hill and Scholes where you turn north to Arthursdale. The walk then follows public footpaths along the old railway line to return to the village. To continue your walking in the area head east across Thorner Moor to visit Bramham Park. The expansive park is one of the local area highlights with its parkland, woodland, ponds and beautiful gardens to explore.",
