  "description": "This lovely riverside walk takes you from Rochester to Aylesford along the River Medway. The route runs for a distance of about 9 miles, along a nice flat section of the Medway Valley Walk. The walk starts at the impressive Rochester Castle, next to the river, in the fine Kent town. The castle sits on the eastern bank of the river and includes a noteworthy 12th-century keep, which is one of the best preserved in England or France. The site is run by English Heritage and includes extensive grounds and gardens. From the castle you head south west along the river, passing Baty's Marshes and then under the Medway Bridges which carry the M2 and the Eurostar railway from the Channel Tunnel to London. You continue through Wouldham Marshes to the village of Wouldham where there are nice views over the river to Halling Common and salt marsh. The next stage takes you towards Burham Marshes where you have the opportunity to take a detour from the route and visit the interesting Medway Megaliths. The ancient stones are located just to the east of Burham. This route continues south past Bushy Wood to the town of Aylesford. You could extend the walk by crossing the river here and heading up to Leybourne Lakes Country Park. There's miles of nice waterside trails to try here. You can extend your walking in the Rochester area by heading to one of the nearby parks or nature reserves. Mote Park, Cliffe Pools Nature Reserve and the Riverside Country Park all have nice walking trails to try. You could also pick up the North Downs Way and head south to Blue Bell Hill where there are fine views over the Downs.",
