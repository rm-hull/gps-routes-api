The hillfort is still a sizable earthwork, but it wasn't discovered as a Neolithic site until 1925, when archaeologist O.G.S. Crawford took an aerial shot that showed more buildings inside the hillfort's ramparts. Only five causewayed enclosures were known at the time; the photograph convinced archaeologist E. Cecil Curwen to investigate the site in 1928 and 1930. These early excavations revealed the presence of the Neolithic site and assigned a building date for the hillfort of between 500 BC and 100 BC."

  "description": "Climb to Trundle Hill and enjoy wonderful views over the South Downs on this circular walk in the Chichester area. The Iron Age Hillfort sits in an elevated position on St Roche's Hill above Goodwood Racecourse, just to the south of the village of Singleton. You can park at the Seven Points car park, just to the west of the hill, at the end of Town Lane. From here you can pick up a section of the Monarch's Way long distance trail to take you up to the hill. From the 675 feet (206 m) summit there are great views of Sussex, Hampshire and the English Channel. You can turn it into a circular walk by continuing along the path towards Goodwood racecourse and then following another bridleway back to the car park. The hill is part of the larger Goodwood Country Park where you can enjoy miles of walking trails through woodland and countryside.",
