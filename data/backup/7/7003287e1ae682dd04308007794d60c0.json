  "description": "A short circular walk around Peene Quarry in the North Downs. The main attraction here is the spectacular views over Folkestone and the south coast down to Dungeness. This is a fairly challenging route with a steep climb but you are rewarded with stunning views. The walk begins and ends at car park near the Folkestone White Horse but it's also worth visiting the nearby village of Peene. The North Downs Way and the Saxon Shore Way both pass the site, giving you the opportunity of extending your walking around Folkestone. Here you could explore the splendid East Cliff and Warren Country Park and enjoy some well laid out paths, a visitor centre, cafe, eye catching steep cliffs and more spectacular views.",

Near here there's also the worthy village of Lyminge where you will find an ancient 10th century church. In nearby Hythe there's Brockhill Country Park and the Royal Military Canal Path. You can follow the towpath to nearby Lympne. To the north east there's the Alkham Valley where you'll find an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The valley includes some fine footpaths and two significant historical sites including the ruins of St Radigund's Abbey and the 11th century St Peter's Church. There's also a fine local pub in the pretty village of Alkham here. At the eastern end of the valley you could visit the noteworthy Kearsney Abbey. There's some beautiful gardens here with ornamental lakes and views of the River Dour the highlights. For more walking ideas in the area see the Kent Walks and the North Downs Walks pages."
