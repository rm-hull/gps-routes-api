  "description": "A short circular walk around Peene Quarry in the North Downs. The main attraction here is the spectacular views over Folkestone and the south coast down to Dungeness. This is a fairly challenging route with a steep climb but you are rewarded with stunning views. The walk begins and ends at car park near the Folkestone White Horse but it's also worth visiting the nearby village of Peene. The North Downs Way and the Saxon Shore Way both pass the site, giving you the opportunity of extending your walking around Folkestone . Here you could explore the splendid East Cliff and Warren Country Park and enjoy some well laid out paths, a visitor centre, cafe, eye catching steep cliffs and more spectacular views.",
