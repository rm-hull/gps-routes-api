  "description": "Enjoy fabulous views of the Mawddach estuary and Barmouth Bay on this popular walk from Barmouth to Fairbourne. There's some fabulous scenery with beaches, harbours, saltmarsh, lagoons and fine views of the surrounding mountains. The walk starts in Barmouth, taking you past the pretty harbour before crossing Barmouth Bridge. The Grade II listed wooden railway viaduct crosses the River Mawddach estuary and is open to walkers and cyclists. It was opened in 1867 and runs for about 699 metres (764 yds) with great views in all directions. The bridge leads you to Morfa Mawddach where you turn west along a lovely footpath running along saltmarsh and lagoons. Eventually you come to the coast where you turn south toward the village of Fairbourne where there is a beautiful two-mile stretch of beach. You could also head north from the village and visit Fairbourne Spit, a long spit of sand and shingle at the mouth of the River Mawddach where it reaches Cardigan Bay. The Fairbourne and Barmouth Railway runs the length of the spit and, at the very end of the headland a ferry service makes the river crossing to Barmouth. To extend your walking in the Barmouth area try the splendid Panorama Walk which takes you up to some splendid hill top viewpoints including the hill fort at Dinas Oleu. This route uses part of the Mawddach Trail which takes you along the old Ruabon to Barmouth railway line on a brilliant cycling and walking trail. Just turn east at the end of the bridge to continue along the trail. It will take you to Dolgellau where you can try the excellent Precipice Walk. You can also try the long distance Taith Ardudwy Way which starts in the town.",
