  "description": "This short circular walk follows the bed of the Brill tramway, through Quainton, Westcott and Waddesdon. You start at Quainton and follow the path to the Buckingham Railway Centre where you will find a working steam museum set in a 25 acre site. The walk then continues through Westcott to the exquisite Waddesdon Manor. Built in the style of a French chateau between 1874 and 1889 for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild the house is also surrounded by formal gardens and an English landscape park. The final stretch takes you through the pretty village of Waddesdon to the finish point at Quainton.",
