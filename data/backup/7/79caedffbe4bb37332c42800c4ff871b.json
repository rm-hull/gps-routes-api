At its opening the park was known as Cranbrook Park, as witnessed by the plaque, but the name was changed in 1907 to register its association with the nearby Valentines Mansion."

The name of a place is quite often originally derived from the watercourse running through it, and as the settlement develops the original source of the name can be forgotten. Here is an example where a small stream, the Cran Brook, a tributary of the River Roding, is running through Valentines Park in Cranbrook. The course of the brook is obviously man-made here and provides the water for the large boating lake downstream."
