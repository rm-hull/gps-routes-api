  "description": "This walk explores the ancient Carn Brea hill fort and the Bassett Monument above Redruth in Cornwall. You can start the walk from the small parking area next to the hill. It's a small car park so you could try the South Wheal Frances car park just to the south at a postcode of TR16 6JX. From the hill top car park you can pick up a circular footpath taking you around the site. This includes the folly of Carn Brea Castle which was built in the 18th century by the Basset family as a hunting lodge. At the high point on the hill there's also the Basset Monument, a Celtic cross\u00a0erected as a monument to\u00a0Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset. On the hill you'll also find attractive gorse heathland, interesting granite rock formations and wonderful views over the surrounding area.",
