  "description": "This walk explores the ancient Carn Brea hill fort and the Bassett Monument above Redruth in Cornwall. You can start the walk from the small parking area next to the hill. It's a small car park so you could try the South Wheal Frances car park just to the south at a postcode of TR16 6JX. From the hill top car park you can pick up a circular footpath taking you around the site. This includes the folly of Carn Brea Castle which was built in the 18th century by the Basset family as a hunting lodge. At the high point on the hill there's also the Basset Monument, a Celtic cross erected as a monument to Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset. On the hill you'll also find attractive gorse heathland, interesting granite rock formations and wonderful views over the surrounding area.",

      "content": "Just to the north you can pick up the Great Flat Lode Trail. This circular cycling and walking route explores Cornwall's heritage mines. For a quieter climb in the town head east and you could visit Carn Marth. The hill is a fine place to explore with another excellent viewpoint, a pretty quarry lake and an outdoor ampitheatre which runs performances during summer. Near here there's another amphitheatre to explore at Gwennap Pit. The site has some historical significance having been used by Methodist preacher John Wesley preached several times between 1762 and 1789. Just a few miles to the east there's some great walking and mountain bike trails to be found at the Poldice Valley. The area has a wonderful moon like appearance with the historic Poldice Mine buildings adding to the atmospheric landscape. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
