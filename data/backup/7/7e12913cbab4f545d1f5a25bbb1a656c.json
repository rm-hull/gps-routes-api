  "description": "This walk follows the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal from Kinver to the lovely Bratch Locks in Wombourne. The route runs for about 9 miles with a series of old bridges, pretty locks and nice views of the Staffordshire countryside to enjoy on the way. The route starts in the village centre and heads east along the River Stour to the canal at Dunsley. You then head north passing Hyde Bridge, Stweponey Bridge and the village of Stourton. You continue north past Ashwood, Hinksford and Swindon before coming into Wombourne. Here you'll find the old Bratch pumping station and the impressive Bratch Locks, originally built as a staircase. It's a popular spot for relaxing with a picnic on a fine day.",

      "content": "Near Greensforge you'll pass close to Highgate Common. There's some nice woodland trails here with 320 acres of lowland heath covered with heather, broom and gorse. It's located about a mile west of the canal. The Kidderminster Canal Walk visits the village from the nearby town. It then climbs to the fabulous viewpoint at Kinver Edge before heading into the woodland at Kingsford Country Park. At the end of the route you can pick up the circular Wombourne Railway Walk which runs along a dismantled railway line and another section of the canal. In Wombourne you could pay a visit to the 18th century Himley Hall. The historic hall is surrounded by \u2018Capability\u2019 Brown landscaped parkland with woodland walks, waterfalls and a large lake. Just to the south west of the village you can pick up the Habberley Valley Circular Walk. This will take you around a lovely nature reserve with woodland, grassland and heathland to explore. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
