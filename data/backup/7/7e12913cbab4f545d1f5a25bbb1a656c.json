  "description": "This walk follows the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal from Kinver to the lovely Bratch Locks in Wombourne. The route runs for about 9 miles with a series of old bridges, pretty locks and nice views of the Staffordshire countryside to enjoy on the way. The route starts in the village centre and heads east along the River Stour to the canal at Dunsley. You then head north passing Hyde Bridge, Stweponey Bridge and the village of Stourton. You continue north past Ashwood, Hinksford and Swindon before coming into Wombourne. Here you'll find the old Bratch pumping station and the impressive Bratch Locks, originally built as a staircase. It's a popular spot for relaxing with a picnic on a fine day.",
