  "description": "This lovely, waymarked trail takes you around the Lochan in Glencoe. The walk follows well defined footpaths through a delightful forest of North American trees planted by Lord Strathcona in the 1890s \u2013 he hoped they would comfort his homesick Canadian wife. The path also runs alongside the tranquil loch with the Glencoe mountains making a truly marvellous backdrop. It's a wonderful area with the beautiful Loch Leven also right next to the trail. The walk is located just to the east of the village of Glencoe. You could start from there or park at car park at the south western end of Lochan. If you're looking for a more challenging walk in the area you could try the Pap of Glencoe walk which starts at the same car park as the Lochan Trail.",
