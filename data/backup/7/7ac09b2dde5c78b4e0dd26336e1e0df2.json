  "description": "This circular walk takes you along the River Shannon in the pretty village of O'Briensbridge in east County Clare. It's a popular National Loop Walk taking you along both the river and the Errina Canal. Starting in the village at the famous bridge, the historical journey runs along the serene canal towpath and riverbank, unraveling the ancient history of the Limerick Navigation. The 15th-century stone bridge connecting O'Briensbridge to Montpelier in Co. Limerick is steeped in tales of Turlough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond. The first bridge, a wooden structure erected in 1506, met its fate in 1510. Undeterred, the O'Briens replaced it with the formidable \"Great Bridge,\" flanked by defensive marble castles, featuring walls of remarkable thickness. This massive structure, with seven arches soaring 15 feet above the river, stood as a testament to the O'Briens' engineering prowess. Alas, the tide of history turned against them in 1537 during a revolt, leading to the capture and eventual demolition of the \"Great Bridge.\" The current stone bridge, dating back to 1750 with later renovations in 1842, stands as a resilient link across the Shannon. The Limerick Navigation system, a marvel of its time, ingeniously bypassed the shallows of the Shannon. Employing three canals and two river portions, this intricate network facilitated the transportation of agricultural products from the west of Ireland to British markets via steamers, barges, and railroads. The legacy of this era echoes through both walking loops, marked by blue arrows on a yellow background, guiding explorers through a landscape woven with the threads of history and ingenuity.",

      "content": "The Lough Derg Way starts in nearby Limerick and passes through the village. The long distance trail takes you north to Lough Derg along the River Shannon and its canals. On the way you will pass neighbouring Killaloe and Ballina. In Limerick itself there's the popular Limerick 3 Bridges Walk which takes you along the river to several of the city's historic highlights. Just south of Limerick there's Lough Gur to explore. The photogenic horseshoe-shaped lake includes walking trails, picnic areas and ancient sites of historical and archeological interest. A few miles north east of Limerick there's the climb to Keeper Hill in the Silvermine Mountains. There's excellent views from the summit and a mountain bike trail to try here. To the south west of Limerick there's the charming village of Adare where you can enjoy a walk along the River Maigue and visit the historic Desmond Castle. There's more trails along the River Shannon on the nearby Castleconnell River Walk."
