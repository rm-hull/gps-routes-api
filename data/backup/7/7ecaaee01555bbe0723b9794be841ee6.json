  "description": "This walk visits Beaver Dyke Reservoir, John O'Gaunt's Reservoir and Scargill Reservoir near Harrogate in North Yorkshire. It's a remote and peaceful spot with some lovely views over the water to the surrounding hills. Beaver Dyke Reservoir was decommissioned in 2015 and is now dry but the other two have nice waterside paths. Start the walk at John O'Gaunt's Reservoir where you can pick up the Dales Way Link and follow the trail east along the water to Beaver Dyke and Liberty Farm. Here you can follow a trail south to visit Scargill Reservoir. On the southern side of the first reservoir you will find the remaining ruins of John O' Gaunt's Castle. The castle was the hunting lodge of John O'Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, who was Lord of the Manor of Knaresborough for 28 years until 1399. There's a nice view to the reservoir from here.",
