  "description": "This walk explores the area around the Wiltshire village of Wootton Rivers in the Vale of Pewsey. It's a very pretty, rural settlement with picturesque thatched cottages, a fine 16th century pub and canalside walks to enjoy. This walk takes you along a section of the Kennet and Avon Canal which runs just to the south of the village. You can follow the towpath east to visit neighbouring Burbage, passing a series of pretty locks with some lovely views of the surrounding hills and countryside to enjoy on the way. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Pewsey Circular Walk and visit the Pewsey Downs Nature Reserve and the Alton Barnes White Horse hill figure. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Wootton Rivers. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
