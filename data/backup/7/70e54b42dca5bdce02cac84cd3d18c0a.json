You can follow the towpath east to visit neighbouring Burbage, passing a series of pretty locks with some lovely views of the surrounding hills and countryside to enjoy on the way. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Pewsey Circular Walk and visit the Pewsey Downs Nature Reserve and the Alton Barnes White Horse hill figure.
