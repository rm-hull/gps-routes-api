The view is of the back of the hall taken from near the Parish Church."

The de Hagley family was responsible for enlarging and rebuilding the church in the 14th century. Evidence of this period is to be seen in three arches of the south aisle, built in the Decorated style, c.1300. A wooden board near the present entrance door lists the Rectors of the parish from 1285. The north aisle was enlarged in the early 19th century, and the church was further enlarged and virtually rebuilt in 1856, when its interior assumed its present day shape. The imposing tower was added in 1865 and a peal of 8 bells was hung."

  "description": "Explore the area around Hagley and Park on this walk around the historic Worcestershire village of Hagley. The walk uses the North Worcestershire Path and other public footpaths to take you through the woodland and countryside surrounding the park. There is also an iron-age hill-fort on Wychbury Hill  and fabulous views of the Malvern Hills , the Clee Hills , Abberley Hills, The Wrekin and, on a clear day as far as The Black Mountains of Wales. The park is located about 12 miles from Birmingham city centre. Clent Hills Country Park is adjacent to Hagley Hall so is a great option if you would like to continue your walk. The North Worcestershire Path also runs past the park. Please note the park itself is not open to the public though the hall is open for tours on certain days. Please see the link below for details. You can extend the walk with a stroll around Hagley village where there is a noteworthy 13th century church.",
