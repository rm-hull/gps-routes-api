The Nar Valley Way footpath crosses the common, following farm tracks through Lexham Estate and commons at Litcham and Castle Acre.\nIn 2006, the Litcham Common Management Committee proposed introducing grazing to preserve the habitat. After approval in 2007, fencing was erected in May 2008, and four Dartmoor ponies arrived in June 2008. The ponies currently graze the western half of the common, with plans to install cattle grids on Dunham Road to allow grazing of the entire common."

      "caption": "East Lexham St Andrew's church. East Lexham's parish church, dedicated to Saint Andrew, is one of Norfolk's 124 remaining Anglo-Saxon round-tower churches. St. Andrew's dates back to the eleventh century and underwent significant restoration in the late nineteenth century. The church boasts fine examples of nineteenth-century stained glass, including a depiction of Saint Michael and the dragon by James Powell and Sons. It also features artwork by Richard Foster, depicting the Nativity, Saint Andrew as a fisherman, and the Day of Judgement.\nSt. Andrew's is thought to be one of the oldest churches in England. According to Pevsner, the building dates back to the Anglo-Saxon era. The mound on which the church stands suggests the site was used for Pagan worship before being taken over by Christians in the seventh century. The original church might have been constructed of wood or wattle and daub. Recent research supports Pevsner's view that the current church was built by Saxons but shows Norman influence. This conclusion is based on the differing styles of the three belfry openings. The east opening, in particular, has a unique stone frame cut out to form a Maltese cross. The belfry contains one bell with a Latin inscription translating to \"I am called the bell of Virgin exalted Mary,\" thought to have been cast by Brasyers of Norwich in the fifteenth century."

      "caption": "Church Street, Litcham. The name Litcham means 'Enclosure homestead/village' or 'hemmed-in land with an enclosure.' It is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Licham, Lecham, or Leccham as 'a Market Town in the centre of Norfolk,' with other spellings including Lucham, Lycham, and Luychesham.\nEdward I granted Litcham the right to hold a weekly market, which did not thrive and ceased by 1836. This market influenced the layout of the village, especially the widening of Church Street near All Saints Church.\nIn Elizabethan times, Litcham was a centre for the local tanning industry, with families like Collinson and Hallcottis becoming wealthy and influential. The Hallcottis family were benefactors, building almshouses and contributing to the church. Mathew Hallcottis is depicted on the village sign with his tanning equipment.\nIn 1831, the population was 771, with over a third being agricultural workers. In 1977, Litcham was designated a conservation village and has eleven listed buildings, including a church and priory dating back to the 12th century. The village lies at a major crossroads of country lanes, with the B1145 being a significant route between King's Lynn and Norwich, formerly a stagecoach route. The 17th-century Bull Inn, which also served as the local law court until the late 18th century, was where horses were changed. The green in front of the Bull Inn once had a row of old cottages and a chapel, demolished in 1968."

The tower has a peal of six bells rung by the Litcham Bellringers. The unusual red and green rood screen from 1536 shows twenty-two saints and features delicate carvings. Female saints depicted include Sitha, Cecilia, Dorothy, Juliana, Agnes, Petronella, Helena, and Ursula. The early 15th-century baptismal font has shields, once painted with arms. The church also has a rare wooden Dutch coffer used for storing books, and the statues\u2019 faces remain intact, unlike those in other local churches.\nThe village also has a Methodist Chapel on Front Street, built in 1909."
