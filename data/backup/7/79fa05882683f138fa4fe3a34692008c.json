  "description": "A circular walk around the Lancashire village of Scorton. The route visits two pretty lakes and peaceful woodland with some moderate climbs providing great views from the high points. It's a lovely area with quiet country lanes, good footpaths and fine views over the Forest of Bowland AONB. The walk starts in the village centre and follows Snowhill Lane past Wyresdale Lake. The route then turns right, passing Potter's Hill Wood before turning south to Grizedale Reservoir. Follow paths along the northern side of the water before picking up a path along the Grizedale Brook through Grizedale Woods. The route then follows Tithe Barn lane back into the village centre. The walk passes close to Nicky Nook , a 215 metre fell which provides wonderful views to the Fylde coast, Blackpool Tower, Morecambe Bay and the Lake District fells. You can pick up a path to the summit from Grizedale Reservoir in order to extend the walk. The Wyre Way long distance trail passes through the area. You could follow the trail north and visit Scorton Lake and Wyre Lake, near the village.",
