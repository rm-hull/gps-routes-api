  "description": "This walk in the Nantlle valley visits the 19th century Dorothea Quarry. The slate quarry is now flooded and is a popular place for scuba divers. The area is also good for walking with a footpath taking you from the village of Nantlle to Talysarn via the quarry. You'll pass the old pump house and the Cornish Beam Engine installed in 1904 to pump the pits. It's an interesting place with nice countryside views to enjoy as well. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could stroll down to Llyn Nantlle Uchaf from the village. There's a nice footpath along the southern side of the lake with good views across the water to the surrounding hills.",

      "content": "You can continue your walking in the area by heading east to climb to the wonderful viewpoint at Mynydd Mawr. The picturesque Llyn Cwellyn can also be found in this area. The quarry is one of the significant sites on the Snowdonia Slate Trail which runs through the area. The circular long distance trail can be used to visit several of the other historic mining areas located in the World Heritage Site. Heading north along the trail would take you to Dinorwic Quarry which was at one time the second largest slate quarry in the world. The quarry is located on the edge of Padarn Country Park where there are some lovely waterside trails along Llyn Padarn and Llyn Peris. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
