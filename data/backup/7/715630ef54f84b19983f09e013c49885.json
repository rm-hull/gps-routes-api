  "description": "This Hampshire based village is in a great location for exploring the countryside and woodland of the surrounding Forest of Bere. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Wayfarer's Walk and the King's Way to visit Creech Woods in the Forest of Bere and the neighbouring village of Hambledon. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the Wayfarer's Walk and follow the waymarked footpath south through the town to Glenfield Farm and Furzeley Corner next to the golf course. The route then heads west to take you into Creech Woods where there are numerous footpaths to explore. In the woods you'll find conifers, heather and lots of woodland birds. At the western end of the forest you can link up with the King's Way near Apless Lane. Follow the trail north and it will take you towards Hambledon via Shirmal Farm and Hoe Gate. At Hambledon you can pick up the Wayfarer's Walk again and follow it south through the countryside to Denmead, passing Rushmere pond on the way.",
