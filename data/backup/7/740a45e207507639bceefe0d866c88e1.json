  "description": "Climb to a height of over 500 feet and enjoy wonderful views over the Bedfordshire countryside on this circular walk near Luton. You can park at the car park on Harlington Road and then pick up the Icknield Way Path to take you across the park. The waymarked paths take you to woodland, chalk downland and grassland. It's great in the summer with lots of wildflowers and butterflies to look out for on the hills.  Keep your eyes peeled for a range of flora and fauna including creeping buttercup, cowslip, orchids, great spotted woodpecker, foxes and badgers. To extend your walk you can follow the John Bunyan Trail and the Icknield Way Path to Streatley. The path passes Sharpenhoe Clappers, Smithcombe Valley and Smithcombe Hill before coming to the village. Sharpenhoe has an Iron Age Hillfort and nice views over the area. If you continue east along the paths then you will come to the lovely Barton Hills National Nature Reserve and Hexton where you can enjoy more climbs through the Barton and Pegsdon Hills. Heading west will take you through the countryside to Toddington where there's a fine 700 year old pub to visit. You can also follow the John Bunyan Trail south to Luton.",
