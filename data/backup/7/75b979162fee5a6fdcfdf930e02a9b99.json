  "description": "This route takes you across the Peachfield and Malvern Commons in the Malvern Hills AONB. The commons are located just to the south of Great Malvern and include a number of easy footpaths to try. There's also great views of the hills which are just to the west of the site. You can start the walk from the car park on Peachfield Common just off Peachfield Road. The site also includes interesting flora with species-rich grassland supported by a number of pretty wildflowers. Look out for lady\u2019s bedstraw, common knapweed, bird\u2019s-foot-trefoil and various orchids. In the summer months you can see lots of pretty butterflies fluttering around the flowers. Just a short distance to the west you will find Worcestershire Beacon . You could extend the walk to climb to this popular summit. From the 425 metres (1,394\u00a0ft) peak you can see 13 counties of England on a clear day. For a longer walk you can try the Malvern Hills Walk which runs along the whole length of the AONB.",
