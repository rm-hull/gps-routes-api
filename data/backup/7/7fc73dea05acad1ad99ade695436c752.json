  "description": "This short walk visits Blackbrook Reservoir near Coalville in Leicestershire. There are walking trails on the southern and northern ends of the water with pockets of woodland and nice views of the surrounding countryside. You can look out for wildlife such as Mandrin ducks  on the way. The Ivanhoe Way long distance footpath runs through Whitwick and Thringstone so you can pick up this path to extend your walk. You could follow the trail through Cademan Wood and the historic Grace Dieu Priory just to the west of the reservoir. If you follow the trail south you can visit Thornton Reservoir which has nice footpaths along the water. You can also link up with Bagworth Heath Woods near here too. The Shepshed Walk visits the reservoir from the nearby town. It then goes on to explore the historic Mount St Bernard Abbey just to the south of the reservoir.",
