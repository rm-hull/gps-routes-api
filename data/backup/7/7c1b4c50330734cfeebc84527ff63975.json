  "description": "This small town in Worcestershire is ideally positioned for river and country walks. There's also some interesting timber framed Tudor buildings and a noteworthy pub dating from the 16th century to relax in after your exercise. This circular walk from the town takes you along both sides of the river to the south of the settlement. It uses a section of the Severn Way to visit nearby Tewkesbury and the neighbouring village of Holly Green. The walk starts on the river where you can pick up the Severn Way and follow the waymarked footpath south to Tewkesbury, passing Queenhill and Bushley. Cross the bridge and you can explore the historic town, enjoying a stroll along the River Avon and visiting the 12th century abbey. This first section follows the western bank of the river on the Worcestershire side. After exploring Tewkesbury the walk heads north on the opposite side of the river. You'll pass Uckinghall Meadow and the village of Ripple. Here you could visit the noteworthy St Mary's Church, a Grade I listed building with \"exceptional\" 15th-century stalls. The final section takes you to Holly Green before crossing the river to return to Upton. The second leg follows the eastern bank or the Gloucestershire side of the river. On the second section of the walk you have the option of heading east to visit Twyning. It's well worth a visit with more footpaths along the River Avon and a splendid riverside pub with a terrace overlooking the water. During the summer boats ferry people up the river Avon from Tewkesbury to enjoy the pub's hospitality.",

They serve good quality food in the fine restaurant area and provide accommodation if you would like to stay in the area. There's also a car park and an outdoor seating area. The pub has literary connections having been mentioned in Henry Fielding\u2019s novel Tom Jones. Two of the rooms were used as the setting for key scenes in the book. It also played a part in the Civil War in 1651 when Royalist troops under the command of Prince Rupert \u201cPartook in drinking strong waters at the inn known as The Lion whereupon a heavy sleep came upon them\u201d. This allowed Roundhead soldiers to cross the bridge into Upton and take control of the church (The Pepperpot) and hold out until reinforcements arrived. The Royalists retreated to Worcester and a week later the King was defeated by Cromwell, effectively ending the Civil War. You can find the inn on the High Street at postcode WR8 0HJ for your sat navs."
