  "description": "These lovely National Trust owned gardens are located near Falmouth in Cornwall. You can stroll through the gardens on well laid out paths taking you to tranquil ponds, pretty streams, orchards, exotic trees and the fabulous cherry laurel maze. You can also wander down to the end of the garden to the delightful hamlet of Durgan on the Helford River. There's a lovely secluded beach with gorgeous views of the river and out to sea. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the adjacent Trebah Garden where you will find 26 acres of sub-tropical gardens to explore. The South West Coast Path also runs past the site so you could pick up the trail and head north east to Falmouth. From Helford Passage you can catch the ferry to the southern side of the river and try our circular Helford River Walk. There's great views over the beautiful estuary, pretty creeks, lovely beaches and nice villages with historic churches to see here.",

There's also the ancient Mabe church and a boardwalk on the adjacent College Reservoir to see here. Just to the east you can pick up the Falmouth to Swanpool and Maenporth Walk and visit the beautiful Maenporth. There's a lovely beach and wonderful scenic cove to enjoy here.
