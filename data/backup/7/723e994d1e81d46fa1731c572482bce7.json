  "description": "The village of Henllan is located near the town of Denbigh in the Welsh county of Denbighshire. There's some nice country trails, an old church, a historic ruined house and a noteworthy 13th century inn for refreshments after your exercise. This walk from the village takes you through the countryside to visit one of the historical highlights of the area at Foxhall Newydd. This interesting old country house is Grade I listed and located just to the south east of the settlement. At the site you can see the ruins of the unfinished house which dates all the way back to the late 16th century. After admiring the photogenic ruins you can then follow footpaths south towards Glan Meerchior. Here you turn west and then north to return to the village.",
