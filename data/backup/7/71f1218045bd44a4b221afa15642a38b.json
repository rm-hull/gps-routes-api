  "description": "This walk explores the parkland, countryside and rivers around the Suffolk village of Coddenham. The rural village lies just east of Needham Market and includes countryside trails and a noteworthy pub dating to the 1500s. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths south west through Shrubland Park. The park includes woodland and parkland with ponds and countryside views. The trails through the park will eventually lead you to the River Gipping where you will find Sharmford Mere and a Rare Breeds Farm. Here you can also pick up the Gipping Valley River Path and follow the waymarked trail north west along the River to neighbouring Needham Market. In the town you can enjoy more waterside walking around the shores of Needham Lake where you can also look out for a variety of water loving wildlife.",
