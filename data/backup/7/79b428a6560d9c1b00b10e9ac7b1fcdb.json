  "description": "Explore 70 acres of wetland, meadows and woodlands on this short circular walk in Leek. The park has good footpaths with views of the River Churnet Valley and the Peak District. The Staffordshire Way runs through the park so you could follow it a mile south to Deep Hayes Country Park if you wanted to extend your exercise. The Caldon Canal and Rudyard Lake are also very nearby. You could follow the Canal Feeder north for about two miles to reach Rudyard Lake. This is a lovely waterside walk which starts in Ladderedge Country Park.",
