The path starts at Consett and heads east towards the coast passing Stanley and Chester-le-Street before joining the River Wear and following it to Sunderland harbour.  You'll also pass Beamish Woods where there's some nice woodland trails and the views of the River Team. It's a fairly flat surfaced path with a number of sculptures, interesting earthworks and fine views of the Durham countryside to enjoy.",
