  "description": "Enjoy a walk around the grounds of this historic castle near Shrewsbury in Shropshire. It's an impressive sight with the ruins of the huge 16th century house and the adjacent Church of St Bartholomew to explore. It's run by English Heritage so there is an on site car park and information boards telling you all about the history of the area. After exploring the castle grounds the route then follows a country lane north east to the neighbouring village of Stanton upon Hine Heath. Here you can pick up a section of the Shropshire Way and follow the waymarked path south east toward Moreton Mill. A quiet country lane will then lead you back west to the castle.",

The circular Wem Walk starts from the train station in the nearby town. It uses part of the Shropshire Way to visit the castle before heading to Grinshill. You could also head into nearby Shrewsbury and try the Shrewsbury Canal Walk and Shrewsbury River Walk. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Walks page."
