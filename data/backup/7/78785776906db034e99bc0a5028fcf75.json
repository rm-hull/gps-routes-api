  "description": "This Hertfordshire based village has some lovely trails through the River Beane Valley and a fine local country estate to explore. This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the area including the Woodhall Estate , The River Beane and Stapleford. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths south to Watton Green before heading south east past Hanginghill Wood to Woodhall Park. The house dates from the 18th century and is a Grade I listed building. There are some good public footpaths to follow around the estate where there's woodland and riverside trails to enjoy. At Woodhall you can pick up the Hertfordshire Way and follow a riverside path south along the River Beane to Clusterbolt Wood and Stapleford. Here you head west towards Bramfield Wood where there are a series of woodland trails to try. The route then picks up a section of the Hertfordshire Chain Walk and heads north east along Perrywood Lane to return to Watton at Stone.",
