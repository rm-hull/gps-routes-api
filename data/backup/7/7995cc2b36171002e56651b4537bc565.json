  "description": "This circular walk visits the Locko Park Estate in Derbyshire. The 18th century house is privately owned but there are some public footpaths running around the attractive parkland. The walk starts from Stanley village which lies just to the north of the park. From here you can pick up country footpaths heading south to the estate where you'll find woodland paths, a pretty lake and views to the historic Grade II listed house. Part of the walk uses the long distance Midshires Way. You could extend the walk by following the trail east to visit the ruins of the 12th century Dale Abbey and the ancient Hermit's cave.",
