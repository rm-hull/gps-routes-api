  "description": "This walk explores the Battlefield Heritage Park, just north of the Shropshire town of Shrewsbury. It is located on the site of the 1403 Battle of Shrewsbury fought between King Henry IV and English rebel nobleman Henry Percy. There is an accessible circular walking trail to follow around the site which also visits the Battlefield Church. Also known as St Mary Magdalene it was built in the fifteenth century to commemorate the battle. The area considered to be the site of the battle remains almost completely undeveloped, although in use as agricultural land and enclosed by hedges. You can start the walk from the car park, just off the A5124, just to the north of Shrewsbury. Other facilities include a series of information panels, a caf\u00e9 and farm shop. To continue your walking in the area head south to pick up the Severn Way and enjoy a waterside walk along the River Severn.",
