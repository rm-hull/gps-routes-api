  "description": "This Nottinghamshire based village is located in the\u00a0Rushcliffe\u00a0borough of the county. The pretty village is noted for its two large\u00a0Elizabethan greens, the larger of which is thought to be the biggest green in England. It's an historic and interesting place for a stroll with several 18th and early 19th century buildings, many of which are listed. This circular walk in the village takes you across the greens to the neighbouring village of Screveton. Here you could pay a visit to the Grade I listed St Wilfrid's Church which dates to the 13th century. To continue your walking in the Car Colston head a short distance west to visit nearby Gunthorpe where you can enjoy a riverside walk along the River Trent Valley Way .",
