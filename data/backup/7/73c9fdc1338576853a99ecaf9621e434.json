  "description": "This circular walk explores the pretty Oxfordshire village of Minster Lovell with its old hall, thatched stone cottages and riverside footpaths. The highlight of the walk is a visit to Minster Lovell Hall built in 1440. Here you will find the ruins of the hall surrounded by an extensive estate and bordered by the River Windrush. The atmospheric ruins include an ornamented entrance porch, south west tower and dovecote. After exploring the hall you can continue along the river to the nearby village of Crawley. Here you will find two Bronze Age bowl barrows near Blindwell Wood and a 19th century church. There are also two pubs where you can enjoy refreshments at the half way point of the walk (more details below). From Crawley another public footpath will then bring you back to Minster Lovell through the countryside. To extend your walking in this area simply head east and visit the pretty town of Burford where there are more nice riverside paths and historic buildings. The village is also located just west of Witney so you could start the walk from the town and follow the river to the old hall. You could also try our Witney Circular Walk which takes you along the river to Witney Lake and Meadows.",
