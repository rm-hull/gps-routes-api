  "description": "Visit this enchanting glen near Uig on this easy walk on Skye. Fairy Glen is a real highlight of Skye and a must see when visiting the Uig area. The walk starts from the Uig Hotel and follows a winding country lane to the beautiful glen. It's about a 1.5 mile walk from the hotel to the prettiest areas of the glen. In the glen you will find waterfalls and pretty pools surrounded by little hills. There's also a small loch in the shape of Lochan Mor. You can climb the hills and Castle Ewen (a tall rocky outcrop) for a lovely view over the area. It's a great place for photography and, if the weather is good, a picnic. Geologists will also love the interesting rock formations. There are lots of little walking trails to try and interesting flora and fauna to look out for. For example you may see buzzards as you climb the hills. If you enjoy this walk then head to the Fairy Pools in Glen Brittle. Here you'll find a bubbling stream with a series of lovely pools and waterfalls.",
