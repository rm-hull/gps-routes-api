  "description": "This circular walk visits Pinkery Pond in the Barle Valley area of the Exmoor National Park. You can start the walk from the parking area on the B3358 just south of the pond. Head west along the road and you will soon come to the YHA Pinkery where there is a track leading north to the pond. It's a lovely remote spot popular with wild swimmers in its deep red peat-infused water. At the pond you can pick up the Tarka Trail and follow the path east to climb to Chains Barrow Hill. There's some nice views over the surrounding moorland to enjoy from this 487m high hill. The walk then picks up the Macmillan Way West and follows it south past Goat Hill before returning to the road and the car park. To continue your walking in the area head east into Simonsbath where there are views of the River Barle and a nice pub for refreshments.",
