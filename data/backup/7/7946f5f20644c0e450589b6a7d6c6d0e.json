  "description": "This walk explores Bostall Woods and Bostall Heath in Abbey Wood, Greenwich. The woods are well known as the former haunt of highwaymen such as the infamous Dick Turpin. You can follow a selection of nice footpaths through the 160 hectare site which includes woodland and open grassland. It's a lovely retreat from the urban surroundings with lots of wildlife to look out for and listen to. Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of woodland birds and butterflies in the summer months. There is a car park on Longleigh Lane where you can pick up the trails. There's paths leading west into Bostall Woods and east into Bostall Heath. Part of this walk uses the Green Chain Walk which runs right through the site. You can pick this up to extend your walk. Heading west will take you to Shooter's Hill and Oxleas Wood where there is an elevated terrace garden with splendid views over the capital and the surrounding counties. Just to the east is Lesnes Abbey Woods where you will find the ruins of the 12th century abbey, an arboretum and more woodland walking trails. Cyclists can reach the woods by following a local cycle route which passes through Abbey Wood.",
