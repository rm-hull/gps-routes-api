  "description": "Enjoy a coastal walk along the North East coast from Whitley Bay to Tynemouth. It's about a three mile walk with nice beaches, bays and cliffs to admire. The walk starts from Whitley Sands and heads south to Cullercoats Bay and the beach at Long Sands. You then pass Sharpness Point before arriving at Tynemouth Castle. The fascinating castle includes moated castle-towers, a gatehouse, a keep and the ruins of a Benedictine priory. It dates from the 13\u201314th century and is situated on a dramatic headland overlooking Tynemouth Pier. You can explore the grounds for a fee payed to English Heritage. After leaving the castle you continue past Tynemouth Pier which is a nice place for an afternoon stroll. It stretches out to sea for about 900 yards (810 metres). There's an impressive lighthouse at the end of the pier and nice views back up to the castle and the mouth of the River Tyne. To extend your walk catch the ferry over to the South Shields and continue up the coast to Souter Lighthouse and Whitburn Coastal Park. Here you can also visit the Leas with its two and a half miles of magnesian limestone cliffs, wave-cut foreshore and coastal grassland.",
