The evergreen leaves and long lasting berries have contributed to Holly\u0092s reputation for \u0093eternity and power\u0094 to ward off destruction and evil spirits. In Shropshire, there is a type of Holly without prickles called \u0093Slike Holly\u0094. It has a white hardwood and was used for carving and making handles such as stock whips. Holly is to be brought indoors only at Christmas otherwise it brings bad luck. Holly is often planted in front of a house to bring good luck. and is thought to bring protection against storms. Gorses are very spiny evergreen shrubs. They have small scale-like leaves. The flowers and seed-pods use small explosions to reproduce. People used gorse to fuel fires for baking, making bricks and cooking."
