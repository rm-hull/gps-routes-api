  "description": "This interesting market town in Lincolnshire is located in the West Lindsey\u00a0district\u00a0of the county. There's some nice waterside trails with the River Trent and the Chesterfield Canal nearby. The town has some interesting history too with the medieval Gainsborough Old Hall, the old market place and a heritage centre to explore. This long circular walk from the town takes you along the River Trent before another long waterside stretch along the Chesterfield Canal . Along the way you'll visit several of the neighbouring village while enjoying fine views of the surrounding Lincolnshire countryside. The route makes use of a section of the long distance Trent Valley Way and Cuckoo Way which run through the countryside to the west of the town. The walk starts on Gainsborough Bridge and follows a footpath north along the western side to the River Trent. You'll pass Morton and Walkerith before coming to West Stockwith. Here you pick up both the canal and the Trent Valley Way and follow the waymarked trail west along the towpath to Misterton. You continue south east to Shaw Bridge where you leave the canal and head south past Gringley on the Hill into the countryside. You then turn east passing Clayworth Woodhouse, Beckingham Wood, Tong's Wood and Dogholes Wood before coming to Beckingham. From here you head east along the Old Trent Road to take you back into Gainsborough.",
