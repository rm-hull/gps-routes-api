  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the lovely Pitsford Reservoir in Brixworth Northamptonshire. The waterside trail runs for just over 6 miles on a nice flat, surfaced path. It will probably take around 3-4 hours to complete the circuit. Start the walk from the car park and visitor centre at Brixworth Country Park on the western side of the water. Then head east to the village of Holcot where you cross the water on the causeway. Other paths will then take you along the northern edge of the water to the car park. The area is designated as a nature reserve so you can look out for a variety of wildlife on the way. Keep your eyes peeled for Northern Shoveler, Little egrets, Great crested grebes and Goldeneye as you make your way through this lovely area. The site is located close to both Northampton and Wellingborough .",
