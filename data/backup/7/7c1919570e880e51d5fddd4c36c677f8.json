  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle through this riverside park in London. There's a cycle trail running through the northern end of the park and footpaths taking you around a boating lake, through Sub-Tropical Gardens and along the River Thames. \u00a0There's 200\u00a0acres (83-hectare)\u00a0to explore with a children's zoo, a boating lake, a bandstand and cafe. There's also a 3 hectare nature area with mixed woodland where you can look out for butterflies and birds such as\u00a0blackcap and bullfinch.\u00a0Good footpaths take you around the lovely Sub-Tropical Gardens with a\u00a0mixture of exotic plants and then to the Old English Garden with a fountain and pretty hedges and flowers. The whole of this circular route is designed for walkers but there is a traffic free cycle track running through the northern end of the park. You can then cross Chelsea Bridge and continue along the Thames to Battersea Bridge.\nThe Thames Path runs through the park so you can extend your walk by continuing along the thames. You could head to the South Bank where there are some of the cultural highlights of the city.",
