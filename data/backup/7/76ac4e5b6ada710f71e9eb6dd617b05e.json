  "description": "Starting at the town of Emsworth on Chichester Harbour, follow this fabulous 70 mile walk through the heart of Hampshire and on into Berkshire. You will pass through the pretty Hampshire towns and villages of Cheriton, Droxford, Hambledon and New Arlesford while also experiencing the beautiful landscape and wildlife in this special county. The path is easy to follow as it is waymarked by metal and plastic disks attached to wooden and metal posts. Highlights on the route in include the National Trust owned Hinton Ampner stately home with its wonderful gardens and Watership Down - the delightful setting for Richard Adams' 1972 novel. The route passes the wonderful 5000 acre estate surrounding Highclere Castle in Hampshire. The house is famous as the location of period drama 'Downton Abbey' and includes the excellent viewpoint at Beacon Hill. There are also some lovely waterside stretches to enjoy at Cheriton along the River Itchen and along the River Arle at New Arlesford. The walk finishes at Walbury Hill, the highest point in Berkshire and the South East of England.",
