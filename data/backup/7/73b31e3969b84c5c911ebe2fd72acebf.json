  "description": "This circular walk tours the countryside around the Essex town of Saffron Walden. You'll visit the ruins of the 12th century Waldren Castle and one of the highlights of the area at Audley End. The trail starts in the centre of town and follows the Harcamlow Way to the splendid Jacobean mansion at Audley End . After exploring the fine parkland and gardens you continue south along the Beechy Ride track to Brakey Ley Wood before turning east to the Debden Road. Here you turn east and follow public footpaths and minor roads back into the town centre. You can extend the walk by continuing south from Brakey Ley Wood along the Harcamlow Way towards Newport . Around here you can pick up a nice trail along Debden Water to Debden Park. Also of interest is the long distance Saffron Trail which starts in Safron Walden. The Icknield Way Path runs just to the north of the town and can also be easily picked up to explore the area.",
