  "description": "The village of Saltfleet is located on the Lincolnshire coast in the East Lindsey district of the county. It's an interesting and scenic place for a stroll with many listed buildings including a 13th century church, a 19th century windmill and two fine local pubs dating back hundreds of years. This walk from the village visits the Saltfleetby - Theddlethorpe Dunes National Nature Reserve. Also known as Rimac the reserve includes sand dunes, salt marsh, sand and mudflats with lots of interesting flora and fauna to see as well. Keep your eyes peeled for birds such as cuckoo, barn owl, redshank and shelduck as you make your way through the picturesque environment. You may also spot the rare natterjack toad if you are lucky. The reserve also includes the unusual and photogenic 'Tank on the Beach'. The Comet tank has been rusting for many years and lies half buried in the sand of the reserve. You could extend the walk by continuing south to neighbouring Mablethorpe where there are some attractive coastal gardens to explore. To continue your walking in the area head north to the Donna Nook Nature Reserve where you can see the grey seal population.",
