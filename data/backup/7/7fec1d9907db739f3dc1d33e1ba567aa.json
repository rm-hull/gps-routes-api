  "description": "Enjoy a short walk to Stainforth Force waterfall from the North Yorkshire village of Stainforth. Start the walk from the main parking area in the village and head west, crossing the bridge over the river. Just to the south of the bridge you will find the pretty falls. Here the River Ribble falls over a series of limestone ledges into a deep, broad pool. In October you can see leaping Salmon on their annual migration up the River Ribble. The falls are located very close to Catrigg Force which you can easily reach from the village. Just head east along the Stainforth Beck and you will soon reach the beauty spot which includes 2 main drops of about 20 feet and a series of smaller waterfalls. You could also pick up the Settle Caves and Waterfalls Walk and visit Scaleber Force , a few miles to the south east of Stainforth. The Settle Riverside Walk will take you from neighbouring Settle to Stainforth along the Ribble Way. You can also visit the pretty village of Giggleswick can also be visited in this area.",
