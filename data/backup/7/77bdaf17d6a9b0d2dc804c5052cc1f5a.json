This plantation of natives and exotics, laid out in the late 1970s/early 1980s, was named after him. It is now within the Leam Valley local nature reserve within the park. 30 or so years on it still looks like a plantation and would benefit from thinning. This would help to dissolve the regimented appearance and allow the remaining trees to develop a more natural form."

  "description": "This super park in Leamington Spa, lies on the River Leam and covers 300 acres. The park is perfect for a relaxing riverside stroll or cycle with National Cycle Route 41 passing through the park. The park includes Leam Valley local nature reserve, a Wetland area with a bird hide, woodland, meadow and riverbank habitats. The long distance Warwickshire Centenary Way passes the park. You could pick up the trail and follow it west along the river and visit the county town of Warwick with its wonderful castle, riverside trails and canal walks.",
