  "description": "Explore beautiful Swaledale on this riverside circular walk in Reeth. There's lovely footpaths to follow along both sides of the river with fantastic views of the surrounding Yorkshire Dales scenery. Highlights on the route include the swing bridge near Reeth, some attractive woodland and the lovely, peaceful river banks. Back in the village you can enjoy refreshments at one of the nice pubs and visit the interesting Swaledale Museum. It covers rural history including life and work in the local area of Swaledale and Arkengarthdale. The long distance Coast to Coast walk passes the village. You could extend your walking by following it north west across Reeth Low Moor. Heading east will take you to Marrick and Maske. Just to the west of the village you can enjoy a walk around Gunnerside Gill. It's a beautiful valley with imposing scars, woodland, waterfalls and the pretty Gunnerside Beck running through the centre. If you were to head east you could visit the popular town of Richmond. There's more riverside trails here with a visit to Richmond Castle and Richmond Falls to enjoy. The Herriot Way also passes through the village. You can pick it up and follow it south west across Harkerside Moor to Castle Bolton. There's some lovely heather moorland scenery to enjoy on this literary route.",
