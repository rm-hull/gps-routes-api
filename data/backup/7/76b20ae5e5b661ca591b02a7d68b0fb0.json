      "content": "For a challenging climb on the island head to the Quiraing, the northernmost summit of the Trotternish. The hike is a favourite for many with some spectacular views to enjoy. The Old Man of Storr is another good option with some wonderful rock formations and views to enjoy. Just to the south is Kilt Rock And Mealt Falls where there's a pretty loch, some wonderful rock formations and a coastal waterfall to see. Head south east and you can visit the Island's capital at Portree. Here you can pick up the circular Portree Scorrybreac Walk and enjoy views of the picturesque harbour, the colourful buildings of Portree town and out to the Island of Raasay. For more walking ideas in the area see the Isle of Skye Walks page."
