  "description": "Visit the fascinating ruins of this 14th century coastal castle and enjoy wonderful views of Tulm Bay on this walk in Trotternish. There is a parking area just off the A855 with a footpath leading to the castle ruins. The castle is surrounded by dramatic cliffs with wonderful views over Tulm Bay and Duntulm Bay. The ruins and surrounding scenery are quite striking and very photogenic.",
