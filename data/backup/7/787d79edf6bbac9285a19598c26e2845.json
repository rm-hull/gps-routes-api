  "description": "This walk follows the Lake Muskry Trail to Lake Muskry in the Galty Mountains of County Tipperary. There is a car parking area north of the lake at the trailhead where you can start the walk. The trail runs for just under 5km so nearly 10km there and back. It's quite a rocky track in places so good hiking boots are advised. Along the way there are wonderful views of the surrounding mountains to enjoy. To continue your walking in the Galty Mountains head north west to the secluded Lough Curra and climb to the excellent viewpoint at Galtymore Mountain.",

      "content": "Just to the east is the historic Cahir Castle. The 12th century castle is well worth a visit with lovely grounds and a fascinating history. You can also pick up the Suir Blueway here. The riverside cycling and walking trail runs along the River Suir from Carrick-on-Suir to Clonmel. To the north west there's more lakeside trails at Lough Gur to explore. The photogenic horseshoe-shaped lake includes walking trails, picnic areas and ancient sites of historical and archeological interest. To the south east is the beautiful Bay Lough. The remote Corrie Lake is located at the The Vee in the Knockmealdown Mountain range, a popular local area for hiking. To the south you'll find Glengarra Woods where there are two waymarked trails, specimen trees and fine views of the Burncourt River. To the north west there's a popular loop walk around the Glen Of Aherlow where you'll find some stunning scenery and peaceful woodland trails."
