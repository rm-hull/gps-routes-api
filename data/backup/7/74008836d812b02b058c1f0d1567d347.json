  "description": "This large area of heathland and woodland near Albury is very popular with walkers and cyclists. There's 250 acres to explore on a myriad of footpaths and bridleways. The area consists of lowland heathland, woodland and acid grassland. You can park at the Blackheath car park on Blackheath Lane to start your circular walk across the common. Chilworth railway station is also just to the north of the common. This is another good start point if you are coming by public transport. The paths then take you across the common and through Blackheath Forest. There's some nice sandy paths and lots of pretty heather to look out for in the late summer. It's easy to extend your walking in this lovely area. You can follow the Downs Link to St Martha's Hill. It's a couple of miles to the north of the common with the path passing Chilworth Manor on the way. From the  574 feet (175 m) hill summit there are great views over the North Downs. Other footpaths head north east from the common taking you to Albury Park. The 150 acre estate includes parkland, woodland and pretty lakes.",
