  "description": "Enjoy a lovely waterside walk along the River Hamble on this easy walk in southern Hampshire. The walk starts in the village of Warsash at the mouth of the River Hamble. Park at the car park on Shore Road and pick up the public footpath heading north along the river. It's a delightful trail, passing Bunny Meadows and Wendleholme Nature Reserve with views across the water to Hamble-le-Rice. The trail runs for just over two miles, finishing at Lower Swanick, opposite Bursledon . The Solent Way runs through Warsash so this is a good option if you would like to extend your walking in the area. You can pick up the path and enjoy views over Southampton Water. You can also catch the ferry to Hamble-le-Rice and explore Hamble Common or follow the Strawberry Trail around the beautiful Hamble Valley.",
