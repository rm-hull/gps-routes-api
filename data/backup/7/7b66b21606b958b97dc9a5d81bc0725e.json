The Clappers Bridge, with two arches, is dedicated to the mill stream, while the other, a three-arched bridge, crosses the River Rother and dates back to the 16th century, though its piers might be older. The middle arch of the latter was widened in the 1780s to accommodate barge traffic to Midhurst. In 1967, with the road expansion, the Clappers Bridge was entirely reconstructed, and the Fittleworth Bridge was partially rebuilt to support a road approximately 25 feet wide, about double its original width."
