The Clappers Bridge, with two arches, is dedicated to the mill stream, while the other, a three-arched bridge, crosses the River Rother and dates back to the 16th century, though its piers might be older. The middle arch of the latter was widened in the 1780s to accommodate barge traffic to Midhurst. In 1967, with the road expansion, the Clappers Bridge was entirely reconstructed, and the Fittleworth Bridge was partially rebuilt to support a road approximately 25 feet wide, about double its original width."

  "description": "This historic West Sussex village is located near Pulborough in the District of Chichester. This walk takes you around Fittleworth Common and Hesworth Common where there are some peaceful woodland trails to explore. There's a handy car park on Hesworth Common where you can start the walk. Part of the route uses the Serpent Trail which runs through the village. The long distance, waymarked path is a good way to further explore the area. At the southern end you can visit Fittleworth Bridge over the River Rother Navigation. Near here there's an historic 14th century pub for some refreshments. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Fittleworth. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",

      "content": "The Swan, located on the north side of the Rother Navigation, is a coaching inn, possibly tracing its history to the late 14th century.  Today, this establishment operates as a family-run pub, known for its fine food and drink served in a comfortable setting. Across the road, there's a haycart arch bearing the pub's name. The walls inside are adorned with numerous paintings depicting the local scenery, many of which were given as payment for accommodation, a practice that ceased in 1920. The hotel section features corridors with low ceilings. Notably, the pub was frequented by Edward Elgar, the renowned music composer, and Hubert Parry, famous for composing 'Jerusalem'. Rudyard Kipling, another regular guest, is honoured with quotes from his 'Jungle Book' embellishing the beams in the bar. In 1924, the Ancient Order of Frothblowers was founded here, adopting the motto 'Lubrication in Moderation'. This group focused on fundraising for disadvantaged children, but their activities ceased as the prohibition movement gained traction in Parliament. The Swan has 12 en-suite rooms located in the main building and four cottage rooms in the old stable block. Many rooms retain original features and are decorated in a traditional style. You can find them at postcode RH20 1EN."
