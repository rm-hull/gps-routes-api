  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside around the pretty village of Bloxham. The village is located on the edge of the Cotswolds and has some nice public footpaths to try. The walk runs for just under 5 miles and includes a small climb on the way. From the high points there are lovely views over the surrounding countryside. The village itself is very picturesque with old thatched cottages and an interesting museum chronicling its medieval history. This walk starts in the village and follow paths up to Hobb Hill before turning round to pass Tadmarton Farm. You head south to the neighbouring village of Milcombe where there's a dovecote and an old church. The walk then follows a country trail north east to return to Bloxham. At the northern end of the route you'll come close to Broughton Castle . The moated manor house has some nice paths to follow around the grounds and gardens.",
