  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside around the pretty village of Bloxham. The village is located on the edge of the Cotswolds and has some nice public footpaths to try. The walk runs for just under 5 miles and includes a small climb on the way. From the high points there are lovely views over the surrounding countryside. The village itself is very picturesque with old thatched cottages and an interesting museum chronicling its medieval history. This walk starts in the village and follow paths up to Hobb Hill before turning round to pass Tadmarton Farm. You head south to the neighbouring village of Milcombe where there's a dovecote and an old church. The walk then follows a country trail north east to return to Bloxham. At the northern end of the route you'll come close to Broughton Castle. The moated manor house has some nice paths to follow around the grounds and gardens.",

      "content": "Bloxham is located just to the south west of Banbury. You can continue your walking here by picking up the towpath of the Oxford Canal or following footpaths along the River Cherwell. The Adderbury Circular Walk is another good option for stretching your legs. The neighbouring village is located just to the east and well worth a visit. To the east is neighbouring Kings Sutton where there's some interesting old buildings including a 13th century church. The fascinating Rollright Stones and the beautiful Blenheim Park are also located close by. Just to the east you can pick up the Bodicote Circular Walk. This visits some of the local highlights including Bodicote Lake, the restored 19th century windmill, the 13th century church and the Georgian Bodicote House. There's also an 18th century pub to visit in the pretty village afterwards. For more walking ideas in the area see the Oxfordshire Walks page."
