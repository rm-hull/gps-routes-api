  "description": "Enjoy a walk around this large open space in South London. The common covers 220 acres (89 hectares) with miles of walking trails taking you to open grassland, three ponds and a Victorian bandstand. Wide trails take you to the flower gardens and around Eagle, Long and Mount Ponds. There's also a cycling trail running through the centre of the park. Facilities include a running track, bowling green, Australian rules football pitches, Tennis courts and a skateboard park. The Windmill Pub at the park's eastern side is a good place for refreshments. If you'd like to extend your exercise you could head south through Balham to Tooting Bec Common where there are more cycling and walking paths to try. The Capital Ring long distance walking trail runs through Wandsworth Common about a mile west of Clapham Common. You can pick this up to extend your walk.",
