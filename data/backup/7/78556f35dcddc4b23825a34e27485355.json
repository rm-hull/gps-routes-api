They are remnants of the broad leaved woodland that covered much of Middlesex in prehistoric times. Much of the woodland was lost to the construction of settlements and the need for fields for crops in the middle ages, and then to suburban development in the first part of the twentieth century. Today the wood forms Bayhurst Wood Country Park."
