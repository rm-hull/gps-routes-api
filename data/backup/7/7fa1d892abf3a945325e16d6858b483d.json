  "description": "This Monmouthshire based town is a great place for riverside and country walking. The Usk Valley Walk passes through the town providing an opportunity to explore the beautiful river valley on a good waymarked footpath. Just west of the town there's Cefn Ila where there's some lovely peaceful woodlands with several specimen trees in an attractive arboretum. A few more miles to the west there's Llandegfedd Reservoir where you can enjoy a splendid waterside circular trail. Near here you can also pick up the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and enjoy easy walks along the towpath. This circular walk in the town starts from the car park at Usk Island next to the river. You'll then pass along the old railway to visit the historic Usk Castle. You can explore the Grade I listed ruins and enjoy some splendid views over the area from the elevated position of the castle. The walk then takes you through the town centre before a riverside stroll takes you back to the car park. Scroll down for a list of further walks near and around Usk.",
