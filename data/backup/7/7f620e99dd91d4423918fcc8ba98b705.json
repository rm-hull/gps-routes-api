  "description": "Enjoy a spectacular coastal walk on this popular route in County Clare. The cliff top hike runs from the little village of Doolin to the Moher Tower at the southern end. There's fabulous views of the Atlantic coast and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. At peak times there are 30000 birds from 20 different species to see on the cliffs. Keep your eyes peeled for puffins and razorbills in particular. Sea life is also in abundance with grey seals, porpoises,\u00a0dolphins,\u00a0minke whales\u00a0and\u00a0basking sharks to look out for in the waters below. Other features on the route include the fascinating geology of the area with Namurian shale and sandstone dating from 300-million years ago. There's also an excellent visitor centre with interactive media displays covering the geology, history, flora and fauna of the cliffs. The centre includes a nice cafe for refreshments after your exercise. The walk starts in Doolin and heads south west to the coast, with views of the Aille River which reaches the sea near the base of the Cliffs of Moher. Here you pick up the coastal path and continue past Doonagore Castle on your left. The 16th-century\u00a0tower house is now a private holiday home. You continue south to O'Brien's Tower which marks the highest point on the cliffs at around 214 metres (702\u00a0ft). The tower was constructed in 1835\u00a0as an observation tower for the\u00a0many Victorian\u00a0tourists visiting the area. From here there are wonderful views as far as Galway Bay\u00a0and the\u00a0Aran Islands. Loop Head\u00a0at the southern tip of Clare and the mountains of\u00a0Kerry are also visible. From the tower you head on to Stokeen Cliff and then to Moher Tower at the southern end of the cliffs. The ruined watchtower\u00a0was built in the early 19th century and stands on\u00a0Hag's Head, where the\u00a0cliffs\u00a0form an unusual\u00a0rock formation\u00a0resembling a woman's head looking out to sea. It's a striking location and makes a fitting end to the walk. The cliffs can also be approached from the village of Liscannor, located just to the east of the southern section. The Burren Way long distance trail can be followed west to reach the site. To continue your coastal walking in County Clare head to Loop Head . The peninsula is much quieter and includes great views of the River Shannon Estuary and the Atlantic Coast. You can virtually explore the trail using the google street view link below!",
