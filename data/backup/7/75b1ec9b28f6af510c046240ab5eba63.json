When the castle was built (12th Century) the valley below was under water, forming a shallow lake, and guests and supplies would have arrived by boat at a quay at the bottom of the steps at the barbican."

  "description": "The Dorset town of Sherborne is a fine place for a stroll with two sites of major historical interest and an attractive town centre. This circular walk starts from Sherborne Abbey before heading through the town to the castle. The walk then explores the grounds and gardens of the castle before passing along Sherborne lake to the nearby Sherborne Old Castle. It's a lovely walk with waterside paths along the 50 acre lake, woodland trails and a beautiful 42 acre landscaped garden with specimen trees, herbaceous borders and sweeping lawns. You can also explore the fine 16th-century\u00a0Tudor\u00a0mansion built by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1594. Inside you can view collections of art, furniture and porcelain, and Raleigh\u2019s original kitchen. The now ruined 12th century old castle was built as the fortified palace of\u00a0Roger de Caen,\u00a0Bishop of Salisbury. You can visit the castle and grounds between April and October. Please note : both Sherborne castle and Sherborne old castle charge separate entry fees. See the link below for more details. There are free public footpaths across Sherborne Castle Park to the south of the castles. The Macmillan Way long distance trail runs through Sherborne so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Heading south will take you to Honeycombe Wood, Lillington and Yetminster.",
