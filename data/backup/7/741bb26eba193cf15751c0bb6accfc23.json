  "description": "This pleasant Lancashire based village is a fine place to visit and start a walk from. There's canalside paths and some lovely coastline where you can look out for birds such as Cormorants, Curlews, Lapwings and Oystercatchers. There's also a number of nice pubs and a noteworthy church dating back to 1500. This route from the village uses sections of the Lancaster Canal and the Lancashire Coastal Way to create a circular walk around the settlement. The walk starts on the canal in the village and heads south along the towpath towards Bolton Town End and Hest Bank. Here you leave the canal to head towards the coast at the Morecambe Bay National Nature Reserve where there's a large variety of wildlife to look out for. The Lancashire Coastal Way will then take you north to Red Bank, Wild Duck Hall and The Old Mill where you follow a lane back into the village.",
