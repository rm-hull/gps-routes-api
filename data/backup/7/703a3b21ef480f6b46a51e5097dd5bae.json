  "description": "This pretty country park is situated on the River Blyth at Hartford Bridge, 5 miles south of Morpeth and north of Cramlington. There are 100 acres of woodland and meadow to explore and a lovely long waterside stretch along the River Blyth. There's also an abundance of wildlife with woodpecker, nuthatch, tree creeper, kingsfisher, red squirrel, roe deer and fox. There are a number of self guided walking trails and a bridleway for cyclists. The park has an excellent visitor centre with maps, guides and a cafe. If you have time you could head half a mile east to Bedlington Country Park where there are more riverside trails to try through Humford Woods .",
