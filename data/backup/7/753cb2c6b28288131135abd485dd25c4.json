Their names are derived from\u00a0Old English\u00a0hunig, \"honey\", and\u00a0burna, \"stream\", the whole meaning \"(places on) the stream by which honey is found\". Boundary changes in 1931 moved Cow Honeybourne into Worcestershire and the two parishes were united in 1958."

  "description": "This attractive rural village is located in Worcestershire, near the villages of Honeybourne and Badsey , the town of Evesham and the beautiful Cotswolds . The historic settlement includes a Jacobean manor house, a Gothic hall\u00a0and the noteworthy Fleece Inn, a medieval English pub owned by the National Trust. This circular walk takes you into the surrounding countryside, first heading north to Sheen Hill before picking up a footpath along the Gate Inn Brook. This will take you to neighbouring Honeybourne where you can visit the 13th century Thatched Tavern pub and admire a series of ancient timber framed properties.",
