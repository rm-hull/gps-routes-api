  "description": "This circular walk around the market town of Hawes visits three lovely waterfalls and takes you through some beautiful Yorkshire countryside. The town is in a great location for walkers with the lovely scenery of the Yorkshire Dales and some good waymarked footpaths to follow. The walk makes use of the Pennine Way and other public footpaths to visit Hardraw Force , Cotter Force and Aysgill Force waterfalls. The 10 mile route starts in the centre of the town and heads north, crossing the River Ure, before climbing along Hardraw Beck to Hardraw Force Waterfall.  The impressive waterfall is England's highest single drop waterfall, falling some 100ft.  Access to the waterfall is through the 13th century Green Dragon Inn . The route then climbs west to Bluebell Hill, reaching a height of over 1000ft and providing great views over the surrounding area. From here you descend back to the River Ure, where you head west along the river to Cotterdale Beck and on to Cotter Force Waterfall. The falls are very pretty, comprising of six steps, each with its own small waterfall. From here you head back along the river to Appersett, where you follow the Widdale Beck towards Appersett Viaduct. The route then heads back towards Hawes where you can take a detour south along the Gayle Beck to visit Aysgill Force Waterfall. There's lots of other nice walks to try in the Hawes area. You could try the climb to the splendid Great Shunner Fell . The hill is the highest point in Wensleydale and can be climbed from the village of Hardraw which this walk visits. A few miles to the south east of the town you can visit the lovely Semer Water . The lake has a nice walking trail which visits Keld Scar Waterfall, Crooks Beck and Marsett Beck.",
