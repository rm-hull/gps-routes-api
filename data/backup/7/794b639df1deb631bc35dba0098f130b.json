  "description": "This circular walk in Nidderdale visits Eavestone Lake and the Picking Gill Nature Reserve. The secluded and tranquil lake is something of a hidden gem and a lovely area for a peaceful walk. The route starts just south of Eavestone where you can pick up the Ripon Rowel and follow it east along the lake and through Fishpond Wood. You continue towards Sawley before turning west to Picking Gill where there is a pretty nature reserve with interesting flora and fauna. The route then heads west and north to return to the lake.",
