  "description": "This short walk in Keswick visits a beautiful\u00a0viewpoint overlooking Derwentwater. You can start the walk from the theatre car park just north of the crag. The route then passes along the lake before coming to the viewpoint. Here you can enjoy a rest on the bench and take in the stunning views across the lake and Derwent Isle. You will also pass the memorial to John Ruskin, the leading English\u00a0art critic\u00a0of the\u00a0Victorian era. He has strong associations with Keswick and greatly admired the view from Friar's Crag. After taking in the views you can return to the car park the same way or head around Strandshag Bay and return through Cockshott Wood. Just to the east of Cockshott Wood you can take a small detour and visit Castlehead Woods and the Castlehead viewpoint. It's worth visiting as you can enjoy wonderful views of the surrounding fells with a toposcope\u00a0naming them all. If you would like to extend your walk further you could continue south and explore Great Wood before climbing to Walla Crag .\nAlso nearby is the wonderful Castlerigg Stone Circle .",
