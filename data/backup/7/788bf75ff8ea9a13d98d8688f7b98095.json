  "description": "This expansive forest in Dumfries has miles of good walking paths and several mountain bike trails to try. This circular route follows a number of the cycling trails in the forest incuding the Rollercoaster, The Elevator and The Big Step. You can see more detail on the Open Street Map below. The cycle trails are marked in blue on the map. The route starts from the main parking area on the eastern side of the forest where there's also cycle hire nearby. On the way you'll pass Larch Hill, the Marthrown of Mabie, Marthrown Hill and Dalshinnie Loch. At the western side of the woods there's also Lochaber Loch where there's a waterside trail and a nature reserve. You can enjoy wonderful views down to the loch from the Red cycle trail. For walkers there's several waymarked trails with wildlife sculptures, gardens and bluebells to see on the way. Also look out for wildlife including red squirrels, badgers, roe deer, foxes, woodland birds and bats.",
