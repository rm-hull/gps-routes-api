In 1953 he hosted the BBC's inaugural natural history programme live from his Slimbridge home. He later rose to fame as a television personality who provided commentary on the Queen's coronation and marriage. Sir David Attenborough refers to Sir Peter as his \"hero\" and the \"patron saint of conservation\" and cites his groundbreaking television career as an inspiration."

  "description": "Travel along the Wash on this lovely, easy walk through Norfolk. The path starts by the River Nene near to Naturalist and painter Sir Peter Scott's lighthouse north of Sutton Bridge. You then follow the coastline of the Wash to the Lynn Channel on the River Great Ouse. The river then leads you to the finish point at King's Lynn Ferry. Wildlife is abundant on this walk with numerous species of bird to look out for including oystercatchers, curlew, redshanks and marsh harriers. Scott is best known as the WWT (Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust) founder. There is a tribute and statue to him at the WWT London Wetland Centre. More information on his life and works can be found on the photograph panel text below.",
