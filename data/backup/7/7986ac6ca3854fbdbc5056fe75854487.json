  "description": "This large nature reserve in Silverdale, is the perfect place for a peaceful walk in beautiful surroundings.  Leighton Moss is the largest reedbed in the north west and has a number of well laid out trails for you to explore the area.  An abundance of wildlife can be seen in the reserve including breeding bitterns, starlings, bearded tits, marsh harriers (see video) and red deer.  There is also a fantastic cafe in a converted barn. Leighton Moss is located in the Arnside and Silverdale AONB and on the Lancashire Coastal Way walking route so there is scope for continuing your walk towards Arnside or Carnforth. You could also pay a visit to the nearby Arnside Knott. This small hill has woodland walks and fabulous views over Silverdale and the coastal estuary. Also nearby is Warton Crag nature reserve with its rare butterflies and plants. Just to the north west you can visit Eaves Wood, Gait Barrows and enjoy a climb to the Victorian Pepperpot monument on King William's Hill. The reserve is located right next to Silverdale railway station so is easy to access.",
