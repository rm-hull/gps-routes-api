  "description": "This delightful Oxfordshire village sits in a lovely spot in the Chiltern Hills, close to the River Thames. This circular walk from the village uses several of the local waymarked trails to explore the surrounding area. On the walk you will pass along sections of The Swan's Way , The Ridgeway and the Thames Path National Trail. The route visits the Ewelme Watercress Beds Local Nature Reserve, Wallingford and the neighbouring village of Benson with some lovely countryside trails along the way. Highlights include a lovely riverside stretch along the Thames through Wallingford, the picturesque Benson Lock and Ewelme's own nature reserve. The reserve can be found on the High Street on the western side of the village. Here you'll find beautiful open gardens backing onto the watercress stream with a wide variety of interesting plantlife to see as well. It's a fine place for an easy stroll and one of the highlights of the area.",
