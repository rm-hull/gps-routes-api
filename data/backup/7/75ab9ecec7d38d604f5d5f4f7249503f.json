      "caption": "Entrance to Durris Forest. Durris Forest is a predominantly coniferous forest situated south of the River Dee, approximately three kilometres west of Netherley in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The southwest boundary of Durris Forest is delineated by the A957 road, which separates it from Fetteresso Forest. Within Durris Forest, there are several smaller named woodlands. The ancient route known as Elsick Mounth traverses the Grampian Mountains within the bounds of Durris Forest. Notable natural landmarks in the vicinity include Red Moss and Meikle Carewe Hill. Additionally, the area is rich in historical features, including Raedykes Roman Camp, Muchalls Castle, and Maryculter House. Roman legions marched from Raedykes to Normandykes Roman Camp, passing through Durris Forest as they sought higher ground to avoid the bogs of Red Moss and other low-lying mosses associated with the Burn of Muchalls. This march utilised the Elsick Mounth, an ancient trackway crossing the Grampian Mountains to the west of Netherley."

From here there are wonderful views over the Deeside countryside and hills. In addition to the walking trails the forest has miles of wide tracks suitable for mountain biking.
