  "description": "This long circular walk takes you on a tour of the beautiful Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire. It runs for just over 30 miles and includes several pretty villages, canal side walking and a visit to the National Trust's Waddesdon Manor. The path starts and ends in Wendover first heading towards Great Kimble and then onto Dinton where you will find the impressive Dinton Hall. The route continues to Eythrope, crossing the River Thame and passing Eythrope Park and Eythrope Manor House. You continue through the countryside past Waddesdon, Hardwick, Long Marston and the Aylesbury Canal before joining the Wendover Canal Arm near Aston Clinton for the final waterside stretch back to Wendover. On the canal near Wendover you can take a small detour to visit the picturesque Weston Turville Reservoir where there's lots of water loving birdlife to see on the water.",
