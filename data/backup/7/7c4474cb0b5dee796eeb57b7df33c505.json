The mill has a long tradition of flour milling, with operations dating back to at least the 12th century. By the 19th century, the mill was under the tenancy of the Brocket Hall Estate, which was associated with prominent figures such as Lords Melbourne and Palmerston, who were both Prime Ministers during Queen Victoria's reign. This connection to historical estates and significant figures highlights the mill's importance not only in local industry but also in the broader historical landscape of the region. The mill continued to operate as part of the agricultural and economic life of the area, contributing to the sustenance of local communities over the centuries. Today, Lemsford Mill is recognised for its historical value and its role in the region's rich heritage."

Near here there's also the Lemsford Springs Nature Reserve where there's good wildlife spotting opportunties. It's only about a 1 mile walk south from the woods so a nice option if you fancy continuing your exercise. You can follow the waymarked Welwyn Garden City Centenary Walk to the springs and then go onto visit other local highlights.Near Lemsford there's also Stanborough Park where there's some lovely lakes and parkland to explore. Just to the north west of the woods you will find the noteworthy village of Ayot St Lawrence. The village is notable for its connections with the playwright George Bernard Shaw and is the site of Shaw's Corner, his old residence. There's also a ruined 12th century church and a lovely pub which dates from the 14th century to see here. Near here there's Codicote where you can visit the nearby Hoo Park and enjoy some pretty bluebell woods and a rather fine old bridge over the River Mimram. The village is also very attractive with several timber framed buildings and a historic 16th century pub to admire."
