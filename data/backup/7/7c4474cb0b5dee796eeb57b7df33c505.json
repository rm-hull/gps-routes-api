The mill has a long tradition of flour milling, with operations dating back to at least the 12th century. By the 19th century, the mill was under the tenancy of the Brocket Hall Estate, which was associated with prominent figures such as Lords Melbourne and Palmerston, who were both Prime Ministers during Queen Victoria's reign. This connection to historical estates and significant figures highlights the mill's importance not only in local industry but also in the broader historical landscape of the region. The mill continued to operate as part of the agricultural and economic life of the area, contributing to the sustenance of local communities over the centuries. Today, Lemsford Mill is recognised for its historical value and its role in the region's rich heritage."
