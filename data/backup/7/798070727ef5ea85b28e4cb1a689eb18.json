  "description": "This large area of common land near Nailsworth is criss-crossed with miles of nice footpaths. The common is also in an elevated position so there are great views of the surrounding Cotswold hills, countryside and villages. You'll reach a height of well over 600ft on the edge of the Cotswold Escarpment. On a clear day you can even see across the Severn Vale into Wales. It's also great for flora and fauna with skylarks and various orchids to look out for. This walk starts from the little village of Amberley on the western side of the common. From here you can pick up the footpaths leading towards Bownham, Burleigh and Box. To extend your walking in the area you can head to the nearby Rodborough Common. The common is located just to the north and consists of nearly 300 acres of attractive grassland, scrub and woodland. Also nearby is Selsley Common. It's located just to the west and has more nice paths and rare flora and fauna to discover. The common is located very close to the popular town of Stroud where you can enjoy a nice waterside walk along the Stroudwater Canal.",

There's also a nice outdoor terrace where you can relax during the warmer months. You can find it on Rooksmoor Hill at postcode GL5 5NB. Also consider the Bell Inn in nearby Selsley. It's a pub of some note dating from the 16th Century and also grade two listed. The pub can now boast listings in The Good Food Guide, and The Good Pub Guide as well as 2AA rosettes for their food. In the summer months you can sit outside and enjoy fine views of the surrounding countryside. In the winter there's roaring log burners to warm you up after your chilly walk!"
