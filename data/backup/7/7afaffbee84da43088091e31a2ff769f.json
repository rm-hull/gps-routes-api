  "description": "Enjoy a long circular walk around this large forest in Carmarthenshire. There's miles of nice, wide cycling and walking trails with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The route starts in at the visitor centre and car park in Pembrey Country Park. From here you can head up trails heading north west through the park and into the forest. Here you'll find wonderful, towering Corsican Pine, picnic areas, a pond and a wide variety of interesting flora and fauna. Look out for White water Lily, Early Purple Orchid and Red Campion as you make your way along the paths. St Illtyd's Walk passes through the forest so you could pick up the trail to extend your walk. Head east and you will soon come to Penybedd Wood and Burry Wood. Just to the north of the forest you will find the interesting town of Kidwelly. Our circular walk visits the pretty quay, the River Gwendraeth and the historic Kidwelly Castle.",
