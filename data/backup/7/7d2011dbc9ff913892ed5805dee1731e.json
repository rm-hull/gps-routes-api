Sir William \"The Splendid\" Dormer built a manor house here which burnt down. There are substantial earthworks beside the house, and a series of fishponds in a nearby wood. The original gateposts still stand, incorporated in a field wall, and some avenues of now rapidly ageing trees. Otherwise, what would at one time have been a small country house and park has reverted to farmland. This is a view of the house from a semi derelict field containing various items of agricultural junk such as this antique here."

This is about the best shot I could get without wading into mud. There are more ponds in the wood to the south. They are even more overgrown."

  "description": "This Oxfordshire based village is located a few miles south east of the university city of Oxford. The rural village is located near the River Thame and has some nice country footpaths to try. There's also a number of noteworthy historical buildings including pretty thatched cottages and a church with Norman features. This circular walk from the village takes you to Ascott Park, Newbury Hill and the neighbouring village of Chalgrove. You can pick up the footpaths from the village and follow them south east to the farmland and village. On the way there's some pleasant countryside and views of the River Thame which runs through the area. Other features include the picturesque old watermill near Stadhampton and the quaint 17th century thatched cottages in Chalgrove. To continue your walking in the area head south west to visit nearby Dorchester on Thames where you could pick up the Thames Path National Trail. The Chalgrove will take you to the historic Brightwell Park Estate and Brightwell Baldwin.",
