  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Fife Coastal Path from Leven to Lower Largo. The route runs for just under 3 miles along a fairly flat, beachside path. There's great views of the coast and the surrounding hills for the duration. You will also pass the Lundin Links golf course where pretty burns run into the sea. Start the walk on the front in Leven and then follow the waymarked trail north east along the beach and the golf course. The walk finishes at the picturesque harbour in the quaint old fishing village of Lower Largo. You can extend the walk by picking up the Lower Largo to Shell Bay and Elie Coastal Walk which continues east along the trail.",
