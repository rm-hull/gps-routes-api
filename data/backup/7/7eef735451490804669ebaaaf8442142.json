Stackpole Quay dates from the 18th century when it was built to ship out limestone from a nearby quarry and to unload supplies for Stackpole Court, owned by the Earl of Cawdor. The Cawdor family moved away after the Second World War, and Stackpole Court itself was demolished in 1963, leaving this lonely harbour to a peaceful existence sheltering the odd fishing vessel. Here in the summer of 1972 it was the sort of 'off the beaten track' place that visitors could feel a sense of achievment in seeking out. All that has changed today; this is now part of the National Trust's Stackpole Estate, immensely popular with tourists. At least this ensures that the site is safe from inappropriate development, but some of the magic has been lost in the process."

  "description": "Explore the wonderful National Trust owned Stackpole Estate on this circular walk in the Pembrokeshire National Park. In the estate you'll find miles of coastal footpaths, woodland trails and waterside sections along the beautiful, large lake. Stackpole is located near Freshwater East on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path . There's 12 square kilometres to explore on a variety of good footpaths. This walk starts at the Stackpole Quay car park and takes you along the coast path to Stackpole Head with wonderful views of Barafundle Bay. You'll also pass the striking natural stone arches known as the Lattice Windows. The route then heads towards Bosherton passing the delightful Stackpole Warrens. This area of grassland is great for wildlife watching with butterflies and birds visiting the wildflower meadows in the summer months. At the little village of Bosherton you can enjoy refreshments at the pub and visit the fascinating Norman church of the late 13th century. From Bosherton you continue along the lovely Stackpole Lily Ponds. Look out for waterlilies in the summer and wildlife which includes the resident otters. The final section takes you along the deer park track, returning to the car park. If you'd like to continue your walking in this area then you could head along the coast to the fascinating, 13th century St Govan's Chapel .",
