  "description": "This Essex based town has three local country parks and some fine countryside trails to explore. Despite being located on the outer edge of London there's some fine open space around this busy commuter town. This walk in the town explores St Faith's Country Park on the western side of the town. The area is a nice place for a stroll in the town with 16 hectares of attractive open grassland fields bounded by mature hedgerows. There are various footpaths taking you to areas of scrub, wet woodland, watercourses and ponds. To extend the walk head north west and you could visit the nearby Weald Country Park. The expansive park is one of the local highlights with miles of walking and cycling trails to try.",
