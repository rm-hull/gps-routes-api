  "description": "This Cambridgeshire village is located just to the north of St Ives in a pleasant rural spot. This walk from the village takes you along a section of the Pathfinder Long Distance Walk. The long distance circular walk visits the RAF Pathfinder stations at Wyton, Graveley, Oakington and Warboys. It's an interesting and historical walk visiting several memorial sites on the way. On this section you will head through the countryside to neighbouring Colne and Bluntisham before finishing at the River Great Ouse. Here you can link up with the Ouse Valley Way to continue the walk. You will also find the wildlife rich Ouse Fen nature reserve in this area.
