  "description": "Explore this large expanse of heathland on this walk near Liphook in Hampshire. There's a parking area on the western side of the common where you can pick up the trails. Head north from here and you will soon come to Waggoners Wells where you will find a series of man-made ponds and the pretty Cooper's Stream. After enjoying the waterside trail you can also visit Bramshott Chase where you will find an attractive mix of broad-leaf and coniferous trees, glade and open heathland. To extend your walk just head north to the adjacent Ludshott Common where there are miles of additional footpaths to follow. If you enoy this walk then just a couple of miles to south east you'll find Marley Common where there's acres of lovely heathland, woodland and meadows to explore. At nearby Liphook you can pick up a number of long distance trails to take you into the South Downs. The Sussex Border Path, Serpent Trail and the new New Lipchis Way all run through the area just to the south of the common so it's easy to extend your walking in the area.",

      "content": "Just a few miles to the south east there's the significant site of Black Down to explore. The Down includes some fine ancient woodland and is notable as the highest point in the South Downs, commanding wonderful views towards the coast. Just south of Black Down there's the worthy village of Lurgashall to explore. The picturesque settlement includes a pretty village green, a quintessentially English cricket pitch, a millpond, a historic Saxon church and a number of historic timber framed properties to admire. In nearby Bordon there's the Hogmoor Inclosure to explore. The area has lots of family activities with woodland walking and cycling paths plus a sculpture trail. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
