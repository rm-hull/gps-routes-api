  "description": "This Leeds based town is located to the east of the city. There's some nice country trails, a canal, a major nature reserve and several parks to explore nearby. This walk from the town takes you to the Aire and Calder Navigation Canal and RSPB St Aidan's to the south of the town. On the way there's some nice farmland scenery, visits to some of the local villages and lots of wildlife to see at the nature reserve. The walk starts at Garforth Train Station where you can pick up the Leeds Country Way . Follow the waymarked trail south and it will take you through the town and out into the countryside. At Brecks Wood you turn west before turning south to the villages of Swillington and Little Preston. You'll then pass a series of lakes at Swillington Park before arriving at the Aire and Calder Navigation Canal by Swillington Bridge. You can then follow the pleasant canal path south east to Fleet Bridge where there is a lock and marina. The trail crosses the canal to enter St Aidan's, a large RSPB nature park with excellent birdwatching opportunities and attractive wetland areas. Follow the footpaths through the site and you can pick up the Leeds Country Way again around Little Preston. The route then retraces its steps back to Garforth train station.",
