  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the Noar Hill Nature Reserve from the village of Selborne, in the Hampshire Downs. It's a very pretty area, notable for its extensive flora, including many widlfowers and 11 species of orchid. In the summer months you can see several species of buttefly fluttering around the flowers. These include marbled white (Melanargia galathea), brown argus (Aricia agestis), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), and holly blue. Birds include common buzzards, hen harrier and green woodpecker. The walk starts from Selborne where you can pick up the Hangers Way long distance trail. Follow the path south past Homestead Farm before heading east to climb past High Wood Hangar to Noar Hill. It forms one of the westerly outposts of the chalk hills called the South Downs, and rises to a maximum height of about 210 metres above sea-level. The path then runs along Noar Hill Hangar before descending to Charity Farm. You then follow country lanes back to Homestead Farm before heading back to Selborne where you can enjoy refreshments at the Selborne Arms pub which has a good selection of real ales and a decent menu too. To extend your walking in the area head to Selborne Common and climb and Selborne Hill, one of the highest points in the county of Hampshire. The area is owned by the National Trust and has a number of nice woodland trails to try. You could also continue south along the Hangars Way to visit Hawkley, Shoulder of Mutton Hill and the town of Petersfield .",
