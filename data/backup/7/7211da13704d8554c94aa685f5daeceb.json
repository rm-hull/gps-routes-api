  "description": "This large area of woodland has some lovely waymarked footpaths including the delightful Fforest Fawr sculpture trail. It's a lovely, peaceful area with well laid out paths, pretty streams, old mining caves and lots of woodland wildlife to look out for. In the spring months you can also see carpets of bluebells, wood anemone and wild garlic flowers. You can pick up the trails from the Castle Coch car park in Tongwynlais. There are several waymarked trails including the sculpture trail with a number of beautifully carved wooden pieces including a dragon, a wizard and other mythical creatures. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the tea room. The Taff Trail cycling and walking trail also passes through the forest so mountain bikers can pick up the trails too. To extend your walking in the area you can head a mile to the west and climb Garth Hill . From the summit you can enjoy fantastic views of Cardiff, the Bristol Channel and the Taff Valley. Also round here you can pick up the long distance Taff Ely Ridgeway Walk and visit the beautiful Ely Valley and Taff Vale.",
