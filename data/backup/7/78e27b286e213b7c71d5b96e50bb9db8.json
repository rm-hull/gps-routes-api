  "description": "This large Sheffield park has miles of nice walking trails to try. You can enter the park at Hunters Bar and then follow the pretty Porter Brook through woodland to Bingham Park and the lovely Forge Dam at the western end. It's an easy stroll of just over 2 miles to the dam from the park entrance. The brook has lots of pretty waterfalls, stepping stones and rocky pools. It leads to two ponds which attract various birdlife. After your walk you can enjoy refreshment at the good sized cafe. If you'd like to visit the park by bike then you can follow National Cycle Route 6 from the city centre. It goes via the wonderful Sheffield Botanical Gardens which are also well worth a look. They are only a short walk from Endcliffe park and cover 19 acres with 5,000 species of plants, manicured lawns, ornate fountains and the Grade II listed glass pavilions. The park is the start and end point for the 14 mile Sheffield Round Walk. This circular route visits the parks, countryside, woods, waterways and villages surrounding the city. You can extend your walk by continuing along the signposted walk to Porter Clough and the village of Ringinglow on the edge of the Peak District.",
