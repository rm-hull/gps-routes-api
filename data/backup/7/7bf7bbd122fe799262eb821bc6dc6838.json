  "description": "This pretty village is located within the Kent Downs AONB, just south of Canterbury. The village includes a 14th century church and the 17th century and Broome Park, a Grade I listed building with gardens. For walkers there are some fine trails taking you through the North Downs and the Elham Valley. This route uses sections of the Elham Valley Way and the North Downs Way to create a circular walk around the village. On the way there's nice views of the Nailbourne river, a tributary of the Little Stour. On the outward leg you'll visit Kingston, Charlton Park, Bishopsbourne, Bourne Park and Bridge. You then head through Bifrons Park before passing Higham Park, a Grade II* listed neoclassical style house and gardens. The route then crosses Barham Downs before returning to the village.",
