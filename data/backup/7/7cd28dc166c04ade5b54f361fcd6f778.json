  "description": "This picturesque village in Devon is a popular spot for tourists with its attractive mill pond, weir, old church, pretty cottages and views of the River Dart. You can stroll down to the quay, visit the mill pond and then go to see the 800 year old yew tree in the churchyard. There's also a charming pub dating back hundreds of years and winding streets with classic old Devon houses to see. This walk takes you from the village to nearby Totnes . On the way there's nice country views and a visit to the River Dart. The walk starts at the public car park next to the mill pool in the village. From here you follow country lanes through the village and the countryside to Aish. You then head west to Fleet Mill before turning north west to enter Totnes. The walk passes through the town before finishing by the river.",
