  "description": "This picturesque village in Devon is a popular spot for tourists with its attractive mill pond, weir, old church, pretty cottages and views of the River Dart. You can stroll down to the quay, visit the mill pond and then go to see the 800 year old yew tree in the churchyard. There's also a charming pub dating back hundreds of years and winding streets with classic old Devon houses to see. This walk takes you from the village to nearby Totnes. On the way there's nice country views and a visit to the River Dart. The walk starts at the public car park next to the mill pool in the village. From here you follow country lanes through the village and the countryside to Aish. You then head west to Fleet Mill before turning north west to enter Totnes. The walk passes through the town before finishing by the river.",

      "content": "The historic Church House Inn is well worth a visit for some post walk refreshments. It's located in a lovely spot near the old church and was formerly known just as the Church House, a meeting venue for the parish. Up until the first half of the 17th century, it was used at festival occasions, especially at Whitsun Church Walk. Today, the premises are leased by the church to the tenant on a commercial basis. It's a charming village pub with good food and an outdoor area. You can find it near the mill pond and car park at the start of the walk at postcode TQ9 6SD for your sat navs."

A few miles to the north there's the historic Berry Pomeroy Castle to explore. Here you'll find the ruins of a 15th century castle surrounded by pleasant woodland trails. The site is run by English Heritage so there's good facilities with a car park, gift shop and cafe. The John Musgrave Heritage Trail can be picked up in this area too. The waymarked trail runs from Maidencombe to Brixham, visiting several of South Devon's interesting historical sites on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
