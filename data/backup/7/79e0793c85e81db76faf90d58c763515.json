  "description": "This park has two pretty lakes set in 144 acres of country park. It is located between Bedford and Northampton on the River Great Ouse near the villages of Harrold and Odell in Bedfordshire.  You will find river meadows, a nature reserve, two picturesque lakes and a range of managed habitats. There is also free parking and refreshments in the Tea-Zels Cafe. There are a number of well maintained walking paths around the lakes and through the nature reserve while cycling is permitted along the lakeside bridleway. The North Bedfordshire Heritage Trail also runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk if you have time. You could follow the trail east to visit nearby Felmersham and Sharnbrook where you'll find pleasant riverside trails, a Norman church, a wildlife rich local nature reserve and a delightful mill theatre converted from the historic old water mill.",
