  "description": "This coastal Welsh village makes a great base for exploring the Llyn Peninsula on foot. This walk uses a section of the Llyn Coastal Path to create a circular route around the village. On the way you'll visit a fine coastal viewpoint and pass the area where the ferries depart to Bardsey Island. This walk starts in the village and follows the path west along the pretty beach and Aberdaron Bay. You then head south to Porth Meudwy where you can catch boats to Bardsey Island. The island has some nice walks and is a great place for birdwatching. You continue along the southern tip of the peninsula to Porth Felen and then onto Mynydd Mawr. At Mynydd Mawr the picnic site has views which, on a fine day, take in Cardigan Bay, Bardsey Island and the Wicklow Mountains. The old coastguard hut here includes an exhibition to the natural history of the area, and a mural created by local children. At Porth Llanllawen you leave the coast to head east through the countryside on footpaths and country lanes. The paths will take you back to Porth Meudwy where you can rejoin the coast path and return to the village. To continue your walking in the area head east along the coast path to Abersoch. There's nice views here to the Saint Tudwal's Islands where you can see seals at certain times of the year.",

The picturesque 17th century manor house is surrounded by some beautiful ornamental gardens with great views over Cardigan Bay and Hell's Mouth from the elevated position of the house. Head north along the coast path and you could visit Whistling Sands and Porth Iago. These two popular beauty spots include lovely secluded beaches, ancient hill forts and fine viewpoints."
