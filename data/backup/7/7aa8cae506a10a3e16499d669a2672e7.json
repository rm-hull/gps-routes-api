  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty lake in Stoke-on-Trent. There is a good footpath running for about 1 mile around the lake. It's a great area for wildlife watching with tufted duck, kingfisher and great crested grebes to look out for around the lake and conservation area. It's a lovely area with attractive woodland around the pretty lake and a nice relaxed feel to the place. The lake also has good facilities with a cafe, visitor centre, free car park and picnic tables. Cyclists can easily reach the lake by following National Cycle Route 5 from Kidsgrove or Stoke on Trent. If you would like to extend your walk then you can pick up the Trent and Mersey Canal which runs just to the east of the lake.",
