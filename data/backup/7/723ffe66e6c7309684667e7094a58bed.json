  "description": "This Dorset town is a nice place to start a walk with extensive woodland and heathland to explore. It's also located close to the New Forest National Park and the Cranborne Chase AONB where there are numerous walking opportunities. This circular walk from the town takes you into the adjacent Verwood Forest, visiting the Stephen's Castle Nature Reserve and the Cranborne Common Nature Reserve. It's a pleasant place for walking or cycling, with a series of nice wide tracks to follow to the two reserves and across Boveridge Heath. At Stephen's Castle you'll find a short hill climb to a lovely viewpoint with views across the town and the surrounding countryside. There's also picturesque ponds, Bronze Age tumulus, peaceful woodland trails and pretty purple heather in the warmer months. Look out for various woodland birds and butterflies as you make your way through the wildlife rich area.",
