  "description": "This Dorset town is a nice place to start a walk with extensive woodland and heathland to explore. It's also located close to the New Forest National Park and the Cranborne Chase AONB where there are numerous walking opportunities. This circular walk from the town takes you into the adjacent Verwood Forest, visiting the Stephen's Castle Nature Reserve and the Cranborne Common Nature Reserve. It's a pleasant place for walking or cycling, with a series of nice wide tracks to follow to the two reserves and across Boveridge Heath. At Stephen's Castle you'll find a short hill climb to a lovely viewpoint with views across the town and the surrounding countryside. There's also picturesque ponds, Bronze Age tumulus, peaceful woodland trails and pretty purple heather in the warmer months. Look out for various woodland birds and butterflies as you make your way through the wildlife rich area.",

      "content": "The Monmouth Ash is a nice place for some rest and refreshment after your exercise. The historic pub includes a charming old interior with oak beans, open fires and flagstone floors. The pub\u2019s name, unique in Britain, commemorates the 1685 capture of the Duke of Monmouth (Charles II\u2019s illegitimate son) in Verwood, after the Monmouth Rebellion to overthrow James II was defeated. Legend has it that the Duke was captured after his clothes were found below an Ash tree. Monmouth was beheaded for treason on 15 July 1685. Many of his supporters were tried during the Bloody Assizes, led by Judge Jeffreys, and were condemned to death or transportation. James II was able to consolidate his power and reigned until 1688, when he was deposed by another nephew, William III of Orange, in the Glorious Revolution. They serve a delicious Sunday roast and have a nice big garden to relax in on warmer days. You can find the pub on Manor Road at postcode BH31 6DT for your sat navs."
