  "description": "Bempton Cliffs RSPB Nature Reserve is considered the best place in England to watch seabirds. Start species include Puffins, Gannets, Kittiwakes, Guillemots and Razorbills. In the summer months it is a spectacular sight with hundreds of thousands of birds around the cliffs. The RSPB have created several cliff-edge viewing platforms from which to observe the action. This walk starts at the reserve car park and heads along the coast in an easterly direction before turning back and heading west towards Buckton Cliffs. A lovely footpath then heads away from the coast and into the countryside towards Bempton. A country lane from Bempton then takes you back to the car park. As such the walk provides both great coastal scenery and views of the North York Moors countryside. You can easily continue your walk along the East Riding Heritage Way towards Thornwick Bay and the wonderful Flamborough Head .",
