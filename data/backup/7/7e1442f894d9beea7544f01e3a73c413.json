There's a nice woodland trail leading up to the hill summit where there are fine views over the city to be enjoyed. There's also a walled garden, a Cold War bunker and a 19th century tower to see. To continue your climbing in the city head up to the popular Arthur's Seat. The John Muir Way also runs across the hill. You could pick up this waymarked footpath to further explore the area.",
