  "description": "A lovely section of the Jurassic Coast between the Dorset villages of West Bay and Seatown. It's just over 3 miles and includes a substantial climb to Thorncombe Beacon and Doghouse Hill. The walk starts at the coastal village of West Bay with its attractive harbour and beautiful beach. The area is also known as Bridport Harbour, sited at the mouth of the River Brit approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south of the town of Bridport. From here you can pick up the coastal path and head west towards Eype Mouth where there is a beach and natural break in the line of sea cliffs. You then climb to Thorncombe Beacon where there are splendid views along the coast. The route continues west across Doghouse Hill before descending into Seatown. The pretty little hamlet includes views of the  River Winniford, little houses, and a small beach which is popular with fossil hunters. There's also a nice pub where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. West Bay sits at the western end of Chesil Beach. You can extend your walking in the area by heading east along the beach towards Weymouth and the Isle of Portland. Our Circular Walk from West Bay will take you to the nearby village of Burton Bradstock where there's another lovely beach. Just to the north you will find the climb to Colmers Hill near the picturesque village of Symondsbury. From here there's great views over this stretch of the coast and the rolling hills of Dorset and Devon. The pretty Symondsbury Estate is also a great place for refreshments with the excellent Symondsbury Kitchen, where there is a lovely garden to sit out in.",
