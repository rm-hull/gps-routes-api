  "description": "This circular walk explores the area surrounding the village of Llangrannog on the Ceredigion coast. It's a lovely place for a walk with an excellent beach and a splendid headland area to explore. You can also visit the valley of the River Hawen where you can see a waterfall near the centre of the village. The walk starts from the public car park in the village. You can then pick up a section of the Ceredigion Coast Path and follow it north east up to the wonderful promontory headland of Traeth-yr-ynys. From here dolphins and seals can be spotted in the waters below. There are also fabulous views over the blue waters of Cardigan Bay from here. The route then heads south west to climb to the Pendinas Lochtyn hillfort. This is a splendid example of a hillfort, with the enclosure itself being a very large 160m by 100m. You can climb to the top for more excellent views over the area. After enjoying the views the route descends back to the village via Lochtyn.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area follow the coast path south to visit the neighbouring village of Aberporth. The Aberporth to Llangrannog Coastal Path Walk and Aberporth Coastal Walk will take you to Tresaith and Penbryn with waterfalls and wonderful beaches to see on the way. Here you can also pick up the Aberporth to Mwnt Coastal Path and visit National Trust owned Mwnt beach. Cardigan is a little further west from there. Heading north will take you to New Quay where you can try the New Quay to Aberaeron Coastal Path. The town is notable as the residence of poet Dylan Thomas who lived there in 1944-45. In the town you can pick up the Dylan Thomas trail which visits local places associated with the poet. There's also the Aberaeron to Llanerchaeron Walk to pick up in this area. Also to the north is the Llangrannog to Cwmtydu Walk which takes you to the beautiful secluded cove at Cwmtydu. The beach is a great place to look out for seals during September and October."
