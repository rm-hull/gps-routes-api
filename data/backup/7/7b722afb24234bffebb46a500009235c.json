  "description": "This circular walk explores the area surrounding the village of Llangrannog on the Ceredigion coast. It's a lovely place for a walk with an excellent beach and a splendid headland area to explore. You can also visit the valley of the River Hawen where you can see a waterfall near the centre of the village. The walk starts from the public car park in the village. You can then pick up a section of the Ceredigion Coast Path and follow it north east up to the wonderful promontory headland of Traeth-yr-ynys. From here dolphins and seals can be spotted in the waters below. There are also fabulous views over the blue waters of Cardigan Bay from here. The route then heads south west to climb to the Pendinas Lochtyn hillfort. This is a splendid example of a hillfort, with the enclosure itself being a very large 160m by 100m. You can climb to the top for more excellent views over the area. After enjoying the views the route descends back to the village via Lochtyn.",
