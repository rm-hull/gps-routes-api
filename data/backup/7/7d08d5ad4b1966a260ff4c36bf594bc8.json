  "description": "This route visits the lovely Tarn Hows from the village of Hawkshead. It's about a 2 mile walk from the village, climbing to the Tarns on a mixture of country lanes and public footpaths. The walk starts in the centre of Hawkshead and follows Vicarage Lane out of the village. You then turn right to follow a footpath up to Keen Ground Wood and the hamlet of Hawkshead Hill. You then pass through the woodland of Hill Fell and the Sawrey Ground Plantation before coming to Tarn Hows. Here you'll find well surfaced tracks taking you around the tarn with some nice woodland trails as well. You can also climb to a lovely viewpoint at the south eastern end of the site.",
