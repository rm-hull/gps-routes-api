  "description": "This waterside cycling and walking trail follows the Water of Leith through Edinburgh. The route runs for just over 12 miles from Balerno to Leith along the small river. It's a nice flat path, ideal for cyclists looking for an easy ride, or walkers after an easy waterside stroll. Along the way there's lots of pretty waterfalls and weirs with wildlife such as herons to look out for. The access point for the start of the walk is at Balerno School on Bridge Road. You then follow the path in a north easterly direction, passing Currie, Juniper Green and Colinton Dell. Around here you will pass Redhall Mill and the accompanying mill cottages, with woodland and weirs to enjoy. Shortly after you will come to Slateford where you can explore The Water of Leith visitor centre. This is another good access point for the walk as there is a small car park and interesting exhibits about the walk in the centre. From here you pass under the aquaduct carrying the Union Canal and the viaduct carrying the railway. You continue through Saughton to Murrayfield where you will pass Murrayfield Stadium, home to Scottish rugby. The walk then heads through the delightful Dean Village. This area is one of the real highlights of the route, with some wonderful Georgian architecture and the Scottish National Galleries of Modern Art. The next stage takes you under the 19th century Telford Dean Bridge to St Bernard's Well, where there is a Roman temple-style folly and a statue of Hygeia, Goddess of Health. You continue to Stockbridge where you will find the lovely Royal Botanic Gardens. The garden's living collection consists of more than 13,302 plant species, whilst the herbarium contains in excess of 3 million preserved specimens. The final section takes you through Bonnington to the finish point at North Leith, near to the docks of the Port of Leath. If you would like to extend your walking in the area then the walking trails around Harlaw Reservoir and Threipmuir Reservoir in Balerno are good options. Around Slateford the river joins with the Union Canal which has a nice waterside walking and cycling trail.",
