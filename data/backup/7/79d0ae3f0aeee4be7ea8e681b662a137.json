  "description": "This marvellous attraction boasts 800 acres of beautiful parkland set in the Yorkshire countryside. Explore the beautiful landscaped Georgian water garden of Studley Royal, before heading to the fascinating 12th-century Fountains Abbey. Look out for beautiful statues, follies and the many resident deer in the deer park. The ancient corn mill, the 17th century Fountains Hall and the Victorian Gothic church are also well worth a look. The park is located just to the west of the North Yorkshire city of Ripon on the edge of the Nidderdale AONB. The Ripon Rowel long distance footpath passes the park so you can pick this up to extend your walking in the area. Heading south will take you through the countryside to Ingerthorpe and Markington. Just to the east you can pick up the towpath of the Ripon Canal and enjoy an easy walk to Newby Hall . The 18th century house is well worth a visit, with its splendid gardens and views over the River Ure.",
