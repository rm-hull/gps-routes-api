  "description": "This popular village in the Derbyshire Dales has a fascinating history and some lovely walks to try. Eyam is known as the 'Plague Village' because of an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1665. The villagers chose to isolate themselves rather than let the infection spread. This walk visits some of the interesting sites in the village including Eyam Hall, the 'Plague Cottages', the Parish Church and Eyam Moor. The walk starts from the National Trust car park in the centre of the village. From here you can visit the Jacobean style manor house of Eyam Hall. The hall dates from the 17th century and has attractive gardens to explore. You then head along Church Street and pass the so called 'Plague Cottages' where the first victims died. Soon after you come to the 14th century parish church of St Lawrence and the graveyard where the victims were buried. You can then head north out of the village, to Eyam Moor, passing the Plague Stone on the way. This is quite a challenging climb but with great views of the surrounding Peak District scenery from the high points. The moor is also home to Wet Withens stone circle.",
