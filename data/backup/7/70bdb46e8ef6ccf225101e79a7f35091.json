  "description": "This circular walk from Mortehoe visits Morte Point, Rockham Bay and Bull Point on the North Devon Coast. It's a lovely section of Exmoor coast with dramatic cliffs, beautiful countryside and pretty beaches. The area is managed by the National Trust so there are good footpaths and facilities in the area. The walk starts from the village of Mortehoe where there is a village car park. You follow a footpath through the countryside to Morte Point where there are some fascinating rock formations and great views towards Lundy Island. You then head east along the coast path to Bull Point, passing the lovely Rockham Bay and beach on the way. You should see lots of pretty wildlflowers in the summer along this stretch. Just after Bull Point you pick up an inland footpath which takes you back to the village. Here you can enjoy refreshments at the Smuggler's Rest pub. You could also visit the Mortehoe Musuem and learn about the interesting history of smuggling and shipwrecks in the area. It's easy to extend your walking in this lovely area by heading along the coast path to nearby Ilfracombe via Lee Bay. You could also visit the Woolacombe with its beautiful beaches and beyond that Baggy Point .",
