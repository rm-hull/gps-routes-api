  "description": "This walk takes you from Ambleside to the village of Troutbeck via Wansfell Pike. The route runs for about 2.5 miles so 5 miles there and back. The walk starts in the village and heads east to Stock Ghyll Force before climbing to Wansfell. The route then descends along Nanny Lane into Troutbeck where there's a fine old church and lovely views of the Troutbeck, the waterway after which the little village is named. For a longer circular walk see the video below.",
