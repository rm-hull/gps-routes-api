  "description": "This walk near Exeter explores the area around Dart's Farm in Devon. The farm centre is a popular place to visit with a wide variety of shops selling local produce and animals including alpacas, red ruby cattle and saddleback pigs. It's great for a walk too with a Sculpture Trail, a maize maze, a Farm Walk, a Nature Trail and a Bird Hide. The park includes a walking and cycling trail along the Exe Estuary which you can follow towards the Goosemoor Nature Reserve and Bowling Green Marsh. The area of marshland and wetland includes views of the River Clyst and a large variety of wildlife including avocets and egrets. This circular walk explores the estuary and the reserves with fine countryside views to enjoy on the way. Most of the route is suitable for cyclists too, with cycle hire available at the complex. To continue your walking in the area you could try the popular Topsham Goat Walk, a circular trail exploring Topsham Quay and the Bowling Green Marsh.",
