  "description": "This Berkshire based town is located in the Thames Valley near Reading and Windsor. Local walking highlights include the Slough Arm of the Grand Union Canal Walk which can be picked up at the Stoke Wharf canal basin on the eastern side of the town.  Just to the south there's more waterside walking along the Thames Path National Trail which can be picked up around Windsor and Eton. Other local highlights include Langley Park Country Park and Black Park Country Park where there are good woodland cycling trails and a popular Go Ape Tree top adventure course. This circular walk from the town takes you to some of the local highlights. The walk starts at Upton Court Park which is located on the south eastern side of the town. The town park has some nice footpaths with good views towards Windsor Castle. You'll then head south to Eton where you can enjoy a walk along the River Thames to Dorney Lake. The lake was used in the 2012 olympics and has some nice cycling and walking trails to follow around the site. The route then visits Dorney Court and Eton Wick village before picking up the Jubilee River for another waterside section. This will lead you back east towards Slough.",
