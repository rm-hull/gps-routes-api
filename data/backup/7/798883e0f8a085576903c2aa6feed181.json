      "caption": "Betty Kenny Tree at the site. Betty Kenny (Kate Kenyon) and her charcoal burner husband Luke lived during the late 1700's in this huge yew tree, reputed to be 2000 years old. Their house was formed within the tree, probably with a turf roof. They raised 8 children, and are said to have used a hollowed-out bough of the tree as a cradle. Local legend suggests that this is the origin of the nursery rhyme \"Rock-a-bye-Baby\". Groundwork Erewash Valley have developed the circular Betty Kenny Walk which visits this ancient relic."

  "description": "Enjoy waymarked walking trails through this peaceful woodland near Ambergate. In the spring you'll find carpets of bluebells. Wildlife includes warblers, flycatchers and bramblings. The woods are near to the Derwent Valley Heritage Way, so you could pick this up and follow the River Derwent to continue your walk. Our Around Belper circular walk makes use of this trail to take in the river and the nearby Cromford Canal. This is a walking route but the woods are also popular with mountain bike riders with a selection of trails to choose from. If you'd like to come by public transport then the train station at Ambergate is only about a mile south of the woods.",
