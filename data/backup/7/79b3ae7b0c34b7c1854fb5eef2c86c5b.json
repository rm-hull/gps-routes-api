  "description": "Enjoy peaceful cycling and walking trails in this popular forest in Northamptonshire. For cyclists there is a lovely, family cycle trail starting at the car park. It's a gentle circuit of the forest on surfaced paths but with a couple of road crossings to look out for. Walkers can enjoy three waymarked routes of varying lengths. The easy Elephant walk takes you past Elephant pond. For a longer walk you could try the 10km (6 mile) Woodpecker trail where you can look out for all three British species of woodpecker - the lesser spotted, greater spotted, and green. The forest has good facilities with parking spaces and a very good cafe. It is located about 7 miles south of Northampton. Several long distance cycling and walking trails run through or past the forest so it's easy to continue your exercise in the area. You could pick up the Hanslope Circular Ride, The Swan's Way or the Midshires Way to extend your outing.",

      "content": "The Milton Keynes Boundary Walk skirts the southern edge of the forest. You could pick up the waymarked circular trail and follow it east to visit the market town of Olney. There's some nice trails here along the River Great Ouse and around Emberton Lakes. A few miles to the north east there's the historic Castle Ashby to visit. Here you'll find a fine manor house surrounded by 35 acres of parkland including Italian Gardens, an Orangery, an Arboretum and a series of pretty ponds. The Northamptonshire Round long distance circular walk passes through the forest. It takes you on a tour of the countryside and villages of the area.
