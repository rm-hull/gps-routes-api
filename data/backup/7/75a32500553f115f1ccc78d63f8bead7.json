  "description": "This circular walk explores Redhill and Earlswood Commons in Surrey. The commons have miles of good footpaths taking you to ponds, lakes, woodland and grassland with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The walk starts at the car park at the southern end of Earlswood Common, off Woodhatch Road. You could also start from Earlswood train station which is very close to the commons. From the car park you head around Earlswood Lakes and north across the common to the little hamlet of St John's. It's a very pretty area with a Grade II listed church, a school and little cottages. After passing through St John's you come to Redhill Common where there's more footpaths to follow. The area is great for wildlife with various woodland birds, Roe deer, rabbits and foxes to see. The Greensand Way runs through Earlswood Common. You can easily pick up the long distance trail and head west to visit Priory Park and Reigate Heath. The two sites are located close to the common and offer up more good walking opportunites.",

There's some pleasant lakeside trails and lots of wildlife to see in this area. Bletchingley is also worth exploring with a conservation area including several historic medieval properties."
