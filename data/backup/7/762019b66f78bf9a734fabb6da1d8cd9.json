It runs for 14 miles from Loch Libo (395 feet above sea-level) in Uplawmoor, through Lugton and the parishes of Neilston, Beith, Dunlop, Stewarton and Kilwinning. The Lugton joins the Garnock below the tidal limit, shortly after passing through Eglinton Country Park. The Bungle Burn, an outflow of the Blae Loch, joins the Lugton Water near the Bungleburn Bridge outside the village of Burnhouse. It contains fresh-water and sea-trout and the occasional salmon."
