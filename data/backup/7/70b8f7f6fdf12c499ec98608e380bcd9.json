  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir in the Peak District. There's a nice footpath running around the lake with fine views along the way. The walk starts from the little village of Tintwistle which is located just to the north of the water. From here you can pick up the Etherow Goyt Valley Way and following along the reservoir. It's about a 1.5 mile walk around the perimeter so it should take around 30-45 minutes. On the way there's fine views across the water to the surrounding woodland, hills and countryside. The Longdendale Trail runs past the southern end of the reservoir. This shared cycling and walking trail is a great way to extend your outing. You could follow it east and visit Valehouse and Torside Reservoir .",
