Trees have been growing in Blakes Wood for 10.000 years, since the last ice age. The site has been managed by man for many centuries using the technique of coppicing - cutting trees to the ground and then allowing them to regrow in following years. Traditionally this process provided a regular supply of timber for fences and firewood, but is now recognised as also being beneficial for wildlife by encouraging woodland flowers and providing an ideal habitat for insects and birds."

    "description": "This pretty little village is located near to Chelmsford in Essex. It's very close to a number of fine riverside, country and woodland trails making a nice spot to start a walk. This circular walk from the village visits some of the local highlights including Little Baddow Hall, the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation, Paper Mill Lock and the National Trust's Blake's Wood. The walk starts in the village centre and heads west along Holybread Lane to Little Baddow Hall. The attractive timber-framed hall, dates back to the 14th-15th century, and stands directly opposite the parish church of St Mary the Virgin. The route then heads north from the hall to meet up with the River Chelmer and follow a footpath east to Paper Mill Lock. It's a popular place for a walk with the picturesque lock and the adjacent Paper Mill tea rooms for refreshment. You continue east along the waterside path before turning south to Tofts, passing Bassett's Wood and Scrub Wood. The route then passes through the village to explore Blake's Wood to the south west. There's a number of trails here with oak, hornbeam and sweet chestnut trees and bluebells in the spring. You can also look out for a variety of woodland birds here. After exploring the woods the route then reutrns to the village.",
