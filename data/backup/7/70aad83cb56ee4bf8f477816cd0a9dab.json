  "description": "This circular walk visits a tranquil nature reserve and lake in the Cambrian Mountains of Wales. There's a nice circular trail running around the small lake with wonderful views over the water to the surrounding mountains. You can start the walk on the eastern side of the water where there is a car park and an information board with details on the flora and fauna at the site. In particular look out for the pretty heather in the late summer. Some of the path can be quite boggy so you may need good waterproof boots to do the whole circuit. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the Cambrian Way and follow the waymarked footpath south to Plynlimon, the highest point in the Cambrian Mountains. The long distance Glyndwr's Way also passes to the north of the lake.",
