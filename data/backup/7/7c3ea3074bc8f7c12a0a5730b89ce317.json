  "description": "This walk climbs to the excellent viewpoint on Cadair Ifan Goch in the Conwy Valley just north of Llanrwst, North Wales. The walk starts from the National Trust car park located at Maenan, just to the south of the hill. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north west through woodland to the 207 metres (679 ft) high summit. From here there are wonderful views across the river valley to the Carneddau mountains in the distance. Just to the west, on the other side of the river, you can continue your outing on the Dolgarrog Pipeline Walk. This explores the area around the little village, visiting the impressive pipeline structure and the Coedty reservoir. Near here there's also the beautiful Llyn Eigiau where the reservoir dam was breached leading to the Dolgarrog Dam disaster of 1925.",
