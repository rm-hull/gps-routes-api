  "description": "This Lincolnshire based town is located in the West Lindsey district of the county. There are miles of good country footpaths and some fine woodland trails to try in the area. This circular walk takes you from the town to Willingham Woods and the nearby village of Tealby. There's some lovely Lincolnshire Wolds scenery and historic buildings to see on the way. The walk starts on the eastern side of the town just north of the train station. From here you can pick up trails heading east into the woods. There's lots of trails here which are great for walking or cycling. Look out for deer and various woodland birds as you make your way through the woods. After leaving the woods you pick up the footpath heading north east along the River Rase to Tealby. The attractive village includes a noteworthy 12th century church and a thatched pub dating back to the 14th century. Here you can pick up a section of the Viking Way and follow the waymarked trail north west to Walesby. This small village includes a church known as the \"Ramblers Church\" as it features a 1951 stained glass window detailing walkers and cyclists. The route then heads west from Walesby before turning south to follow bridleways back to Market Rasen.",
