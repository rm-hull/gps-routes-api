      "caption": "The Aviary is contemporary with the manor house, certainly being in place by 1889. Possibly inspired by an aviary at his childhood home, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild envisaged the Waddesdon Manor aviary as a focal point in the gardens. During house parties hosted by the Baron the collection of exotic birds was brought out and the Baron and his guests fed them by hand. Nowadays the aviary serves a scientific purpose in breeding some endangered species. The statue in the formal garden is of Apollo and a goat."

  "description": "Explore the beautiful grounds surrounding this exquisite French Renaissance-style chateau near Aylesbury. Walking trails take you through woodland, Victorian style gardens, a parterre with ornate fountains and a working aviary with adjacent rose garden. There are also splendid views of the surrounding Oxfordshire countryside, the Chilterns Hills and the Vale of Aylesbury. Built in the style of a French chateau between 1874 and 1889 for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild the house is also well worth a visit. In the tour you will see grand rooms and over 15,000 works of art, including 18th-century portraits by British artists Reynolds, Gainsborough and Romney. A number of walking trails run past the house including the Bernwood Jubilee Way , Aylesbury Ring , Midshires Way , and the Tramway Trail . These all offer great opportunities for exploring the Buckinghamshire countryside surrounding the park. In September 2018 a new shared cycling and walking trail opened which links Aylesbury Vale Parkway Station to the site. The Waddesdon Greenway runs for about 4km on a nice surfaced path and is a great way to visit the manor if you're coming by public transport.",
