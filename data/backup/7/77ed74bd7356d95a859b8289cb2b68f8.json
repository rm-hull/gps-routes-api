  "description": "Climb to this prominent landmark and scheduled ancient monument on this walk in Huddersfield. At the top of the hill you will find and Iron Age Hillfort and the grade II listed Victoria Tower. The tower is 106 feet (32.3 m) high, making the hill over 1000 ft high. From the summit there are fantastic views over the town and the surrounding countryside of the Holme Valley. You can start the walk from the car park located at the top of the hill or from the nearby Berry Brow Train Station, if you wish to visit by public transport. You can follow the Holme Valley Circular Walk from the station to the hill which is about a 1 mile climb to the east. Then you can follow a series of good surfaced footpaths around the hilltop. At the summit you will find the fascinating remains of an early Iron Age Hillfort and a 12th century motte and bailey castle. It is also the site of a deserted medieval village. To extend your walk follow the Holme Valley Circular Walk south to Farnley Tyas, via Molly Carr Wood and Royd House Wood. If you head west the path will take you through Berry Brow to Armitage Bridge. Here you can enjoy a walk along the River Holme through Mag Wood. You can see the fantastic view from the elevated car park on the google street view link below! It shows the wonderful panoramic view of the Kirklees countryside.",
