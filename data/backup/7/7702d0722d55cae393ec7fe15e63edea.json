  "description": "Starting from the Shaw's Bridge car park follow the Lagan towpath along the river Lagan on this lovely walk in Belfast. In the park there are a variety of habitats including wet meadows, ponds, mixed beech woodland and attractive parkland. The towpath makes for a nice, easy waterside cycle or walk. You can extend your exercise by continuing along the Lagan Towpath to Lisburn. Also nearby is the pretty Belvoir Park Forest. The woods have a number of waymarked trails to try with lots of woodland wildlife to look out for. You're also very close to the splendid Lady Dixon Park which includes more nice footpaths taking you to the arboretum, the Azalea Walk, fountains, a walled garden and a delightful a Japanese-style garden with pretty water features.",
