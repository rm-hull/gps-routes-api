  "description": "This circular walk on the Cornish coast visits Stepper Point near Padstow. It's a lovely section of the South West Coast Path passing around the headland with great sea views, attractive countryside with lots of flora and fauna, interesting rock formations and nice sandy beaches. This walk starts at the car park at Trevone Bay but you can just as easily start from Padstow. Trevone Bay has a popular beach, a good cafe and car park so is a nice place to start your hike to Stepper Point. You can pick up the coastal path north, running past Gunver Head and Longcarrow Cove to Stepper Point. Here you will pass the Daymark Tower which dates from the 19th century. It was used as a navigational aid, designed to guide sailors into the River Camel. The route then turns south towards Padstow with great views over the Doom Bar at the mouth of the Camel Estuary. You continue along the estuary to St Saviour's Point before coming to Padstow where you can enjoy a stroll through the town and stop for refreshments. You could also visit Prideaux Place where you can enjoy a walk through the attractive grounds and deer park surrounding the 16th century house. The final section of the walk takes you through the countryside around Trethilick before returning to Trevone Bay. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Camel Trail or Saints Way which both pass Padstow. Continuing west along the South West Coast Path will take you towards Harlyn, Mother Ivy's Bay and Trevose Head .",
