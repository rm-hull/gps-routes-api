  "description": "This lovely country park in Macclesfield has splendid views of the Peak District National Park and the Cheshire plain.  You can also see Macclesfield Forest, the summit of Shutlingsloe (the second highest point in Cheshire), the Telecoms Tower on Sutton Common and the Macclesfield Canal. This circular walk starts at the car park at the northern end of the park and heads south to the viewpoints. At the southern end you'll descend to Teggsnose Wood, Tegg's Nose Reservoir and Bottoms Reservoir. There's some nice waterside trails to try here before returning to the car park on other footpaths on the eastern side of the park. The landscape includes meadow, moorland and woodland while there is also a waterside section aroung Tegg's Nose Reservoir. The park has a very good Visitors Centre where you can find out details of the cycle and walking routes in the park. Click here to see the Tegg's Nose to Parkgate cycle route details. The Gritstone Trail walking route also runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk. Macclesfield Forest and Trentabank Reservoir lie just to the east where you will find more good walking trails.",
