  "description": "Enjoy 2000 acres of cycling and walking trails in this large country park in Bolton. The parkland surrounds the Grade 1-listed Smithills Hall with a history dating back to the 14th century. Smithills includes lakes, woodland, farmland and moorland with superb views of the West Pennine Moors. If you head south west of the park you could extend your walking in Moss Bank Park and the Doffcocker Lodge Nature Reserve. There's some nice woodland trails and a pretty lake to explore here. The Bolton Walk explores the lovely Queen's Park in the town centre, near to the train station.",
