However, some notable incidents include the wreck of the Naryana in 1886 off Coney Island. Her full nameplate hangs in MJ Ward's Bar, while a photo of her captain and her ship's lifeboat nameplate can be seen in Austie's. The SS Sligo, wrecked in 1912 near Ardbowline, has its anchor mounted close to her captain's house near the end of the village. In 1925, the Diamantis Pateris was wrecked near the village with 5000 tons of maize aboard. Interesting pictures of this incident can be found in Harry's Bar, and her Captain's Table is displayed proudly in the front bar of Austie's."

Elsinore House, later owned by Henry Middleton, was originally constructed by John Black, also known as \"Black Jack,\" who was reputed to be a skilled smuggler and pirate. An investigation into the activities of an armed gang of smugglers in Rosses Point took place in the early 1800s. Eventually, authorities seized Elsinore, \"Black Jack's\" splendid residence, in recognition of his illicit endeavours."

He'll have to be buried.\" And so they did just that. They laid the sailor to rest in a shallow grave on the headland, placing a loaf of bread and a shovel beside him in case he should awaken. And thus, Deadman's Point acquired its name."

      "caption": "Bomore Point. The area has a rich history of producing sailors and sea captains who traversed the globe. Among its notable figures is the Petty Officer stationed on The Perch Rock since 1821, famously known as our Metal Man. Positioned strategically, when ships align his light with the Oyster Island light in the backdrop, they ensure they are on the correct course home. As ships approach, his outstretched arm indicates the deep channel. Designed by Thomas Kirk, who also created Nelson's Statue once atop a pillar in Dublin and the three statues adorning the GPO, the Metal Man serves as a crucial navigational aid. Pilots maintained a constant lookout for incoming ships, often from watch houses. The oldest of these houses stands along the scenic walk. Within its walls, WB Yeats once listened to seafarers recount tales of distant lands and local folklore involving ghosts and fairies. This watch house along the scenic walk was later replaced by one near the 1st Tee on the Golf Course. Today, the VHF radio has supplanted the need for prolonged night watches."

      "caption": "A quiet moment with Yeats on Rosses Point. Rosses Point has historically served as a wellspring of inspiration for artists, poets, and musicians, a tradition that endures to this day. Perhaps its most renowned association is with the Yeats family. Deeply involved in Sligo's maritime trade, the extended Yeats clan found solace and creative fuel in the village, influencing the works of WB Yeats and the paintings of Jack Yeats. Elsinore, once owned by their Great Uncle William Middleton, played a central role in their lives. The Middleton lodges, Bowmore and Moyle, were frequented by the extended family, with Moyle Lodge hosting WB during the summer of 1887. It was here that WB penned the story poem \"The Wanderings of Oisin.\" While the significance of the Yeatsian connection to the village may not have received adequate attention, exploring WB's writings offers a glimpse into the village's past, while Jack's paintings capture its essence. Embark on the coastal walk and delve deeper into this rich history through interpretive panels along the way."
