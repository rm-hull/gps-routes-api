  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll around this park and nature reserve in Halesowen near Birmingham. The park covers 141 acres and has well laid out, surfaced footpaths to follow. The park has many very pretty features with woodland, grassland, streams, waterfalls and large ponds which attract a variety of wildlife. Look out for dragonflies, toads, kingfisher and newts in the wetland areas and woodpeckers, tawny owls and badgers in the woodland. The park has an interesting history having been designed by the poet William Shenstone between 1743 and 1763. The Leasowes is considered to be one of the first natural landscape gardens in England. As such it is one of the most significant parks in the country. The Monarch's Way long distance footpath runs past the park so you can pick this up to extend your walk. If you follow it north you'll pass along the Dudley Canal to Mucklow Hill and Blackheath. Head south and you will soon come to the atmospheric remains of Halesowen Abbey. The abbey is owned by English Heritage and was originally founded in 1215 under a grant from King John of England. Also nearby is the lovely Woodgate Valley Country Park . The park is located just a couple of miles to the east. It contains 450 acres of rich meadows, woodland and small ponds with the Bourn brook running through the heart of the park.",
