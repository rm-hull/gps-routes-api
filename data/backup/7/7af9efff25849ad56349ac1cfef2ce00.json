  "description": "This walk visits the Foulshaw Moss Nature Reserve near Witherslack in Cumbria. At the reserve you can follow waymarked trails along a series of boardwalks over the Lowland raised bog. On the way you can see several interesting species of plant and flower. It's also great for bird watching with nesting ospreys, hobby, sparrowhawk, buzzard and peregrine to look out for from the hides. The peaceful site also has some facilities with a small car park and toilets. To continue your walking in the area head a short distance north to explore the Whitbarrow National Nature Reserve. The reserve includes wonderful limestone scenery and challenging hill climbs with excellent views over the area. You can also pick up the epic Cumbria Coastal Way on the eastern side of the reserve. Following it west would take you to Grange-over-Sands where you can enjoy a climb to Hampsfell Hospice .",

      "content": "A few miles to the north there's another local geological highlight at Beetham's Fairy Steps. Here you will find an unusual natural limestone staircase which you can climb for more excellent views. The little village of Beetham is also well worth exploring with its 14th century ruined manor house and a particularly lovely garden centre. Just to the east there's the nearby market town of Milnthorpe. Here you can enjoy a lovely walk along Milnthorpe Sands to the River Kent Estuary and the wonderful topiary at Levens Hall."
