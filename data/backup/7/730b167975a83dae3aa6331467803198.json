  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle through this large country park in Havering in the Ingrebourne Valley. Features in the park include the River Ingrebourne, grassland, a fishing lake and woodland paths. The park is also a Local Nature Reserve with marshes containing the largest freshwater reed bed in London. As such it is a great area for birdwatching and wildlife spotting. The park is also the site of the former RAF Hornchurch base\u00a0which was used in the First and Second World Wars. As such there are some historical features including an aircraft dispersal bay, pillboxes, and Tett turrets. The Ingrebourne Valley walking and cycle route runs through the park so you could pick this up and head towards Rainham or Upminster to continue your outing. Just to the east there's also the noteworthy Belhus Woods Country Park where you'll find lakes, wildflower meadows and bluebell woodland.",
