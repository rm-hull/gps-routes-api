  "description": "This circular walk around Pembury takes you through some of the woodland to the north of the village before picking up a waymarked trail to explore the countryside. The fairly easy route runs for just over 5 miles, visiting farmland, orchards, peaceful woods and a nice farm shop on the way. The route starts in the village and heads north to Marshleyharbour Wood and Forest Wood before picking up the Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk at Downingbury. This waymarked footpath takes you south through Snipe Wood to Romford and Henwood Green. You'll then pass through the farmland to the south of Pembury before turning north to return to the village. To continue your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Tunbridge Wells Common or pick up the long distance High Weald Landscape Trail to further explore the lovely High Weald AONB. Also nearby is the splendid Dunorlan Park where you'll find wide lawns, waterside paths along the large lake, attractive woodland and a Grecian Temple containing the Dancing Girl Statue.",
