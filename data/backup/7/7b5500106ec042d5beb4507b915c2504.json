  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the Cat's Back, a wonderful ridge on Black Hill in the Black Mountains region of the Brecon Beacons. The walk starts from the Black Hill car park in the Olchon Valley, just west of Michaelchurch Escley. From here you can pick up a walking trail heading up on to the ridge. Follow the trail north west and it will take you up onto Black Hill which stands at a height of 640 metres or 2100 feet. The rocky knife-edge ridge gives excellent views into Wales on one side, and England on the other. The route then descends to the north west, passing Crib y Garth before linking up with the Offa's Dyke Path National Trail. Follow the waymarked footpath south east before turning east to cross the Olchon Brook and return to the car park. Additionally, the area is excellent for wildlife spotting with Red Kites and the lovely Welsh Mountain pony commonly spotted around the ridge. Also keep your eyes peeled for common buzzard,\u00a0kestrel,\u00a0carrion crow,\u00a0common raven\u00a0and\u00a0skylark as you make your way along the ridge.",
