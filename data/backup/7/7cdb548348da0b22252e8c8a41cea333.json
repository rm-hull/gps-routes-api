The house sits at the head of a wooded gill tangled with rhododendrons, which descends to the Longford Stream. It was built in 1560 for iron master, but was extended greatly in the 18th century. It was once the home of William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford. The Grade II* listed building was a country hotel, but is now a private house."

Yellowhammers enjoy the bushy stream sides, while pied wagtails like the gravels and clay banks, and grey wagtails can be seen in the weirs and pond bays."
