  "description": "This short walk visits Southfield Reservoir near Doncaster and Goole. You can start the walk at the roadside parking on Oak Lane, just to the east of the reservoir at Beevers bridge. From here you can pick up a nice waterside track running along the Aire and Calder Navigation to the reservoirs. There's a fishing, windsurfing and some lovely country views to enjoy as well. Just to the west of the reservoir you can pick up the Trans Pennine Trail. If you follow the trail north it will take you towards Snaith and West Cowick. The village of Pollington lies just to the west.",
