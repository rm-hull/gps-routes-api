  "description": "This West Midlands based village includes a train station, a good 17th century village pub and a pleasant local nature reserve for easy walks. This circular walk from the village takes you to the Marsh Lane Nature Reserve and Barston Lakes. You can start the walk at the train station and head east to Patrick Farm. Here you turn south to visit the reserve and the pretty lake where you can see various water loving birds on the water. The site also includes feeding stations which attract a variety of species including Nuthatch and Great Spotted Woodpecker. Birds of prey such as osprey and buzzards have also been sighted at the reserve. In the area there are nice views of the River Blythe which runs along the western side of the reserve. Head west from the reserve and you can visit the pretty Ryton Lake before heading north to return to the village.",
