The barely perceptible summit on the bracken-infested moor left of the wall is West Hare Crag.

Although it starts off with \"the ugliest mile on the walk\", the scenery improves considerably north of the watershed, passing Goldsborough and then dropping down to this point where there are more choices of possible route before meeting the western variant at the head of Blackton reservoir."

In winter (as seen here) the ground may be well-frozen and give firm footing - it is rarely steep enough for a fall."

The south end car park is very open to scrutiny by water company staff which may be an issue for some paddlers depending on intentions. The River needs a lot more water in it than this to be paddled, and trees can be a significant hazard. Most of the flow is coming from the tailrace somewhat hidden behind the grassy bank to the right of the picture, with only a small amount coming down the spillway. The spillway itself has seen descents by canoeists, but the authorities do not really approve. If there is enough water to paddle the river, the spillway is likely to be very fast with a significant impact and stopper at the bottom - canoe descents seem to have mostly been done in a low level such as seen here, at which level the river will not really \"go\"."

You can climb to the pike on a circular walk by using trails heading north from the village and using part of the Pennine Way.
