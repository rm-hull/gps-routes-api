      "caption": "Pencelli Bridge. The Great Western Railway notice on the parapet of the bridge is a reminder that prior to nationalisation in 1948 the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal was owned by that company. This was not unusual; many canals were acquired by railway companies who were not generally interested in developing canal traffic, seeing it as unwelcome competition to the core business. This was certainly the case on this canal where commercial traffic ceased in the early years of the 20th century, although the canal had to be maintained as a water feed for Newport Docks. The notice itself, couched in archaic legal terms, warns that the bridge is not sufficiently strong to carry exceptional loads; it was probably never intended to act as a road sign, more in the nature of a legal disclaimer."

  "description": "This waterside walk takes you along the opening section of the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal , from Brecon to the village of Talybont On Usk . The route runs for just over 7 miles on the flat canal towpath, passing a series of aqueducts, old bridges, marinas and weirs. The walk starts from the canal basin in Brecon and heads east towards the Brynich Aqueduct which carries the canal over the River Usk.  The route turns south here, taking you to Storehouse Bridge where there's a marina and another aqueduct. The final section runs from Pencelli into Talybont-on-Usk. The small village has a shop and several pubs for refreshments after your walk. You can extend the walk by continuing south to Talybont Reservoir . The Taff Trail runs along the eastern side of the water. There are splendid views over the water to the surrounding hills and beautiful waterfalls near Abercynafon at the southern end of the reservoir.\u00a0Another walk can be followed along the line of the former\u00a0Brinore Tramroad\u00a0which runs south from the canalside wharf in the village around the western flanks of Y Wenallt and Tor Y Foel .",
