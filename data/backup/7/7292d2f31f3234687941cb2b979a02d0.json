  "description": "This circular walk visits the lovely Wigg Island park between Runcorn and Widnes in Cheshire. The park sits in an interesting location, between the\u00a0River Mersey\u00a0and the Manchester Ship Canal . The area is also deisgnated as a local nature reserve so is popular with local birdwatchers. It is named after\u00a0Charles Wigg, who started an alkali works there in the 1860s to extract\u00a0copper\u00a0from its\u00a0ore. You can start the walk from the car park and visitor centre at the western end of the site. Then pick up a circular trail heading around the island for just over 3 miles.",
