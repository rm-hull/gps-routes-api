      "caption": "A lovely summer view of the lake in 2007. The reservoir was created by the construction of a dam across the River Brent which was built between 1833 and 1835, and extended in 1854, in order to provide water for the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal. The Grand Union Canal, and their successors, British Waterways, owned or own the reservoir, which has also been known as the Kingsbury Reservoir and the Welsh Harp Reservoir in the past. This is the northern section, viewed from Cool Oak Bridge, and is fed by the Silk Stream."

The Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale mapping shows a sea of dark green here as the A406 North Circular Road and the A41 Hendon Way meet at the Brent Cross Flyover, so you'll have to take my word for it that this is where the river is too. A small weir impounds a head of water as the river flows down towards the reservoir."

  "description": "Brent Reservoir and the Wesh Harp Open space space is a popular place for walkers and cyclists. A traffic free path runs long the northern shore of this large lake with views across the water and woodland trails. It's a fine place for bird watching with two bird hides and visitors which include great crested grebe, gadwall, shoveler, common pochard, tufted duck and common tern.  There's also the Welsh Harp Environmental Education Centre which is a 15 acre woodland site where children can have a hands-on experience with nature. If you'd like to extend your walk you could pick up the Capital Ring walking route and follow it west to the nearby Fryent Country Park .",
