  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the scenic Lough Talt in Country Sligo. You can start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the lake. You can then follow a lovely lakeside path along the western side of the water before returning along the road if you wish. The route runs for about 5.5km with wonderful views over the lough to the surrounding hills. There's also lots of wildlife with swans, ducks and\u00a0dippers to look out for on the way. To continue your walking in the area you could head west to visit the expansive Lough Conn . Here you can visit the atmospheric remains of the ancient Errew Abbey. The Sligo Way long distance trail also starts from the northern end of the lake."
