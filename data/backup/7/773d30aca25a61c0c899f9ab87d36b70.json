  "description": "This pretty Derbyshire Dales village is surrounded by some beautiful countryside. The village also includes the picturesque Bentley Brook and some quaint old buildings. This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights of the area including Tissington Hall, Dovedale Stepping Stones and Thorpe Cloud. The walk could also be extended by visiting the splendid Ilam Park which lies just to the west. The walk starts by the old church in the village and heads west to link up with the Tissington Trail. You can follow this shared cycling and walking rail trail north to visit the neighbouring village of Tissington and Tissington Hall. The 17th-century Jacobean mansion house is surrounded by some lovely terraces and gardens. It is open to the public on certain days of the year. The route then picks up a section of the Limestone Way and follows the waymarked trail south to Thorpe. From here you can climb to the wonderful viewpoint at Thorpe Cloud before descending to visit the iconic stepping stones in Dovedale. The walk then returns to Thorpe before heading east to return to Fenny Bentley.",
