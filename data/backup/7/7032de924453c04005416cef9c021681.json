The path is named after the Bateman family who once owned Biddulph Grange and, possibly in particular, James Bateman who designed and created the famous gardens attached to the Grange."

    "description": "This circular walk runs for a distance of about 2 miles on a series of well laid out footpaths in this lovely country park in Biddulph. The 73 acre park includes woodland trails, open meadows and a lake. After your walk head to the visitor centre where you can enjoy refreshments in the cafe. There's also beautiful National Trust gardens which take you on a global journey from Italy to the pyramids of Egypt, a Victorian vision of China and a re-creation of a Himalayan glen. The Staffordshire Moorlands Walks long distance trail runs through the park so there is scope for extending your walk. You could follow the waymarked footpath south to Greenway Bank and Knypersley Reservoir. The park has some nice footpaths taking you to quiet woodland, a lovely waterfall and the Serpentine Pool. There's also the Biddulph Valley Way to try. This shared cycling and walking path takes you to Congleton on a disused railway track.",
