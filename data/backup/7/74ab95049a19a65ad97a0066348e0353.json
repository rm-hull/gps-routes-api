  "description": "This walk visits the Eastwell Park Estate in Boughton Lees in Kent. The ancient estate includes a 14th century church, attractive parkland, the photogenic Eastwell Towers, a prety lake and the fine stately home which is now operated as a country house hotel. The estate is located just north of Ashford in Kent. You can park at the car park next to the church at the northern end of Eastwell Lake. The ruined 14th century church contains a memorial commemorating the grave of Richard Plantagenet, alleged to be the illegitimate son of Richard III. He worked as a bricklayer on the original country house during the 16th century. From here you can follow a surfaced section of the North Downs Way with views over the water. Follow the trail east and it will take you to Broughton Lees village where you can enjoy some refreshments. You'll also pass the grand Eastwell Manor Hotel where you could enjoy an afternoon tea before a stroll around the lovely gardens. The house is notable as a former royal residence having been occupied by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria.",
