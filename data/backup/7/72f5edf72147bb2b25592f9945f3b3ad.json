  "description": "Explore woodland, heathland and ponds on this walk on Woolbeding Common near Chichester in West Sussex. The area is managed by the National Trust so there are good footpaths and a car park off Older Hill Lane. There's miles of good tracks to follow with the area also including Oakham Common, Pound Common, Stedham Marsh and the hamlet of Titty Hill. If you follow the trails south from the common you will soon come to the beautiful River Rother Valley. Here you can enjoy a stroll along the river and visit Iping Common and Stedham Common. Two long distance footpaths also pass through the common. You can pick up either the Serpent Trail or the New Lipchis Way to extend your walk. Heading north will take you towards Older Hill, Stanley Common and Liphook. Woolbeding Common is located a few miles north west of Midhurst where you can pick up the Midhurst Way .",
