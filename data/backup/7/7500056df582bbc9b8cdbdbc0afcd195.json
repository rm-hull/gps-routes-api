      "caption": "Moira Furnace, one of the highlights of the trail. Moira Furnace, with its ramp over the Ashby Canal, was Built by Francis Rawdon Hastings in 1804. Intending to exploit local minerals to smelt iron, it failed within months and was soon colonised by locals in need of housing. The building was used in this way right through to the early 1970's when it was earmarked for demolition. Thankfully it was saved and now is a jewel in Britain's industrial heritage."

The path passes old Donisthorpe Colliery site, which is now a Woodland Park and Conkers - a forest-based attraction with a number of activities to enjoy. The trail includes a pleasant waterside section along the Ashby Canal .",

      "content": "In Moira there's the splendid Moira Furnace to visit. There's a fine country park here with woodland and parkland trails surrounding the early 19th century iron furnace. There's also a museum featuring lime kilns and craft workshops. Here you can learn all about Moira's significant part in the industrial revolution. The woods, ponds and mountain bike trails of Hicks Lodge are also located near here and well worth exploring. Just to the south east you'll find more woodland trails and a series of pretty lakes at Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Wood and Sence Valley Forest Park on the outskirts of Coalville. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks page."
