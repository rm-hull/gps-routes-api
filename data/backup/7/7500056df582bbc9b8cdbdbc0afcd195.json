Intending to exploit local minerals to smelt iron, it failed within months and was soon colonised by locals in need of housing. The building was used in this way right through to the early 1970's when it was earmarked for demolition. Thankfully it was saved and now is a jewel in Britain's industrial heritage."

  "description": "This lovely short cycle and walking trail runs from Measham near Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Moira along a disused railway path. The path passes old Donisthorpe Colliery site, which is now a Woodland Park and Conkers - a forest-based attraction with a number of activities to enjoy. The trail includes a pleasant waterside section along the Ashby Canal .",
