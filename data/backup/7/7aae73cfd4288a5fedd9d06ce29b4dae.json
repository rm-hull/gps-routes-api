  "description": "The small market town of Brampton is located in the Carlisle\u00a0district of\u00a0Cumbria. There's a fine local country park and some peaceful woods to visit in the area. The town is also not far from Hadrian's Wall where there are excellent walking opportunities. Buildings of note in the town include the\u00a0octagonal\u00a0Moot Hall, which is in the centre of Brampton. It was built in 1817 by the\u00a0Earl of Carlisle and now\u00a0houses the\u00a0Tourist Information Centre. Much of the town consists of historic buildings built of the local red sandstone. In 2011, Brampton became the 66th town in the United Kingdom and the second in Cumbria to gain\u00a0Walkers are Welcome status. This circular walk from the train station visits two of the highlights of the area at Talkin Tarn Country Park and Gelt Woods . It's a lovely varied walk with lakeside paths, woodland trails and river views to enjoy. The walk starts from Brampton train station just to the south east of the town centre. The station can be reached from Carlisle & Newcastle. From here you can pick up country lanes and footpaths heading south west towards Talkin Tarn where there is a country park with good facilities and lovely views. Follow the trails south along the tarn and you will come to the village of Talkin. From Talkin head west along a country lane and it will take you to the River Gelt where you can follow a footpath north through Gelt Woods. There's lots of peaceful woodland trails here with an interesting Roman inscribed rock to see as well. After passing through the woods you can follow footpaths north east and then east to return to the train station.",
