  "description": "This walk takes you along the South West Coast Path from Porthleven to Praa Sands. The walk runs for just over 4 miles, passing along a cliff top path with wonderful views throughout. Also look out for the ruined mines of Wheal Trewavas and Wheal Prosper as you approach Praa Sands. You start off at the lovely Porthleven Harbour and head west to Bullion Cliff, Tremearne, Trewavas Head and Porthcew before coming to Praa Sands. Here you will find a beautiful mile long white sands beach, sand dunes and a little village. It's a popular place for surfers, tourists and walkers. You can extend the walk by continuing west to visit Prussia Cove and Cudden Point on the Praa Sands to Prussia Cove Walk .  It's a delightful secluded place with a series of little coves and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) with fascinating geology and some rare butterfly species.",
