  "description": "This pretty reservoir in Ripponden has nice footpaths climbing above the water. You can park at the Booth Wood Reservoir car park at the eastern end of the water, off Oldham Road. Then follow the public footpath above the reservoir's northern side, taking you through some nice Calderdale countryside. The path runs west, passing Rishworth Lodge and then down to the water. You could continue west to visit Green Withens Reservoir and then climb to the wonderful viewpoint on Blackstone Edge. Booth Wood is located just to the south of Rishworth and Ripponden. To continue your waterside walking you can visit the nearby Scammonden Reservoir, Deanhead Reservoir, Ryburn Reservoir and Baitings Reservoir .",
