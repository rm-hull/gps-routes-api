  "description": "This pretty reservoir in Ripponden has nice footpaths climbing above the water. You can park at the Booth Wood Reservoir car park at the eastern end of the water, off Oldham Road. Then follow the public footpath above the reservoir's northern side, taking you through some nice Calderdale countryside. The path runs west, passing Rishworth Lodge and then down to the water. You could continue west to visit Green Withens Reservoir and then climb to the wonderful viewpoint on Blackstone Edge. Booth Wood is located just to the south of Rishworth and Ripponden. To continue your waterside walking you can visit the nearby Scammonden Reservoir, Deanhead Reservoir, Ryburn Reservoir and Baitings Reservoir .",

      "content": "There's a couple of fantastic old pubs with great views to the west of the reservoir. The White House is located next to Blackstone Edge Reservoir and an inn of some note. The remote pub is in a fabulous location in an elevated position on the Halifax Road with panoramic views of the surrounding moors and Hollingworth Lake far below. It also has a wonderful history being originally an old coaching house dating from 1671. It is situated 1,300 feet above sea level and includes an outdoor seating area where you can relax on warmer days. The pub has an extensive menu and a nice cosy interior. You can find it at postcode OL15 0LG for your sat navs. Just up the road is the Moorcock Inn, located at the foot of the Pennines in Littleborough. There's more great countryside views from the garden area with home-made food and fine real ales on tap. It's also located on the Halifax Road at postcode OL15 0LD. The aptly named Booth Wood Inn is located less than a mile north of the reservoir in Rishworth. It's a very good pub which does excellent food and has a good selection of drinks. It's in a good spot in the rural village and has a few tables outside for warmer days. You can find it on Oldham Rd with a postcode of HX6 4QU for your sat navs."
