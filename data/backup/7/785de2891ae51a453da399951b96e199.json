  "description": "Follow the River Hodder on this stunning waterside walk through the beautiful Forest of Bowland. The walk begins at Great Mitton and heads north through Whitewell, Newton and Slaidburn before a wonderful section around Stocks Reservoir finishes the route. There's great views of the surrounding Bowland Hills and lots of wildlife to look out for on the river. The Inn at Whitewell sits next to the river at Whitewell and is a great place to stop for refreshments or use as a base. The route also passes the expansive Gisburn Forest which has miles of woodland trails, streams and waterfalls to explore. You could use the route, the forest trails and Stocks Reservoir to create a nice circular walk here.",

      "content": "The Inn At Whitewell is a great place for refreshments after your walk. The beautiful inn sits in a wonderful location high on the banks of the River Hodder. It's a place of some note with a history stretching back hundreds of years. In the 1300\u2019s the inn was just a small manor house, lived in by the keepers of the Royal forest. It was not until the 1700\u2019s, that the building was transformed into a resting place where travellers en route to or from Lancaster could safely stay before continuing their perilous journey.  The inn has got a delightful interior and a nice outdoor seating area with views over the river. It's the ideal spot to rest your legs on a summer day. After your meal you can enjoy a stroll along the river where there are stepping stones and a waterfall nearby. You can find the inn a couple of miles south of Dunsop Bridge at postcode BB7 3AT.   Picture above: the Inn at Whitewell and the River Hodder stepping stones just below the inn."
