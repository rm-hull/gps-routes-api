  "description": "This rural Surrey village is surrounded by fields and woods with good walking trails to try. This circular walk takes you to some of the scenic highlights of the area. You'll visit Hydon's Ball and Hydon Heath before heading to the beautiful Winkworth Arboretum . The route also uses a section of the epic Greensand Way which runs right through the village. Start the walk in the village and follow the Greensand Way north east before picking up another public footpath at Court Farm. The path heads up to Fourteen Acre Copse before climbing to Hydon's Ball. The summit stands at 179 m (587 ft)  and includes a stone seat memorial to Octavia Hill , one of the founders of the National Trust. You can stop here and enjoy the wonderful views towards the South Downs. The trail then descends north east across Hydon Heath to Busbridge Woods and Munstead Farm before coming to Winkworth Arboretum. The popular site includes good surfaced footpaths, landscaped lakes and over 1,000 different shrubs and trees. After exploring the arboretum follow the footpaths back to Busbridge Woods and then turn south through the Juniper Valley to Hydon Heath. The trail heads past Burgate Farm and Durrants Knob, before linking up with the Greensand Way around Markwick Lane. Follow the waymarked trail west and it will take you to Van Hill before descending back into the village.",
