  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along Yeoman Hey Reservoir to Greenfield Reservoir in the Peak District National Park. You can start the walk from the car park at the northern end of Dovestone Reservoir. Then follow the footpaths along Yeoman Hey to Greenfield Reservoir. There's some stunning moorland scenery with the reservoirs surrounded by several striking Peak District Hills. At the top of the reservoir there\u2019s a lovely waterfall to admire. You can scramble up it to it for some fine views. You can extend the walk by continuing along the Greenfield Brook and heading onto Saddleworth Moor. Just a short distance to the west you can enjoy a climb to Pots and Pans. The noteworthy hill includes interesting rock formations, an obelisk war memorial and fine views to Manchester. The Oldham Way also runs past the reservoirs and is a great way of exploring the surrounding moors on a good waymarked path.",
