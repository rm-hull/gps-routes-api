  "description": "A popular section of the Isle of Wight Coast Path, running from Ryde to Bembridge. The walk runs for a distance of about 6.5 miles with lovely views for the duration of the route. The walk starts at Ryde, where the Portsmouth ferry docks. Here you can pick up the waymarked path and follow it past the popular Puckpool Park to Nettlestone Point at Seaview. The small Edwardian resort is popular with tourists and is a nice place to stop for refreshments at one of the pubs or cafes. The route continues south to Seagrove Bay and the well-known Priory Bay which is approximately a ten-minute walk from the village of Seaview. This stretch of beach can only be reached at low tide and is filled with white sand and offers excellent swimming conditions. The final section of the walk, passes Priory Woods and St Helens before picking up a nice path around Bembridge Harbour. You'll pass the eastern end of the River Yar before coming to Bembridge Point. From here it is a short stroll into the village centre. To extend your walk you can continue along the Isle of Wight Coast Path to Culver Cliff and Bembridge Down. You could also pick up the Bembridge Trail and follow it along the River Yar.",

      "content": "In August you can try the popular St Helens Fort Walk. The walk takes you out to the 19th century St Helens Fort along the causeway at low tide. Just west of Ryde there's another historic highlight at Quarr Abbey. The Grade I listed abbey monastery dates back to the 12th century and includes a scenic estate with lovely gardens, wildflower meadows and woodland with red squirrels to look out for. Just to the south west there's some peaceful woodland trails at Firestone Copse. The site includes lots of wildlife and views of the picturesque Wootton Bridge Old Mill Pond on its western side. Near here there's also the Isle of Wight Heritage Steam Railway train centre at Havenstreet Station, where the old trains make their way to join the electrified Ryde-Shanklin line at Smallbrook. The quaint station has been carefully restored to reflect a 1940s British Railways (Southern) style station. There is also a nice cafe and exhibits here. The station is located just a mile south of the woods at postcode PO33 4DS."
