  "description": "This loop walk explores the Sheep's Head peninsula located between Bantry Bay and Dunmanus Bay in County Cork. The headland is a popular place for walking and cycling with some stunning coastal scenery to enjoy. Historic features include the remains of an old copper mine, a blow hole, stone circles, standing stones, a Napoleonic signal tower and old churches.  There is also a photogenic lighthouse at the end of the peninsula. You can start the walk from the village of Bantry and then head west to the rugged hills and cliff tops. Here you can look out for wildlife including dolphins and various sea birds. To continue your coastal walking in the area you could head south west to Mizen Head which is traditionally regarded as the most southerly point of mainland Ireland. The stunning coastal area includes the Mizen Head Signal Station & Visitor Centre where you can learn all about this special area. Near here there's also Cape Clear, Ireland\u2019s southernmost inhabited Irish-speaking island. It's another wonderful, peaceful place for a walk with lots of wildlife and great views back to Mizen Head.",

There's a long circular trail to follow around the picturesque peninsula with pretty seaside villages, lovely beaches and bays. The trail is located near the delightful town of Clonakilty. The vibrant seaside town has a fine walk along Clonakilty Harbour to Inchydoney Island where there's a lovely blue flag beach. Near here there's also Galley Head where you can explore the sand dunes at Long Strand beach before heading towards the 19th century lighthouse at the end of the headland. Head north and you could visit Gougane Barra. Here you'll find some fine woodland trails, a pretty lake and a riverside path with views of the Shehy Mountains."
