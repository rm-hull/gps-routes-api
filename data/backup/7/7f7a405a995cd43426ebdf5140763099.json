  "description": "This loop walk explores the Sheep's Head peninsula located between\u00a0Bantry Bay\u00a0and\u00a0Dunmanus Bay\u00a0in\u00a0County Cork. The headland is a popular place for walking and cycling with some stunning coastal scenery to enjoy. \nHistoric features include the remains of an old copper mine, a blow hole, stone circles, standing stones, a Napoleonic signal tower and old churches.\u00a0 \nThere is also a photogenic lighthouse at the end of the peninsula. You can start the walk from the village of Bantry and then head west to the rugged hills and cliff tops. Here you can look out for wildlife including dolphins and various sea birds. To continue your coastal walking in the area you could head south west to Mizen Head which is traditionally regarded as the\u00a0most southerly point\u00a0of mainland\u00a0Ireland. The stunning coastal area includes the Mizen Head Signal Station & Visitor Centre where you can learn all about this special area. Near here there's also Cape Clear , Ireland\u2019s southernmost inhabited Irish-speaking island. It's another wonderful, peaceful place for a walk with lots of wildlife and great views back to Mizen Head.",
