  "description": "Ogmore by Sea is a pretty coastal village located at the mouth of the River Ogmore as it enters the sea on the Glamorgan coast. It's a fine place for walkers with coastal paths, lovely beaches and wonderful estuary views. This walk from the village takes you along a section of the Wales Coast Path from Ogmore to the lovely Dunraven Bay. It's about a 2.5 mile walk to the bay, so just under 5 miles there and back. Start the walk from the public car park on the sea front in Ogmore, close to the mouth of the Ogmore River. From here you can pick up the waymarked coastal trail and follow it south east to the pretty bay. Here you'll find a lovely beach, some impressive high cliffs and the Dancing Stones. The bay is also often referred to as Southerndown beach taking its name from the nearby village. It's a great place for fossil hunting and look for wildlife in the rock pools. Also keep your eyes peeled for the rare chough bird with its distinctive red bill and legs.",
