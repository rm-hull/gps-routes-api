  "description": "This pretty little Shropshire based village lies just to the north of Church Stretton in the Shropshire Hills AONB. This circular walk climbs to the viewpoint at Nover's Hill from the village. The hill lies just to the south west of the settlement and is a pleasant walk to try in the area. You can follow footpaths up towards the 305 metre high summit where there are some glorious views over the village to the surrounding hills and countryside. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit one of the local highlights at the National Trust's Carding Mill Valley . This path will take you up to the Long Mynd where there is a fantastic ridge top walk with more stunning views to enjoy.",
