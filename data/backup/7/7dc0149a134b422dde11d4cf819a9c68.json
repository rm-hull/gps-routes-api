There are very few viewing points around certain areas of the lake, in fact I get the impression that people are discouraged. Along the road a hedge purposely restricts viewing the reservoir. Obviously the number one priority is water, and with all this free rain we are having, and supply outdoing demand, drinking water will soon be very cheap!"

  "description": "Enjoy an easy walk around these two pretty reservoirs in the Dartmoor National Park. There are waterside walking trails running along the waters edge and then into surrounding woodland. The area is well signposted and there is seating and picnic area dotted around the walk. Look out for a variety of birdlife on the water and beautiful rhododendrons around the reservoir in the summer months. It's easy to extend your walk to Kennick Reservoir as this lies just to the north of Trenchford and Tottiford Reservoirs. This walk starts at the parking area at the western end of Tottiford Reservoir and takes you along the waterside paths. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Canonteign Falls where you'll find lakes, a wooded valley and a spectacular waterfall.",
