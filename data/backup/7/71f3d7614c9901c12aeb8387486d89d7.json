  "description": "This walk visits the Yr Eifl Quarry in the coastal village of Trefor on the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd. The walk starts in the village and heads west to pick up the track up to the quarry. Here you can follow trails around the unusual landscape while enjoying some splendid views to the coast and the village from the elevated location. It's a photogenic place with the old abandoned buildings and the steep cliff faces. You can extend your walk by continuing south to climb to Yr Eifl mountain and Tre'r Ceiri where you will find Britain's best preserved Iron Age hill fort. You could also pick up the Llyn Coastal Path and visit the nearby Trefor Sea Stacks.",
