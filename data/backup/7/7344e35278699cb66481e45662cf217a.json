  "description": "Enjoy a long loop walk around Muckross Lake on this wonderful walk in the Killarney National Park. Muckross is the deepest lake in Ireland and one of the three Lakes of Killarney, along with\u00a0Lough Leane\u00a0and\u00a0Upper Lake. This 14km (8.7 mile) circular trail takes you around the whole lake with views of the larger Lough Leane and a visit to the beautiful Torc Waterfall. The walk starts from Muckross House, where there is a good sized car park. From here you can pick up the trail, heading past the mansion and the walled garden to the lakeside at Lough Leane. You then pass along the Lough before heading into the woodland between the two lakes. The trail runs along the northern side of the little Doo Lough, before coming to the western end of Muckross Lake. The next stages passes the lovely Meeting of the Waters on the western side of the lake. This is the spot where\u00a0Killarney\u2019s Upper Lake flows down to join the lower loughs. You then head east along the southern side of the water, where you will meet with the Owengarriff River. Here you will find the wonderful Torc Waterfall . The 18 metre falls are a splendid sight with lush woodland and a lots interesting riverside plants and flowers to see. Look out for red deer as you make your way through this section. The final part of the walk passes along the river on the eastern side of the lake, returning you to Mucross House. The long distance Kerry Way, runs through the park so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Heading north will take you along Lough Leane into the town of Killarney. The lakes are not far from the town so you could start from the train station instead and follow the trail to the lakes and waterfall. The Lough Leane And Ross Castle Walk visits an historic 15th century castle on the shores of the lough in this area too. If you head south from Muckross House you can enjoy a climb to Torc Mountain for wonderful views over the park. Just to the west is the Gap of Dunloe with a fine walking trail heading through the narrow mountain pass.",
