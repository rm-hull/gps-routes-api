  "description": "This attractive Nottinghamshire village has some nice river and country trails to try. It sits in a fine rural spot just a couple of miles east of Nottingham. This walk from the village takes you to the nearby Holme Pierrepont Country Park along the Trent Valley Way. The walk starts in the village and heads west to the river where you can pick up the Trent Valley Way, opposite Stoke Bardolph. Follow the waymarked footpath south and it will take you past Radcliffe on Trent to Holme Pierrepont Park. Here you'll find a nature reserve, a number of lakes and the National Watersports Centre. On the opposite side of the river there's more nice waterside trails in Colwick Country Park near West Bridgford. The route returns to the village on the same paths though you could take a small detour to climb Shelford Hill to the south of the settlement. There are nice views over the area from this elevated spot.",
