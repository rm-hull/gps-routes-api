If not managed, heather grows into a dense mass of long woody stems, which supports very little wildlife and has reduced nutritional value for livestock and birds. Heather burning is a very old method of controlling and prolonging the life cycle of heather. It is a very skilled operation and must be carried out with extreme caution. There are strict guidelines that must be adhered to for a successful and safe burn."

Loch Freuchie is just over a mile long, quite shallow and offers good trout fishing. A crannog is an ancient lake dwelling made of timber and was in use from prehistoric times until the 17th century. Some were made by sinking a foundation of stones into shallow water, others by first enlarging islets in the lake. A platform about a foot above the water-level was created on which a homestead was built. They were mainly built as strongholds against attack."

The story goes that a young man named Fraoch, at the request of the lady Maidh, went to the dragon inhabited island to gather rowan berries. He completed the task and evaded the dragon but the lady insisted that nothing would please her except that he return to her with the uprooted rowan tree. On his second visit he got the tree but awoke the dragon, who, in mortal combat, gnawed off Fraoch's arms and legs."
