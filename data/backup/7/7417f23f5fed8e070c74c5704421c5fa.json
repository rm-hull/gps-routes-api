  "description": "Climb to the highest point in the Berwyn Mountains range on this challenging walk in North East Wales. The walk starts from the car park at Tan-y-pistyll and takes you to the beautiful Pistyll Rhaeadr Waterfall. The falls are 240-foot (73 m) high and regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of Wales. You'll pass through attractive woodland and along the rushing waters of the Afon (River) Rhaeadr on this section of the walk. You then climb to Moel Sych the joint second highest summit on the Berwyn range. Here you will find a cairn and lovely views down to Llyn Lluncaws. From Moel Sych you continue to the 832 m (2,730 ft) summit of Cadair Berwyn. The summit lies on the border between Powys and Denbighshire, and is the highest point in Denbighshire. The views in all directions are simply stunnning with Cheshire, the Brecon Beacons and Snowdonia all visible on a clear day. From here you could continue to Cadair Bronwen but this route descends to the glacial Llyn Lluncaws and then through the beautiful Cwm Nant y Llyn valley before returning to the car park. It's a nice descent with the Nant y Llyn stream and some gorgeous scenery to enjoy. There is a B&B and a cafe near the falls so you can refresh yourself after the walk.",
