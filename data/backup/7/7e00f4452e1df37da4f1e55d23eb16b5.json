As Sefton's only non-coastal reserve the valley provides a valuable and unique green oasis amongst what is otherwise a heavily populated and industrialised area. With its interesting network of pathways and raised boardwalks, Brookvale and Rimrose Valley as a whole provides opportunities for quiet informal countryside recreation in an area where such activities are scarce."
