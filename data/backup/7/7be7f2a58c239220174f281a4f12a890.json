  "description": "This walk visit visits the Cwmorthin Quarry and the adjacent lake in Tanygrisiau, north Wales. It's a beautiful place with a stream, mountains, gardens, waterfalls and some interesting mining history as well. The walk starts from the Cwmorthin car park, located just south of the site. You can follow footpaths north from here, taking you past the Cwmorthin Waterfall on the way. Near here you'll also pass the lovely Japanese Gardens, an additional feature on the walk. The route continues north along the stream, branching off to the east to explore the quarry where there are some disused buildings and fine views. After exploring the quarry you can then follow a track along the western side of the pretty Llyn Cwmorthin. You could turn it into a longer circular walk by heading around Foel Ddu, Rhosydd Quarry and Moel-yr-hydd to the west of the site.",
