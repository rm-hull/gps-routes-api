On 5 November 1380, King Richard II granted Sir William and Lady Margaret Asthorpe a licence to crenellate the Hemyock manor house; meaning the permission to fortify it. Hemyock Castle has many similarities with the much better known Bodiam Castle, granted the licence to crenellate in 1385. Parts of the castle walls, towers and moat still remain. They are a scheduled ancient monument. The castle site is privately owned: Visits can be arranged for groups; there are also public open days."

  "description": "Hemyock is notable as the largest village in the Blackdown Hills AONB. It's a pleasant settlement with an ancient ruined castle and views of the River Culm which flows through the village. There's also some nice country footpaths leading out from the village to the surrounding fields and woods. Local walking highlights include Culmstock Beacon and the Wellington Monument. Both of these sites lie just to the north and include wonderful viewpoints over the area. This little walk from the village takes you past the castle and the old church before following a country trail into the surrounding farmland. See the video and photos below for more details on the castle. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Hemyock. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
