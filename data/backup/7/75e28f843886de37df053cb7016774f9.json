  "description": "The Suffolk town of Beccles has some lovely riverside walks through the Broads National Park. This walk takes you to nearby Lowestoft along the Angles Way long distance footpath. It's a lovely area with riverside paths along the River Waveney and a visit to Oulton Broad and Carlton Marshes Nature Reserve at the end of the walk. The walk starts from the town which is located very close to the river. It runs for just under 9 miles along the waymarked path to Oulton Broad on the outskirts of Lowestoft. Along the way you'll pass pretty riverside cottages, boats, marshland and the Waveney Marina. Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of water loving birds as you go. To extend your walking in the area head through Lowestoft to the coast where you can head along the beach to Kessingland. Here you can pick up the Suffolk Coast Path long distance footpath. Just to the north east of Beccles you will find Somerleyton. The delightful model village includes thatched red-brick estate cottages and the splendid Somerleyton Hall with its beautiful gardens and expansive estate. The lovely large lake at Fritton Lake Country Park is also nearby and has some great waterside trails.",

You can enjoy refreshments on the lovely riverside terrace with fine views across the water to the surrounding countryside. The hotel also has an interesting history having been built in the early 16th Century during the reign of King Henry VIII. The first owner William Rede I, was the first Lord of the Manor of Beccles, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Inside you can see evidence of its past with the fine vaulted oak-beamed ceilings. You can find the hotel at Puddingmoor with a postcode of NR34 9PL for your sat navs."
