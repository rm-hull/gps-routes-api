  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle along the River Suir from Carrick-on-Suir to Clonmel on this lovely waterside route in County Tipperary. The Blueway/Greenway trail runs for just over 20km, passing along the flat riverside path. Along the way you will enjoy fine views of the countryside and the village of Kilsheelan. There's also picturesque old bridges, fine country homes and an historic castle to see on the route. You can continue along the blueway to visit the nearby Cahir Castle . The 12th century castle is well worth a visit with lovely grounds and a fascinating history. The section between Clonmel and Cahir is generally used by kayakers, paddle boarders and other water users.",
