The path here follows a dismantled railway line which was operated by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway line, linking the Midlands with the Norfolk Coast. Opened by the Eastern and Midlands Railway, it became the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, and was later converted to a joint operation of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, with the London and North Eastern Railway taking sole operation in 1936. The line was closed in 1959. The bridge carries Church Road across the dismantled railway trackbed."
