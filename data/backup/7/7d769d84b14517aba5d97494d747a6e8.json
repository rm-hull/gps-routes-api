  "description": "This walk visits a freshwater lake in the in the Burren National Park in County Clare. There is some roadside parking on the eastern side of the lake where you can enjoy a short stroll along the lake shore with some fine views across the water. Located midway between the towns of Corofin and Gort, the tranquil waters of Lough Bunny gently brush against the roadside. This lake is distinctive and precious, designated as a Special Area of Conservation under EU regulations. Lough Bunny's setting is among the most picturesque in the Burren, offering stunning views of Mullaghmore Mountain, notable for its extraordinary folded shape, a result of tectonic plate collisions millions of years ago. On the northeast shore of the lake, the remnants of a medieval tower house stand in silent testament to the past. Spanning approximately 100 hectares, Lough Bunny is relatively shallow, averaging just 2 metres in depth. Interestingly, it is not fed by any river but is believed to be supplied by a network of small springs. The lake's water has high concentrations of dissolved bicarbonate and supports minimal plant life due to low nutrient levels. Such lakes are rare in the EU.",

      "content": "Just to the west is the Lough Avalla Farm Loop. Another well trodden path it winds through the historic site of an ancient Celtic farm and briefly follows the picturesque shoreline of Lough Avalla. To the north you can enjoy more waterside walking on the Gort River Walk. The pleasant circular loop walk runs for about 3km along easy footpaths and country lanes around the historic town."
