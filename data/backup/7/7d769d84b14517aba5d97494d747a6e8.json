  "description": "This walk visits a\u00a0freshwater\u00a0lake in\u00a0the in the Burren National Park in County Clare. There is some roadside parking on the eastern side of the lake where you can enjoy a short stroll along the lake shore with some fine views across the water. Located midway between the towns of Corofin and Gort , the tranquil waters of Lough Bunny gently brush against the roadside. This lake is distinctive and precious, designated as a Special Area of Conservation under EU regulations. Lough Bunny's setting is among the most picturesque in the Burren, offering stunning views of Mullaghmore Mountain, notable for its extraordinary folded shape, a result of tectonic plate collisions millions of years ago. On the northeast shore of the lake, the remnants of a medieval tower house stand in silent testament to the past. Spanning approximately 100 hectares, Lough Bunny is relatively shallow, averaging just 2 metres in depth. Interestingly, it is not fed by any river but is believed to be supplied by a network of small springs. The lake's water has high concentrations of dissolved bicarbonate and supports minimal plant life due to low nutrient levels. Such lakes are rare in the EU.",
