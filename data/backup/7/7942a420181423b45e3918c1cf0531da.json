  "description": "This pretty village is located in the Wensleydale area of Yorkshire. There's nice trails along the River Bain, some beautiful Yorkshire Dales scenery and a historic pub to visit atfer your exercise. This circular walk from the village takes you south along the River Bain to visit the lovely Semer Water . The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths south along the river to Bracken Hill and Low Wheel before coming to the expansive lake. The site is notable as the second largest natural lake in North Yorkshire, England after Malham Tarn . After admiring the lake the route then heads through Countersett before following a country lane north to Gill Edge. There's excellent views over the area from this elevated viewpoint which stands at a height of 306 metres. From here you can descend back to the river and the village on a public footpath.",
