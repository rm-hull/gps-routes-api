  "description": "Ride a cable car to the Hilltop Park and enjoy magnificent views of the Derwent Valley and surrounding Peak District at this major attraction in Matlock. The park also includes caverns and mine tours where you can experience a day in the life of a 17th Century lead mining family. The cable car was opened in 1984 and is the first ever alpine cable car in Britain. It will take you to the top of Masson Hill where you can enjoy woodland walking trails and wonderful views over Matlock. There is also a riverside section along the River Derwent to enjoy. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Lumsdale Valley for a wonderful waterfall walk. The Derwent Valley Heritage Way also runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along the River Derwent if you have time. If you cross the river to the eastern side you can enjoy a climb to High Tor. The impressive limestone crag commands fine views over the town from the exciting narrow walkway of Giddy Edge .",
