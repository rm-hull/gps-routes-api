  "description": "Enjoy a walk around this atmospheric forest and nature reserve in the Dartmoor National Park. It's an unusual place consisting of stunted oak trees with gnarled, tangled branches. There's also lots of spongy moss and over 100 types of lichen hanging from the branches. Other features include boulders covered with lichen and other trees such as rowan,  holly, hawthorn, hazel and eared-willow. This circular walk starts at a car park near the Two Bridges Hotel,  just to the south of the wood. You then pick up a footpath to the nature reserve before climbing Longaford Tor, where there are great views over Dartmoor. You return passing Littaford Tors and Crockern Tor. The wood is located just to the north of Princetown which is on the Dartmoor Way . The eery Lych Way ancient footpath also passes the northern tip of the woods. To extend your walking try our Two Bridges Dartmoor Walk . The long circular walk starts from the same location and visits the wood before heading east to visit the fascinating gunpowder mill remains and the lovely Bellever Forest .",
