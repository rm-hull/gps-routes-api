  "description": "This pretty village is located in a pleasant rural location in north west Wiltshire. There's some riverside trails along the Bybrook River and nice countryside paths through the eastern section of the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The quaint settlement includes some picturesque old cottages and a village pond too. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring villages of Slaughterford and Ford. The walk starts in the village and follows Ham Lane west to link up with the Macmillan Way just south of Slaughterford. You can follow the waymarked footpath north through Slaughterford to Ford, passing Common Hill on the way. In Slaughterford there's a lovely old bridge over the river to see. You continue north east along the Bybrook River to Long Dean and Chapel Wood. The route then picks up another country lane and heads south past West Yatton adn Giddeahall before returning to Slaughterford.",

It's a picture postcard Cotswolds village with thatched cottages, a beautiful church with a medieval clock and traditional country pubs. To the south there's the splendid Corsham Court with its beautiful grounds, gardens and lake to see. Just to the south is the delightful village of Box. The village includes nice trails along the By Brook and the famous Box railway tunnel created by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in the early 19th century. Near here there's also Colerne where there's nearly 90 historic listed buildings including a 13th century church and a noteworthy 17th century stone pub.
