  "description": "This pretty village is located in a pleasant rural location in north west Wiltshire. There's some riverside trails along the Bybrook River and nice countryside paths through the eastern section of the Cotswolds\u00a0Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The quaint settlement includes some picturesque old cottages and a village pond too. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring villages of Slaughterford and Ford. The walk starts in the village and follows Ham Lane west to link up with the Macmillan Way just south of Slaughterford. You can follow the waymarked footpath north through Slaughterford to Ford, passing Common Hill on the way. In Slaughterford there's a lovely old bridge over the river to see. You continue north east along the Bybrook River to Long Dean and Chapel Wood. The route then picks up another country lane and heads south past West Yatton adn Giddeahall before returning to Slaughterford.",
