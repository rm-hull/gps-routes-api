You can find the pub at 7 Heptonstall Road with a postcode of HX7 6AZ for your sat navs. On the walk you could stop off in Pecket Well at the noteworthy Robin Hood Inn.

The Tudor inn is one of the oldest buildings in the village dating back to 1621. The hall has a fascinating history with two elaborate tunnels buried beneath it. Once used as an escape route, one of the tunnels connects directly to Haworth Parish Church. During times of religious persecution, the owners would use the tunnels beneath the house to offer the nonconformist people of Haworth a safe passage of escape from the forces of the Church of England. The hall does very good food and if the weather is fine you can sit out in the large beer garden. You can find the inn Sun Street at postcode BD22 8BP for your sat navs."
