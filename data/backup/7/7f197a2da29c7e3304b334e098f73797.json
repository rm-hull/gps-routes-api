  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the lovely Loch Trool in Glen Trool, Southern Uplands, Galloway. You can start off in the car park at the western end of the loch. From here you can pick up the Southern Upland Way and follow the waymarked footpath east along the southern side of the loch. This section passes the Steps of Trool and the site of the Battle of Glen Trool which took place in 1307. You continue east to Glenhead where you turn west to follow the Glenhead Burn to Buchan Bridge where there are some waterfalls to see. The route then heads west past Bruce's Stone to the woodland trails through Kenmure Knowe. Shortly after you return to the car park where the walk finishes.",

Here you'll find waterside trails and an interesting 14th century castle. Near Loch Doon there's also Loch Bradan, Loch Skelloch and the pretty Water of Girvan to explore. Loch Ken is located just to the east at New Galloway and includes a lovely RSPB Nature Reserve. Head east and there are more waterside trails around Clatteringshaws Loch and Loch Grannoch."
