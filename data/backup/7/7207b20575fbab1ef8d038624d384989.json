  "description": "This delightful Lancashire village sits on the southern edge of the Forest of Bowland AONB in the beautiful Ribble Valley. It's a very pretty place with some historic buildings, the lovely Coronation Gardens and the picturesque Waddington Brook flowing through the village. This circular walk from the village takes you through the surrounding countryside to visit Eaves Hall, West Bradford and the River Ribble. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north east to Eaves House before coming to Eaves Hall. This fine Georgian mansion is surrounded by beautiful gardens and is now used as a wedding venue. The route then heads through the village of West Bradford where you can pick up a section of the Ribble Way and follow it south along the river to Horrocksford and Clitheroe. You then cross the river at Brungeley Bridge before following country lanes back into Waddington.",
