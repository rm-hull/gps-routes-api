  "description": "A circular walk around the Gloucestershire village of Twyning, visiting the River Avon and the River Severn. It's a lovely, scenic area with riverside meadows, common land and some fine views from the high points on the walk. The walk starts in the village and heads a short distance to the east to meet up with the River Avon. You can then follow Shakespeare's Avon Way south towards The Mythe near Tewkesbury . You could head south here to visit the marinas and St John's Bridge in the town. This route heads north along the river towards Queenhill, passing the former clay pits at Mythe Hook and the viewpoint at Mythe Tute. The route then turns east to visit the village of Ripple. From here you follow country lanes south past Towbury Hill Fort before turning east to Puckrup and then on to Twyning.",
