  "description": "A circular walk around the Gloucestershire village of Twyning, visiting the River Avon and the River Severn. It's a lovely, scenic area with riverside meadows, common land and some fine views from the high points on the walk. The walk starts in the village and heads a short distance to the east to meet up with the River Avon. You can then follow Shakespeare's Avon Way south towards The Mythe near Tewkesbury. You could head south here to visit the marinas and St John's Bridge in the town. This route heads north along the river towards Queenhill, passing the former clay pits at Mythe Hook and the viewpoint at Mythe Tute. The route then turns east to visit the village of Ripple. From here you follow country lanes south past Towbury Hill Fort before turning east to Puckrup and then on to Twyning.",

In the famous city you can also enjoy a visit to the historic Worcester Cathedral. Along the way you'll pass close to the delightful village of Hanley Swan. The picturesque settlement includes a pretty village green, a pond, a 17th century pub and walking trails to neighbouring Hanley Castle where you can see the remains of the ancient fort. The river trails and historic 16th century pub at Upton Upon Severn are also located in this area. The circular walk from Ashton Under Hill to the picture postcard village of Elmley Castle and the fine viewpoint at Bredon Hill lies just a few miles to the east. Also to the east is the worthy village of Kemerton where there are two wildlife rich nature reserves to explore. The village is very pretty with the 16th century Kemerton Court and a Grade II listed church to see as well. Near here there's also the Beckford Nature Reserve with its bluebell woods and lakeside paths."
