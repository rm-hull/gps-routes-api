  "description": "This attractive seaside village is located in the South Hams area of South Devon. It's a popular place for a walk with a beautiful beach, a fantastic tidal island, a river estuary and some splendid countryside. There's also a couple of noteworthy ancient pubs with a history dating back over 700 years. This route uses part of the Avon Estuary Walk and the South West Coast Path to create a circular walk around the village. On the way you'll visit Burgh Island and the neighbouring villages of Aveton Gifford and Bigbury. The route starts on the sea front in the village and heads over to the island. You can cross over on foot over the beach at low tide or catch the sea tractor run by the hotel on the island. The island has a strong assocation with Agatha Christie, serving as the inspirational setting for the mystery 'And Then There Were None'. After exploring the island you return to the mainland and head along the coast to Sharpland Point, Folly Hill and Cockleridge. Here you can catch the seasonal ferry over the Avon to Bantham on the opposite side. The route then picks up the Avon Estuary Walk and follows the waymarked footpath north east past Aunemouth Sands, Stiddicombe Wood, Stadbury Farm and Efford Farm before coming to Aveton Giffford Bridge. Here you cross the river to enter the village of Aveton Giffford. The pretty village lies at the head of the estuary of the\u00a0River Avon and includes a 13th century church and the streamside Fisherman's Rest pub. After exploring the village you head south west along the other side of the river, passing Milburn Orchard, Bigbury village and Bigbury golf course. Shortly after passing around the course you descend back into Bigbury on Sea.",
