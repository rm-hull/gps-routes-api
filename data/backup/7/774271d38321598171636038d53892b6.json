Work started on this brick castle in 1441, brick was an unusual material for a castle due it's weakness over stone, hence it was more of a fortified house than a true castle. In 1776 the interior was ripped out and sold, so until 1912 only the outer walls remained, then the interior was rebuilt. The castle is now owned by Queen's University of Ontario, Canada, they use it as an International Study Centre."

Observing conditions at Greenwich deteriorated following the urban growth of London, and plans were made in the early 20th century to relocate the observatory to a rural location with clearer, darker skies. The relocation of the observatory took place over a decade, and was complete by 1957. The institution at Herstmonceux Castle was known as the Royal Greenwich Observatory, where it remained until 1988, when the observatory relocated to Cambridge."
