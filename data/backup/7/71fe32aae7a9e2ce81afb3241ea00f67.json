  "description": "This Derbyshire village lies just to the west of Eyam in the Peak District National Park. The picturesque settlement includes pretty limestone cottages, a village green, a pond and a fine local pub dating back to the mid 18th century. For walkers there's lots of good footpaths taking you out into the surrounding countryside of the White Peak. This circular walk from Foolow takes you east to visit neighbouring Eyam. The historic 'Plague Village' is one of the highlights of the area with interesting old cottages and the 17th century Eyam Hall to see. There's also great views over the White Peak from the elevated position of Eyam Edge. On the first section you will pass also pass the Swallet Waterfall. The secluded little spot contains the 2nd highest waterfall in the Peak District and lies just east of Foolow. You can see more details and photos on the Eyam Waterfall Walk page. For more walks in the area scroll down to the list below.",
