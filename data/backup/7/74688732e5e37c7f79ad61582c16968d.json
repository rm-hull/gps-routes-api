  "description": "A circular walk around the village of Goathland in the North York Moors. The route visits the lovely Mallyan Spout waterfall before a climb into the hills surrounding the village. There's much to enjoy with the rushing waters of the West Beck and wonderful views from the heather topped hills of Simon Howe and Tow Howes Rigg. You can start the walk from the main parking area in the village centre or from the train station on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. Follow the road south west for about half a mile and you will come to a path just to right of the Malyan Spout Hotel. Follow the trail north west and you will soon come to the West Beck and the waterfall. The splendid 70 ft falls are the highest on the North York Moors. After admiring the falls you return to the hotel and continue along the road for a short distance. You can then pick up trails to take you up onto the moors where you can climb to Simon Howe, which stands at a height of 260m(853ft). It's a lovely spot with purple heather and fabulous views over the village, Cropton Forest and the surrounding moors. The route then descends to Two Howes Rigg and Moorgates, where you pick up a trail to take you back into Goathland. The long distance Lyke Wake Walk runs across Simon Howe so you could pick this up to continue your walking around Goathland. Following it east will take you to the coast at Ravenscar via Stony Leas and Crag Stone Rigg hills. Also of interest is the Grosmont to Goathland Rail Trail. This visits the delightful hamlet of Beck Hole and includes a waterside section along the Murk Esk River.",
