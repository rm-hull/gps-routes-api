The south range is largely ruined and the buildings on the south-east where probably never even completed. The castle was built by the de la Bere family during the 1300s, with David de la Bere the probable founder early in the century. A second stage of construction added the accommodation within this north range, which included a hall, solar and kitchen, together with the porch seen here. This was the work of Sir Rhys Thomas around 1500. Further extensions seem to have been planned but never carried out. By the C16 the castle had degenerated into a tenant farm."

  "description": "This North Gower based village has some nice trails along the marshland and Loughor estuary. This circular walk from the village takes you west to visit Weobley Castle and Landimore. The walk starts in the village and follows a section of the Wales Coast Path west to Weobley Castle. The castle dates back to the 14th century having been built by the de la Bere family around 1304. You can explore the dramatic ruins which are in a fine location overlooking the saltmarsh and wild estuary. The route continues past Castle Wood to Landimore before following a country lane back to Leason. From here you continue east to return to the village.",
