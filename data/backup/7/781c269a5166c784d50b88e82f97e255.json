Two specks can be seen just to the right of centre; two tourist trains passing at Halfway station.

  "description": "Climb to the summit of Snowdon on the ranger path on this challenging walk in the Snowdonia National Park. You can start your walk from the National Park car park next to Llyn Cwellyn and the Snowdon Ranger railway station. From here you can pick up the path, heading east away from the lake. It's generally a good track with rockier sections as you approach the summit. It runs for nearly 4 miles with wonderful views over the surrounding mountains and the numerous beautiful lakes. The route actually passes very close to Llyn Ffynnon-y-gwas and Llyn Du r Arddu as you approach the summit. You will also pass Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, considered to be one of the best climbing cliffs in Britain. Here there are magnificent views of the Llechog ridge and Cwm Clogwyn with the lakes of Llyn Glas, Llyn Coch and Llyn Nadroedd. (Blue Lake, Red Lake and Snakes' Lake). From the Snowdon summit the views are also impressive with 18 lakes and 14 peaks visible. On a clear day you can see as far as Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Lake District. The ranger path is one of several routes to the summit. You can also try the Llanberis Path , Miners Track , Pyg Track and the Rhyd Ddu Path . For an exhilarating circular ridge walk, taking in the Crib Goch ridge, try the Snowdon Horseshoe . You can virtually climb the mountain using the google street view link below!",
