  "description": "Enjoy wonderful views over Stratford-Upon-Avon and the surrounding Warwickshire countryside in this elevated country park. The park can be reached by following the Monarch's Way north from the Stratford-Upon-Avon (about 1 mile) or by parking at the provided car park. The area is also a nature reserve with grassland, woodland and ponds. Look out for Sparrowhawk, Kestrel, Green Woodpecker and Great Spotted Woodpecker. You may also see deer on the hills.",

      "content": "Follow the Monarch's Way south from the park and it will take you into Stratford Upon Avon. There's nice river walks, the famous Royal Shakespeare Theatre and easy trails along the Stratford Upon Avon Canal to enjoy here. Head north west along the canal and you could visit the Edstone Aqueduct, the longest cast iron aqueduct in England. There's great views from the top of this significant local structure. Heading north will take you into the village of Snitterfield where there's the Snitterfield Bushes Nature Reserve and a nice local pub with a particularly lovely garden. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
