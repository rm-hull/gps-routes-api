The park can be reached by following the Monarch's Way north from the Stratford-Upon-Avon (about 1 mile) or by parking at the provided car park. The area is also a nature reserve with grassland, woodland and ponds. Look out for Sparrowhawk, Kestrel, Green Woodpecker and Great Spotted Woodpecker. You may also see deer on the hills.",
