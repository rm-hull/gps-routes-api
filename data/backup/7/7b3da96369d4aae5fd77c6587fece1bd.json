  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk along Bournemouth's East Cliff to Boscombe Pier before returning along the beach. It's about a 3 mile walk on generally flat paths with only a couple of small climbs. The walk starts at Bournemouth Pier and then climbs to the left of the prom up towards the Russell Coates Museum. The walk then follows East Overcliff Drive where you have lovely coastal views from the elevated position of the path. Follow the road for just over a mile and you will arrive at Boscombe where you can enjoy a stroll through the Boscombe Chine Gardens. You then head down to the beach and Boscombe Pier before heading back along the prom to Bournemouth. In Boscombe you have the option of extending the walk by heading up to the pretty Overcliff Gardens which are located just to the north east of the pier. If you'd like to continue your walking you can pick up the Bournemouth Coast Path and head east to visit Southbourne, Christchurch Harbour, Hengistbury Head and Mudeford where there are splendid views to the Isle of Wight.",
