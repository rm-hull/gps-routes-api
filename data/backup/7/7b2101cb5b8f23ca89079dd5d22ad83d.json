  "description": "A stunning walk through the Lake District's Great Langdale Valley. The route follows two pretty becks with fine views of the valley's mountains for the duration of the walk. The walk starts from the car park in Elterwater where you can pick up the Cumbria Way long distance trail and follow it west to the Great Langdale Beck. The path will take you to the Dungeon Ghyll hotel where there is a nice climb up to Stickle Tarn. The waymarked path leads you north west below Raven Crag, the famous Langdale Pikes and Langdale Fell where there is another waterside path along the Mickleden Beck. The final section then climbs up the Snake Pass to meet with the Langstrath Beck in the Langstrath Valley. You can extend the walk by continuing north to the village of Rosthwaite in lovely Borrowdale. To explore the area further head east from the car park on our Chesters by the River Walk. This will take you past Elterwater Lake and Skelwith Force Waterfall to the pretty riverside cafe.",
