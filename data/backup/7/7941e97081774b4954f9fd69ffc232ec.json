There are large houses set among trees, with unexpected views of the sea, and a village pond given by H de Vere Stacpole, author of Blue Lagoon. Other residents included Tennyson, Macauley and Elisabeth Sewell. St Boniface's Church is in the middle of the picture. It was built in 1847-8. By Ferrey, 1847-8. Quite a large church in Norman style with transepts and a bellcote. The stained glass is mostly by Wailes, but the two saints in the E and W windows of the S transept are by Henry Holiday, 1878. In the churchyard is the mausoleaum of the Leeson family, with egyptian motifs and the dates 1864, 1867 and 1872."

  "description": "Visit the highest point on the Isle of Wight and enjoy wonderful views over the island's coast and countryside on this circular walk. Look out for various pretty wildflowers, heather and New Forest Ponies on St Boniface Down. You may also see other wildlife such as skylark, meadow pipit, buzzards, kestrels, various butterflies and a herd of Old English goats which graze on Bonchurch Down and Coombe Bottom.  The area also has an interesting military history with various WW2 buildings and the RAF Ventnor Radar Station which played an important role in the Battle of Britain. The walk starts from the Ventnor Down National Trust car park and takes you across Luccombe Down, Bonchurch Down and St Boniface Down. There's some challenging climbing but you are rewarded with fabulous views to Sandown Bay, Culver Cliffs and Portsmouth. You can extend your walk by heading to the nearby Wroxall Down or by following the Isle of Wight Coast Path west to St Catherine's Lighthouse. The Shanklin to Ventnor Coastal Walk is also very popular with more lovely sea views and some interesting woodland trails. You can visit the downs by bike by following Regional Cycle Route 67 otherwise known as the 'Round the Island' route.",
