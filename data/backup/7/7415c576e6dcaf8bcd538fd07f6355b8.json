  "description": "This walk takes you to the 648 metres (2,126 feet) summit of this imposing fell in the Lake District. This circular walk starts at Gatesgarth in the Buttermere valley and climbs steeply to the summit via Fleetwith Edge. From here there are wonderful views of the nearby Pillar and Great Gable fells and the lakes of Crummock Water, Loweswater and Buttermere. From the summit the route then descends to Bell Crags, passing Honistor Crag on the way. You continue to Wanscale Bottom, passing waterfalls and the pretty Wanscale Beck. It's a steep and challenging climb to the summit but with an easier, more gradual descent. The pike can also be climbed from the nearby Honister Pass Slate Mine. There's a car park and visitor centre with mine tours and the amazing Infinity Bridge to see here.",
