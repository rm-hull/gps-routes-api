  "description": "A popular coastal walk between these two North Devon settlements, using a section of the South West Coast Path. The route runs for a distance of about 5 miles so it's perfect for an afternoon walk. It's undulating path with some moderate climbs but with great views all the way from the elevated position of the cliff top path. The walk starts on the front in Ilfracombe and heads east past Capstone Point where there is a bench and a telescope to enjoy the view. You continue to Beacon Point which marks the northern side of Hillsborough Down and has nice views over Hele Bay. You continue past Samson's Bay and Widmouth Head before passing a series of caves on the outskirts of Combe Martin. The final section passes another fine viewpoint at Lester Point before coming into Combe Martin itself. To continue your walking in the area head east and visit The Hangman Hills where you can climb to the highest point on the South West Coast Path at Great Hangman. You could also explore the Heddon Valley with the climb giving great views back down to Combe Martin.",

It also visits the woodland trails in the Borough Valley between Lee and Ossaborough. From Ilfracombe you can catch a boat to the beautiful Lundy Island. The island is owned by the National Trust and has some splendid coastal walking trails. It's also a nature reserve with lots of wildlife to see, including the famous Lundy puffins. For more walking ideas in the area see the Exmoor Walks and North Devon Coast Walks pages."
