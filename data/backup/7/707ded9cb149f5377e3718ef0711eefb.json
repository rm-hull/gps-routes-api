  "description": "This beautiful lakeside country park is situated in the Lake District National Park at the southern tip of Lake Windermere.  You can stroll along the wide lawns and along the lakeshore or hire a row boat.  The walk below takes you around the park and up to the nearby Simpson Reservoir before returning to the lakeshore. If you'd like to extend your walk then you could climb the nearby Gummers How. This hill is situated a short walk from Fell Foot and offers great views over Lake Windermere. Just to the east you can visit the interesting hamlet of Cartmel Fell where you will find a Grade I listed church dating from 1504. There's also the nearby Raven's Barrow where there are fine views from over the Winster valley to enjoy.",
