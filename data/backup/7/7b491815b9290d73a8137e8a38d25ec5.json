  "description": "Follow the River Irwell on this splendid waterside walk through Greater Manchester and enjoy over 70 artworks by renowned artists. The walk starts at Salford Quays and follows the trail north through Radcliffe, Bury and Ramsbottom towards Bacup. The walk visits some lovely riverside country parks including Clifton Country Park and Burrs Country Park. You also pass Outwood Country Park where you can pick up the Outwood Trail. Another route highlight is a nice stretch along the Bury Canal where you'll pass the pretty Elton Reservoir. Near Rawtenstall and Ramsbottom you will pass close to the Peel Tower. The monument is dedicated to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th century Prime Minister considered the father of modern British policing. It's a major local landmark and worth the climb to the top for the views over the area. The trail also visits a series of art galleries and museums including the Lowry and the East Lancashire Railway.",
