It's a great place for a walk with natural Scots pinewood and wildlife including Red Squirrel and Capercaillie to look out for. The Speyside Way also runs through the woods providing an opportunity to further extend your walking in the area. There's also the Grantown On Spey Circular River Walk which includes a pleasant riverside stroll along the River Spey.",
