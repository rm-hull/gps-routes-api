According to the sign at the start of this path, a Restricted Byway is one that legally allows use by walkers, horse riders, cyclists, horse drawn carriages, and by some classes of mobility vehicles for the disabled. One wonders what class of mobility vehicles for the disabled are not allowed... Definitely banned are motor-cycles, four-wheel drive vehicles and quad bikes. Evidently the authority drawing up the sign considered that drivers of the banned vehicles would be incapable of reading any text about this prohibition and had to get the message across by use of symbols with a red diagonal bar across them."

  "description": "These woods near Marlow have some nice walking trails to try. Bisham Woods actually consists of several woods including Quarry Wood, Fultness Wood and Inkydown Wood. The area covers nearly 400 acres and are considered 'the richest ancient woods in Berkshire'. There's lots to see with bluebells, beechwoods, ponds, woodland orchids and some climbs with great views over the Chilterns and Marlow. Other features in the wood include an ice house constructed in the 1760\u2019s and Bisham Quarry which provided the stone for Windsor Castle. The circular walking route below takes you along various trails in the central and southern section of the woods but there are also bridleways running through Quarry Woods which are suitable for cyclists. Please stick to the marked bridleways if you are on your bike. Bisham Woods are thought to have been the original 'Wild Wood' in Kenneth Grahame's 'Wind in the Willows', which he wrote in the nearby village of Cookham Dean. The woods are located very close to the River Thames so it's easy to extend your walk. You could pick up the Thames Path and head east to Cliveden House. Here you'll find a fine Italianate mansion with lots of parkland and gardens to explore.",
