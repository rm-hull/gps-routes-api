According to the sign at the start of this path, a Restricted Byway is one that legally allows use by walkers, horse riders, cyclists, horse drawn carriages, and by some classes of mobility vehicles for the disabled. One wonders what class of mobility vehicles for the disabled are not allowed... Definitely banned are motor-cycles, four-wheel drive vehicles and quad bikes. Evidently the authority drawing up the sign considered that drivers of the banned vehicles would be incapable of reading any text about this prohibition and had to get the message across by use of symbols with a red diagonal bar across them."

  "description": "These woods near Marlow have some nice walking trails to try. Bisham Woods actually consists of several woods including Quarry Wood, Fultness Wood and Inkydown Wood. The area covers nearly 400 acres and are considered 'the richest ancient woods in Berkshire'. There's lots to see with bluebells, beechwoods, ponds, woodland orchids and some climbs with great views over the Chilterns and Marlow. Other features in the wood include an ice house constructed in the 1760\u2019s and Bisham Quarry which provided the stone for Windsor Castle. The circular walking route below takes you along various trails in the central and southern section of the woods but there are also bridleways running through Quarry Woods which are suitable for cyclists. Please stick to the marked bridleways if you are on your bike. Bisham Woods are thought to have been the original 'Wild Wood' in Kenneth Grahame's 'Wind in the Willows', which he wrote in the nearby village of Cookham Dean. The woods are located very close to the River Thames so it's easy to extend your walk. You could pick up the Thames Path and head east to Cliveden House. Here you'll find a fine Italianate mansion with lots of parkland and gardens to explore.",

You can find it right next to Marlow Bridge at a postcode of SL7 1RG for your sat navs. The Two Brewers is also located near the river in Marlow. The 18th century pub does great food and also has a nice beer garden. You can find it on St. Peter Street at postcode SL7 1NQ."

      "content": "Higginson Park in Marlow is a nice place to visit near the woods. The popular park attracts 1,000,000 visitors a year and includes riverside views and access to open countryside. There are also many fine trees and large expanses of lawn with formal flowerbeds and a brick in grass maze. It's another good option for refreshments with a nice cafe. You can find the park on the western fringes of the town, next to the river. Just to the east of the woods you could pick up the Bourne End Walk. The village includes the National Trust's Cock Marsh and an excellent riverside pub in the shape of The Bounty. Just to the east of Marlow is the neighbouring village of Little Marlow. Here you can explore the wildlife rich Spade Oak Nature Reserve and visit the historic 14th century church and 16th century pub.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Berkshire Walks page."
