  "description": "Visit this fascinating Bronze Age stone circle and enjoy a hike across Stapeley Common and Stapeley Hill, on this lovely circular walk on the Wales - England border. It's a very beautiful and atmospheric area with the ancient stones surrounded by the stunning scenery of the Shropshire Hills AONB. You can start the walk from the parking area near the stones and cross the dry heathland to the site. The site originally consisted of 30 stones, of which 15 now remain. The surviving stones range in height from just 10 inches to 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 metres), standing in an ellipse 89 feet by 82 feet (27 metres by 25 metres). After exploring the site you can continue your walk by climbing to Stapeley Hill. Along the way there are fabulous views over the surrounding hills and countryside from the high points. The climb to Corndon Hill starts from the same location. You can follow tracks south to climb the hill which straddles the border with Wales. It's a great viewpoint with stunning views across the Welsh Mountains and Shropshire Hills. The long distance Bishop's Castle Ring also passes the stone circle. You can pick it up to explore the area surrounding the market town which lies just to the south.",
