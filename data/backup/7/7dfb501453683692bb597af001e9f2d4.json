  "description": "This is a popular climb to Hay Bluff hill in the Black Mountains. The hill straddles the border of Wales and England. Most of the area lies within Powys with the eastern flanks in Herefordshire. From the summit there are wonderful views over the Wye Valley and the Welsh Mountains. This walk starts from the Hay Bluff car park located just half a mile north west of the hill. However, you could also start the walk from Hay on Wye. Just follow the Offa's Dyke Path south from the town centre for about three miles and you will reach the hill. The path passes Cusop and Tack Wood before arriving at the car park and Stone Circle at the foot of the climb. The route to the 677 m (2,221 ft) passes Ffynnon y Parc on a good path.  You can further explore the area as the entire hill is designated as open country so walkers have the freedom to roam at will. You can extend your walk by continuing south along the Offa's Dyke Path to the nearby Black Mountain South Top and the Hatterrall Ridge. Also nearby is a similar short climb to Lord Hereford's Knob (Twmpa) .",
