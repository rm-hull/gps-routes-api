  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Loch of Strathbeg near Rattray and Crimond in Aberdeenshire. It's a nice place for an easy stroll with views across the freshwater loch to the reserve's wetland, dunes and grassland. You can start the walk from the RSPB car park and visitor centre at Starnafin. From here you can pick up footpaths heading towards the boardwalks and bird hides next to the loch. At the site you can look out for a variety of waders and wildfowl with the pink-footed geese one of the highlights. Other species include Konik Ponies, Lapwing, Grey Heron and The Great White Egret. Just to the west of the site you can pick up the Formartine and Buchan Way . This shared cycling and walking trail follows a dismantled railway line from Dyce to Fraserburgh.",
