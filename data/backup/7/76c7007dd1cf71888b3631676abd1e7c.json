The cable car provides not only a lifeline for the island's few semi-permanent residents but also offers an adventurous way for visitors to experience the island's tranquil beauty. The island itself is a peaceful retreat, home to just a handful of people and characterised by its serene landscapes, making it an ideal destination for those seeking solitude and a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life."
