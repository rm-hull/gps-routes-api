  "description": "This circular walk from the Northumberland village of Harbottle climbs to Cold Law, Dove Crag and Harbottle Crags. It's an interesting and peaceful area with some splendid geology and wonderful views to the Cheviot Hills enjoy. The walk starts from the historic Harbottle Castle ruins and follows country lanes south east to Rockey's Hall. Here you follow footpaths south into Harbottle Woods, passing Gallow Edge and Sealburn Quarry before coming to Cold Law and Harbottle Crag. The hill rises to a heigh of 361 metres commanding fine views over the Northumberland National Park. The route then loops round to visit the scenic area of Dove Crag where you will find photogenic rock formations and pretty heather. From here you continue north through the woods to return to the country lane leading back to the village. To continue your walking in the area follow footpaths west to visit the Drake Stone and Harbottle Lake. Here you will find a huge sandstone boulder which has been compared to the Bowder Stone in the Borrowdale area of the Lake District National Park. The stone is one of the area highlights and a popular place for photographers to capture an atmospheric shot of the local landscape.",

The inn is steeped in history and would have once been used by drovers crossing the Anglo-Scottish border just a few miles away in The Cheviot Hills. It was built using sandstone from the ruins of nearby Harbottle Castle. They have a good menu and some outdoor seating for warmer days. There is also a well stocked village shop and newsagents at the side of the pub, which is also a small Information Point for the Northumberland National Park. The pub provides rooms if you wish to stay in the area. You can find them at postcode NE65 7DG for your sat navs."
