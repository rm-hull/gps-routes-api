  "description": "This country park in Walkden has nice footpaths to follow around the lake and through woodland. It's a nice peaceful place to visit with lots of birdlife to look out for on the lake. These include Herons, Tufted Ducks, Goosander, Water Rail, Coots and Moorhen. There's a car park and visitor centre where you can pick up the lakeside trail. You can also come by public transport as Walkden train station is only about a mile away. This route is designed for walkers but a cycle route runs through the northern end of the park. National Cycle Network Route 55 also runs close to the park. You could follow it from the centre of Manchester, through Salford and Roe Green to Walkden. If you feel like extending your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Moses Gate Country Park. It's only a couple of miles to the north and covers 750 acres with a number of nice cycling and walking trails. The site is located on the outskirts of Bolton and includes three lakes while the Rivers Croal and Irwell also run through the park. Also nearby is Clifton Country Park. Located alongside the River Irwell the park contains walking and cycling trails with features including a pretty lake, woodland, meadows and an arboretum.",
