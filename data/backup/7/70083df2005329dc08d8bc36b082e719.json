A couple of Dartmoor ponies are taking shelter from the wind in its archway. The line, which opened in 1823, was constructed as a tramroad to carry stone from Foggintor Quarry off the moor. It was later adapted in 1882 as the GWR branch line from Yelverton to Princetown. The line finally closed in March 1956 due to dwindling use (prior to the Beeching cuts), and the track removed a year later."

None of the current Ordnance Survey maps gives a height for King's Tor but Victorian versions show a spot level of 1314 feet, presumably for the highest point, which is almost exactly 400 metres above sea level. A group of people on top give an indication of scale. Possibly because the quality of the granite was not as good as to be found in the neighbouring tors, Foggintor and Swelltor, King's Tor has only slightly been altered by quarrying works."

  "description": "This circular walk visits the Foggintor Quarries near Princetown on Dartmoor. The route also climbs to the nearby King's Tor for fine views over the area. The walk starts from the public car park in the village of Princetown, just to the east of the site. From here you can pick up a section of the Dartmoor Way and follow the waymarked footpath west along a dismantled railway line. After about 1.5 miles you turn north to follow a footpath to the quarry. Here you'll find a tranquil lake surrounded by the atmospheric quarry ruins. It's a photogenic spot which also gives an insight into the areas mining heritage. After exploring the quarry you continue west to visit the neighbouring Swelltor Quarries before climbing up to King's Tor. There's excellent views over the National Park from this elevated location. The trail then loops around the hill before returning to Princetown on an alternative bridleway.",
