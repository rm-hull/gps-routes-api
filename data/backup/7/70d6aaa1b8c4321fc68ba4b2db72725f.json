  "description": "This pretty glen on the Isle of Man is perfect for a peaceful stroll in beautiful surroundings. In the glen you will find woodland paths taking you to a delightful waterfall and a pebble beach on the coast. It's a very pretty area with the rushing water of the Rushen River surrounded by lush vegetation such as wild garlic and ferns. The striking cliffs at the western end of the glen have wonderful views across the coast. They are also a good place to look out for sea birds, fulmars and hawks. There is a good sized car park on Shore Road at the eastern end of the glen. From here you can directly pick up the footpaths through the glen. At the beach the glen links with the Raad ny Foillan (Isle of Man Coastal Path) . If you pick this up and head north you can visit Peel Castle.",
