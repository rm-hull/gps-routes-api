The earthworks and ruins are believed to be the remains of Bishop Herbert de Losinga's late 11th-century episcopal church and the late 14th-century double-moated castle built on this by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich. Henry came from a powerful family who had strong connections with the House of Plantagenet and the notorious 'favourites' of King Edward II."

  "description": "This pretty Norfolk village is located near Swanton Morley on the western bank of the River Wensum . The village is noted for the ancient ruins of a Norman Chapel on the site of an even earlier Anglo Saxon timber cathedral. This walk explores the English Heritage owned chapel grounds which are located just to the north of the village. You can follow paths around the site before heading east to pick up the trackbed of the Great Eastern Railway next to the River Wensum Meadows. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the Walsingham Way . The long distance route takes you from the historic abbey in Great Walsingham to the city of Norwich . If you follow it south east it will take you along the River Wensum to neighbouring Swanton Morley where you will find a noteworthy 14th century church and an early 17th century pub with links to the ancestors of Abraham Lincoln.",
