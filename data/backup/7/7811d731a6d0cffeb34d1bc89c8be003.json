  "description": "This New Forest village is a fine place to start a walk with a number of great local trails and a fine local pub to relax in after your exercise. It's well located for visitors to the Sandy Balls holiday, camping and caravan park which lies just to the west. This circular walk starts from the village and takes you north to explore the woodland trails in the Godshill Inclosure. You can follow footpaths north west to Godshill Wood where you can pick up the Avon Valley Path and follow it north east to the Castle Hill viewpoint. There's seats to rest and look out across the floodplain of the River Avon here. The route then follows footpaths through the inclosure where you can see some lovely rhododendrons. From here you then head south to Densome Corner, Millersford Bottom and Gravel Pit Hill. The final section then takes you through the Godshill Ridge, passing the Pottery before returning to the village. Around the Ridge you can pick up the Ashley Walk which begins at the car park on Roger Penny Way, just north east of Godshill. It's a pleasant area to extend your walk with fine heathland trails and evidence of the old WW2 testing site still in existence.",
