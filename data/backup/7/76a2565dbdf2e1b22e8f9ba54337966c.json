  "description": "The hamlet of Crowden is a popular start point for exploring a stunning area of the Pennines. There's a handy car park and camping site where many fine walks can be started. This circular walk from Crowden climbs to the nearby Black Hill. It's a popular and quite challenging climb using a section of the Pennine Way and other public footpaths. The walk starts from the Crowden car park which is located on the northern side of the Longdendale Reservoirs. From here it is a short stroll west to pick up the Pennine Way. Follow the waymarked trail north west and it will take you past Black Tor, Laddow Rocks, Black Chew Head, Near Broadslate, Red Ratcher, Meadowgrain Clough and Holme Edge before arriving at the Black Hill summit. This stands at a height of 582 metres (1,908 feet) and is the highest point of the historic county of Cheshire, lying at the tip of what was once known as the Cheshire Panhandle. The route then descends south to Tooleyshaw Moss, White Low, Westend Moss and Hey Edge before returning to the car park. This descent can be boggy after wet weather so you may want to just descend on the Pennine Way if you prefer.",
