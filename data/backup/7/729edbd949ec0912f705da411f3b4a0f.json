  "description": "This attractive Somerset based market town is well located with several waymarked footpaths heading into the countryside in all directions. The town itself is also an interesting place for a stroll with several noteworthy old buildings including the Market House, the Round House and the 15th century George Inn. This walk from the town heads south to visit the historic Cadbury Castle. The castle is one of the highlights of the area and can be reach on foot from the town on waymarked footpaths within a couple of hours. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the the Leland Trail and the Macmillan Way. You could also start from the train station just to the north of the town. These waymarked trails then head south through the countryside towards Galhampton, North Cadbury and South Cadbury before coming to the castle. The Iron Age hillfort is thought to be the site of King Arthur's Camelot. You can climb the hill for splendid views over the area. The route returns to the town on similar paths, save for using a section of the Monarch's Way which you can pick up around North Cadbury. This creates a circular loop on the route around the Galhampton area.",
