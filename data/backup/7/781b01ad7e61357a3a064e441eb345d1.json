Boots' Tower - also known as Boots' Folly - was built in the 1920's by Charles Boot (who owned the nearby Sugworth Hall), to keep his workmen employed during the depression. The interior was panelled and a wooden staircase gave access to the top room which had superb views across the surrounding countryside. The staircase was removed in the 1970's when an adventurous and nosey Cow became stuck at the top of the Tower."
