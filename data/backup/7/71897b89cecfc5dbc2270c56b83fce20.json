  "description": "This North Tyne town is a fine place for a historic coastal walk. There's splendid Georgian and Victorian architecture, an ancient priory and castle, and two lovely beaches to explore. This walk in the town takes you to the Spanish Battery and the Admiral Lord Collingworth Monument before heading out onto the North Pier for some great views of the town. You'll then explore Tynemouth Priory and Castle before heading along the coast to Sharpness Point, Long Sands, Tynemouth Park and North Point. You can start the walk from the Priory Haven Car Park or the Spanish Battery Car Park near the pier. Near the car parks you will also pass the Watch House Museum where you can learn all about the history of the local volunteer life brigade. Along the way there are splendid views of the dramatic castle ruins and the local beaches around Cullercoats Bay.",
