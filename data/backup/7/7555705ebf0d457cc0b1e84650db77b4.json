  "description": "Explore 560 acres of meadows and woodland in this large nature reserve on the slopes of the North Downs in Kent. The park is perfect for peaceful walks with a number of rare species of plant including meadow clary, rough mallow and six species of orchid to be seen. The park is located in Cuxton, just a short walk from Cuxton rail station. The North Downs Way passes through the park and is a great option for extending your walking in the area. Our Circular Walk around Cobham also passes near to the park. You could pick up the trail and visit Cobham Woods, Shorne Woods Country Park , Jeskyns Park and the bluebells in Ashenbank Wood .",
