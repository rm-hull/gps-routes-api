  "description": "This small cliff top village is located on the beautiful Ceredigion coast near St Dogmaels . This walk from the village takes you along the Ceredigion Coast Path with some fine sea views. You can start the walk from the car park and viewpoint just to the south of the village. The route then follows the coast road north towards the cliff hotel and the impressive rocks at Craig y Gwbert. Along the way there are some splendid views over the Teifi estuary and lots of wildife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for Bottlenose dolphins and porpoises\u00a0which can often be seen swimming in the bay, as can\u00a0grey seals\u00a0from the neighbouring\u00a0Cardigan Island\u00a0colony. There's a whole range of sea birds too with gannet,\u00a0razorbill,\u00a0guillemot,\u00a0Manx shearwater,\u00a0black-headed gull\u00a0and\u00a0fulmar to see. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Gwbert. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
