  "description": "This Essex based village includes some pleasant river trails, an unusual old wooden railway viaduct and a noteworthy ancient church. This circular walk from the village takes you west to link up with the Blackwater Rail Trail and visit the old viaduct over the River Blackwater. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths south west to St Peter's Church. This ancient church dates back to the 11th century and is a Grade II listed building. Near here you can pick up footpaths heading north along the river and the Blackwater Rail Trail, a shared cycling and walking path running along a disused railway line between Witham and Maldon. The route continues north east along the river, passing a weir before coming to Blue Mills Bridge. You then turn south to pass Sparkey Wood and return to the village.",
