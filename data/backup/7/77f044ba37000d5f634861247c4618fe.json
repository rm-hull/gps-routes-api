The interior features a single bar under a low, timbered ceiling, complemented by two cosy side rooms and a magnificent inglenook fireplace, complete with a sizeable wood-burning stove. On pleasant days, patrons can enjoy seating that overlooks the village green at the front, or opt for the spacious rear garden, which includes a covered, heated, and lit shelter for smokers. The pub enjoys popularity among both local residents and those who come specifically to dine. They are located at postcode GU27 3HY and the pub is dog friendly.
