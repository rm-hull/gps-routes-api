  "description": "This circular walk explores the area surrounding the hamlet of Hurdlow in the Peak District. Start the walk from the good sized Hurdlow car park near The Royal Oak pub. From here you can pick up the Pennine Bridleway and follow it north to visit Hurdlow Town and Hurdlow Grange. Continue west and you can enjoy a climb to High Wheeldon where you can enjoy some fine views over the surrounding hills. The route then descends south to Crowdecote before following a country lane east past High Needham to return to the car park. The High Peak Trail runs right past the car park so you can pick this up to continue your exercise. The shared cycling and walking trail runs along an old railway line from Cromford to Dowlow.",

The charming country pub sells high quality food and has a fine interior with timber beams and cosy fires. Outside there's also an attractive garden and a campsite if you'd like to stay in the area. You can find them at postcode SK17 9QJ. In Crowdecote there's the noteworthy Packhorse Inn. The inn dates back to the 16th century when it served as a stop off point from the packhorse trail from Newcastle Under Lyme to Hassop, near Bakewell. There's a charming old interior and a garden area with fine views of the valley."
