  "description": "This traffic free cycle and walking path runs along a disused railway line from Heathfield to the outskirts of Eastbourne. The trail follows National Cycle Route 21 for about 14 miles and runs through a mixture of woodland, grassland and countryside with a variety of interesting sculptures lining the way. It begins in the East Sussex market town of Heathfield and finishes near the beautiful coastline at Eastbourne. For wildlife lovers there is plenty to look out for along the trail including different species of butterflies such as the orange-tip. Also look out for various birdlife including bullfinch, lesser whitethroat and cuckoos of course (The trail obtained its name from the tradition that the first cuckoo in Spring was heard at the Heathfield Fair). The trail is easily accessible with train stations at Polegate and Hampden Park. It is also a nice easy, safe route ideal for families.",
