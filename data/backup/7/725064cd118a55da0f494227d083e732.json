  "description": "Follow the Monsal Trail through the Peak District National Park on this cycling and walking path. The trail follows a disused railway line from Chee Dale near Buxton to Bakewell with the first section following the River Wye to Monsal Head via Cressbrook Dale and Miller's Dale. This popular beauty spot includes shady wooded valleys, rushing rivers and lots of interesting flora and fauna. At Monsal Head you will pass over the impressive Headstone Viaduct, built in 1836. The second section runs onto Bakewell passing Great Longstone with more stunning views to enjoy. You can virtually explore the route using google street view link below!",
