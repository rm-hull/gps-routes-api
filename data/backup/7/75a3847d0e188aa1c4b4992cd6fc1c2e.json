  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around the expansive Canford Heath on this route in Poole. The heathland has miles of good walking trails with interesting flora and fauna to see. The walk starts from the Gravel Hill Car Park located near Poole Grammar School and the Crematorium on Gravel Hill Road (postcode BH17 9BJ). The car park holds about 10 cars and provides easy access to the footpaths on the heath. The route heads east from here along a shared cycling and walking path running along the southern side of the heath. You'll pass Lodge Hill before coming to the Knighton Golf Heath Club near Alderney. The route then turns north east towards Eastlands Farm where there are some nice woodland trails at the northern fringes of the heath. You then turn south past a pond before following Longfleet Drive back towards the car park. The 850 acre site is also a nature reserve so keep your eyes peeled for wildlife including Dartford warbler and Nightjar.",
