  "description": "This large area of heathland is located just to the south west of the town of Royston in Hertfordshire. Also known as Therfield Heath it's a good sized area of common land on which sheep are still regularly grazed. The heath is in an elevated position, with some small hill climbs and great views over the Cam Valley countryside. Therfield Hill is the high point at 168 m (551 ft), with a water tower sitting on the summit. This circular walk starts from the car park off the Baldock Road, just west of Royston. From here you can pick up the trails heading west towards Jubilee Wood and the Fox Covert Nature Reserve. You then pass Church Hill before returning to the car park on different trails on the northern side of the heath. On the walk look out for several bronze age round barrows and lots of pretty wildflowers in the spring and summer months. Also look out for wildlife including the Chalkhill Blue butterfly fluttering around the flowers. Both the Hertfordshire Way and the Icknield Way Path cross the heath. You can pick up either of these long distance, waymarked trails to continue your walking around Royston. You could follow the Icknield Way Path south, for example, to visit the village of Therfield itself.",
