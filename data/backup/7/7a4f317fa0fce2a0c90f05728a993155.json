  "description": "This is a nice easy climb to try from Waterhead in Ambleside. It takes you from the northern end of Lake Windermere to a viewpoint overlooking the lake. There's a footpath near to the bus stop on the A591 which is signed for Jenkin's Crag. You climb toward Skelghyll Wood where you pick up woodland trails to the viewpoint. Here you can enjoy great views over the lake to the surrounding mountains. It's a short walk of about 0.5 miles and a nice one to do if you are staying in Waterhead or if you've got half an hour to spare before catching a bus from Waterhead! The walk also passes the pretty Stagshaw Gardens. The gardens are owned by the National Trust and include a lovely collection of shrubs, plants and flowers including rhododendrons, azaleas and camellias.",
