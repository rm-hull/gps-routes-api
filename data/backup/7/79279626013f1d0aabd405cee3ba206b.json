  "description": "This pretty village in South Devon is in a great location for coastal walking. This circular walk visits the neighbouring village of Noss Mayo before exploring the lovely Gara Point Yealm Estuary using a section of the long distance South West Coast Path. Starting in the village you cross the Newton Creek on the ferry to Noss Mayo. From here you can follow footpaths south to Blackstone Point. Here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it to Gara Point. It's a lovely spot with wildflowers, green fields, gorse and wonderful views to Wembury Bay, Plymouth Sound and the Mewstone. The route continues north east along the coast path back towards Noss Mayo and the ferry crossing. To continue your walking in the area you can head west to the village of Wembury and then on to Wembury Point. It's a splendid area with spectacular coastal cliffs and a variety of wildlife. You can look out for Dartmoor Ponies, basking sharks, porpoises, dolphins and many different types of birds from this stretch of coast. If you were to head east you would soon come to the beautiful Erme Estuary .",
