Dating from the dark ages it is thought to have still been occupied until post Roman times. There are extensive and scenic views in all directions. This stone lies on the southern ramparts and the hole in this socket stone is approx. 10 inches in diameter and shows signs of chisel marks. However, its purpose remains a mystery. The village of Bridge of Earn and the M90 Motorway can be seen in the distance."

  "description": "This large area of woodland near Perth has miles of nice walking trails and some moderate hill climbs to try. There's lots to see including a nice family sculpture trail. Here you'll find pieces including dragonflies, swinging bees, a wooden bench shaped like a slug and a deer made of metal. There's also lots of wildlife to see on the site. Look out for birds such as great-spotted woodpecker and buzzard, as you make your way through the woods. You can start the walk from the parking area at Wallacetown Wood at the eastern end of the woods. From here you can pick up the woodland footpaths heading west up to Moncrieffe Hill. The summit area, which is known as Moredun Top, is clear and provides fine views over Perth and the Firth of Tay. The route then follows other paths to an Iron Age hill fort and Tarsappie Hill before returning to the car park. To continue your walking in the Perth area head to the nearby Scone Palace. There's miles of nice trails to try around the extensive grounds and beautiful gardens here.",
