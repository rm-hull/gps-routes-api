  "description": "This Lancashire town has some nice canal trails, a local country park, several reservoirs and a significant hill to visit. This walk from the town visits some of the local highlights including the Leeds and Liverpool Canal the Darwen Tower and Sunnyhurst Woods. The walk starts from Blackburn train station where it's just a short stroll to the canal. You can then pick up the towpath and follow it south west through Lower Audley, Grimshaw Park, Nova Scotia, Moorgate and Mill Hill. Around here you leave the canal to pick up the Witton Weavers Way which you can follow south towards Tockholes. In this area you could take a short detour to the south to visit the pretty Roddlesworth Reservoir. This route heads past Earnsdale Reservoir before climbing to the Darwen or Jubilee Tower. You can climb the tower for wonderful views of the Bowland Fells, North Yorkshire, Morecambe Bay, Blackpool Tower, the Lake District and the Isle of Man. Near the foot of the hill you can also pay a visit to Bold Venture Park. After taking in the views the route descends to Sunnyhurst Wood. Follow the woodland trails through the woods and you will emerge in Darwen where you can walk through the town to the train station. Here you can catch the train back to Blackburn.",
