  "description": "This Kent based village is located in the borough of Tonbridge and Malling near West Malling. Local walking highlights include the expansive Mereworth Woods where there are miles of woodland trails to try. To the north there's Manor Park Country Park in the neighbouring village of West Malling. On the eastern side of the village there's the Warren Woods Nature Park where you can explore some local ancient woodland. It's great for wildlife including badgers, foxes, bats, dormouse, as well as many woodland birds, reptiles and insects, including a variety of butterflies and bees. This walk starts in the village and takes you east to explore the park where you can find pretty bluebells in the spring. The village also includes a number of greenways suitable for walking or cycling.",
