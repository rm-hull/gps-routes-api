  "description": "This coastal walk takes you from Herne Bay to Reculver, passing through Reculver Country Park. It's just over 3 miles on a flat path with a short climb as you approach Reculver. On the way you will pass Beltinge Cliff and Bishopstones Nature Reserve where you can look out for wildlife including sand martins,  skylarks,\u00a0meadow pipits\u00a0and\u00a0corn buntings. The walk starts on the front in Herne Bay, near to the pier and the main parking area. Around here you can also see the Clock Tower built in 1837. It is believed to be one of the earliest purpose-built, free-standing\u00a0clock towers\u00a0in the United Kingdom. Follow the coast path east to Beltinge where you will pass the first cliffs east of London.\u00a0You continue past Bishopstone to Reculver Country Park where there are splendid sea views and a wide variety of wildlife and plantlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for\u00a0sanderlings, turnstones, fulmars and curlews in this area. At the eastern end of the park you will find two interesting historical sites. Firstly there is St Mary's Church which includes the two medieval towers which are a major local landmark. There's also Regulbium where you will find the remains of an ancient\u00a0Roman\u00a0fort. In the village you will find a cafe and pub where you can enjoy refreshments at the end of your walk. The route uses a section of the Saxon Shore Way long distance trail so there is scope for extending your walk. You could head west on the popular Whitstable to Herne Bay Walk or east to visit Birchington and Margate .",
