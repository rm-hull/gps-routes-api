  "description": "Go fossil hunting on Charmouth beach and enjoy wonderful views of the Jurassic Coast on this walk in Dorset. This circular walk starts from the Charmouth Beach car park where you can gain access to the beach and search for fossils. The route then makes use of two long distance trails to take you along the beautiful stretch of coast. You first head east along the Monarch's Way to Stonebarrow Hill before returning along Stonebarrow Lane along the South West Coast Path. You can then finish the walk with a stroll through the pretty village of Charmouth before returning to the car park. The walk includes some wonderful cliff top scenery, beautiful beaches and a range of interesting flora and fauna. There are also nice views of the River Char which you'll cross twice at the start and end of the walk. Charmouth can also be reached on foot from Lyme Regis by following the South West Coast Path east for about 2 miles. You can also extend your walk by heading east along the coast to the splendid Golden Cap Estate. The Lyme Regis to Charmouth circular walk visits the fascinating cliffs at Black Ven and the Lyme Regis Golf Club.",

Next to the cafe there's also the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre where you can see a wonderful fossil collection including an ichthyosaur that starred in the BBC documentary \u2018Attenborough and the Sea Dragon\u2019. There's also guided fossil hunting walks to try here. If you fancy a pub lunch head into the village and visit the Royal Oak. They serve a great Sunday Roast and can be found at a postcode of DT6 6PE for your sat navs."

The walk visits historic old hill forts where you can enjoy some stunning views over the countryside of the Marshwood Vale. Just to the east there's the climb to the lovely viewpoint at Colmers Hill from the picturesque village of Symondsbury. The historic village includes an ancient church and a noteworthy 15th century, thatched pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Dorset Walks page."
