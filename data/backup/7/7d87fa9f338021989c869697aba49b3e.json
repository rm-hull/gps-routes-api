  "description": "This circular walk from Pentney Lakes visits West Bilney Wood, Shouldham Warren Nature Reserve and the riverside village of Narborough. The lakes are located near King's Lynn and offer a holiday retreat with fishing and easy walking trails. Start the walk at the car park at the western end of the site. You can then follow trails around the lakes before heading north to West Bilney Wood. After exploring the woods the route then heads south to visit Shouldham Warren. In the reserve you'll find beautiful pine woodlands and fine views across the fenland countryside and the Nar Valley. There's also two colour coded walks to try. The route then retraces its steps to join with the Nar Valley Way. You can follow the River Nar east to Narborough where there's the pretty Narford Lake and a historic church. The route then heads west, passing Pentney village before returning to the car park.",
