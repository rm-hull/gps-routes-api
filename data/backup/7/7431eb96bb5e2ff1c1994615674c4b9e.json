  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Keeper Hill in the Silvermine Mountains of County Tipperary. You can start the walk from the Keeper Hill Trail car park, west of the hill. Then pick up the waymarked Ballyhourigan Wood Loop Walk to take you north and then east to the hill. The woodland trails will take you towards the hill where you ascend to a height of 694 metres (2,277 ft). From here there are some splendid views to enjoy. The forest and hill have some good mountain bike trails as well - see the video below for an idea of the terrain around the hill. See the wikipedia page for more details.",
