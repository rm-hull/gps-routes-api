  "description": "These expansive woods in the Howardian Hills have mountain bike trails and a series of footpaths to try. The woods are quite hilly on the north western side so there's good opportunities for some fast descents for cyclists. There's also good wide footpaths leading to a large picturesque pond and a couple of smaller ponds. Look out for a variety of woodland birds as you make your way along the paths. The woods are located just a mile to the east of the Foss Walk long distance trail. You could pick this up near Oulston to extend your walking in the area. A couple of miles east of the forest you can pick up the Ebor Way at Cawton. The Nunnington and the River Rye walk is also nearby and a great way to explore the Ryedale area of the Howardian Hills.",
