  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Moray Coast Trail from Buckie to Cullen via Findochty. The route runs for just over 7 miles along a fairly flat waymarked footpath. There are some small cliff tops climbs along the way though. There's much to enjoy with lovely beaches and some splendid coastal rock formations. The walk starts from the public car park at Seatown in Buckie. Follow the trail north east and it will take you past Cluny Harbour and Gordonsburgh. You'll then pass along the scenic Portessie Bay and the pretty beach at Strathlene Sands. You continue along the Strathlene Golf Course to Craig Head and Findochty where there are some fine views over Spey Bay. The next section runs to Portknockie via Tronach Head. Here you can admire the natural stone arch at Bow Fiddle Rock, a popular place for a photograph. The final leg takes you along the beautiful Cullen Bay and beach to Cullen where the route finishes. For more details on this final section of the walk see the Cullen to Portknockie Walk page where there's more photos and a video.",
