  "description": "This circular walk takes you along a particularly beautiful section of the Cotswold Way National Trail visiting Leckhampton Hill and Hartley Hill. The walk starts at a parking area next to the A435 about three miles south of the centre of Cheltenham. From here you can pick up the Cotswold Way and follow the track to Charlton Kings Common and Hartley Hill. You cross the hill to to the Devil\u2019s Chimney, an iconic Cotswold landmark. This unusual limestone rock formation stands above a disused quarry in Leckhampton. It's a picturesque spot with fabulous countryside views providing a wonderful backdrop to the chimney. The area of Leckhampton Hill and Charlton Kings Common is a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Key Wildlife Site. Look out for a variety of interesting flora and fauna such as meadow pipit and grasshopper warbler. Rare plants include fly orchid, musk orchid and purple milk-vetch. The walk finishes with a stroll along a country lane which leads back to the start point. If you would like to extend your walk then you could continue along the Cotswold Way to the delightful Crickley Hill Country Park .",
