The woods are most well known for\u00a0paranormal\u00a0activity including\u00a0several UFO\u00a0sightings. They also have some nice public footpaths to follow through the woods. The woods are surrounded by some lovely Sussex countryside and have bluebells growing in the spring. There's parking available at the south western corner of the woods.",
