  "description": "This County Durham based village has lots of nice waterside trails along the River Wear and the Bollihope Burn which run through the area. It is also accessible on the heritage Weardale Railway, a popular tourist highlight of the local area. This circular walk explores the area to the south of the village, visiting the Frosterley Quarries and the River Wear. The walk starts in the village centre, following footpaths south to cross the river. You then head south west past the quarries to link up with the Weardale Way around Low Bishopley. Follow the waymarked trail east and it will take you past the waterfalls and caves around Wise Eel Bridge on the Bollihope Burn. The route then heads past Broadwood before linking up with the river path to take you back into Frosterley.",
