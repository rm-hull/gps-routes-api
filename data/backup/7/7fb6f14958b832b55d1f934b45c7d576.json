  "description": "This walk visits the Larpool Viaduct near Whitby in North Yorkshire. The impressive 13 arch structure was built in 1882 to carry the Scarborough & Whitby Railway over the River Esk. It's a worthy walk from the town, with nice views to be had from the top of the viaduct. The walk starts from the train station and heads south to the viaduct. It's about a 1 mile walk from the station to the structure which you can cross, over the Esk, on a footpath. From the elevated position of the viaduct there are nice views over the countryside to the town of Whitby. After crossing the viaduct you can follow the Cinder Track to Stainsacre, where you can stop for refreshments at the cafe before turning around. On the way you'll also pass the Larpool Hall Hotel. It was built in the late 1780s and was a private residence for about two centuries. It is now a hotel which provides accommodation and a sociable bar. The hotel includes 14 acres of attractive grounds and views over the Esk Valley.",
