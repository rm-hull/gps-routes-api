  "description": "This pretty East Sussex village is located in a lovely spot in the High Weald AONB near Rye. This circular walk makes use of some of the waymarked long distance trails running through the surrounding area. You'll follow sections of the High Weald Landscape Trail, the Sussex Border Path and the Royal Military Canal Path to visit the neighbouring settlements of Rye and Iden. On the way there are nice waterside sections along the River Rother and the canal near Rye. There's also some peaceful woodland paths through Iden Wood, views of the River Tillingham valley and some lovely surrounding High Weald countryside to enjoy. At the southern end of the route you can extend your outing by visiting the coastal Camber Sands or exploring the wildlife rich Rye Harbour Nature Reserve.",
