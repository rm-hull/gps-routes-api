  "description": "This circular walk takes you along the South West Coast Path to two noteable highlights on the Jurassic Coast . The beautiful Kimmeridge Bay is part of the Purbeck Marine Wildlife Reserve. On the beach you will find a number of rock-pools where you can look out for a variety of marine wildlife.\u00a0 From here you can head east along the South West Coast Path to the lovely Chapman's Pool. The walk passes Clavell Tower and Egmont Point where there is a pretty waterfall. From Chapman's Pool the return leg climbs through the countryside above Kimmeridge. You'll pass Smedmore Hill and Swyre Head before returning to Kimmeridge. The views on this elevated section of the coast and countryside are simply stunning. Just to the west of Kimmeridge you will find the Lulworth Range Walks . The military owned area is only open to the public at certain times (most weekends). There are some lovely walking trails here with climbs to Povington Hill (191 m) and the range's highest point, Ridgeway Hill (199 m) with fabulous views over the Purbeck Hills and the coastline. The area includes the deserted village of Tyneham . The village was abandoned during the second world war when all the residents were told to leave so the area could be used for military training. Today you can enjoy a stroll around the ruined buildings and visit the associated museum. You can also reach the bay by following The Hardy Way from Wareham or Corfe Castle.",
