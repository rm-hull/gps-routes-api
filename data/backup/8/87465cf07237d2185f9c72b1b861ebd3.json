  "description": "Explore over 114 acres of woodland, heathland, grassland and lakes on this circular walk through the peaceful Stover Country Park, near Newton Abbot in Devon. The walk takes you around the delightful Stover Lake before following the canal outlet through the woodland. The park also includes the Ted Hughes Poetry Trail which takes in specially designed Poetry Posts each displaying a poem by Ted Hughes on a theme relating to wildlife of the natural world. The route below is designed for walkers but there is also a designated cycle route through the northern part of the Park. The Templer Way runs through the park so you could pick this up to continue your walk. Heading north would take you to Bovey Tracey while heading south would take you along the Stover Canal to Newton Abbot. Our Newton Abbot Walk starts from the town and takes you to the park on this route.",
