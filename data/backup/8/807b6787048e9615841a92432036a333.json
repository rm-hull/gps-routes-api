  "description": "Follow the Selby Canal from the Yorkshire town of Selby to West Haddlesey on this nice waterside walk. The canal runs for 6 miles, linking the River Ouse in Selby with the River Aire in West Haddlesey. It's a very pleasant walk with locks, barges and nice tree lined footpaths on the way. There's also good views of the surrounding Yorkshire countryside for much of the route. The walk starts just east of the train station where you can pick up the Trans Pennine Trail and follow it south along the canal. The shared cycling and walking trail takes you past Westfield and Oakney Wood. The trail continues past Brayton, Burn Bridge and Burton Bridge before coming into West Haddlesey where the canal joins with the River Aire. If you'd like to continue your walking around Selby you could head to the nearby Skipwith Common. There's lots of nice trails here with the added bonus of Exmoor ponies and a herd of wild deer to look out for. The common is located just a few miles north east of the town centre.",
