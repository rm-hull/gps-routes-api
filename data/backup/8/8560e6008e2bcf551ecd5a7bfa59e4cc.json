  "description": "This challenging circular walk from Patterdale climbs to this prominent fell on the north-eastern ridge of Fairfield. The circular walk climbs to Birks Fell and then onto the 841 m (2,759 ft) of St Sunday Crag. There's fabulous views of the Helvellyn range, High Street and the lake below. The walk takes place on generally good footpaths on a splendid elevated ridge. You can start your walk from the pretty village of Patterdale at the southern end of Ullswater Lake. Then follow the trail south west out of the village to Birks Fell before climbing across St Sunday Crag. You then descend to the pretty Grisedale Tarn before turning round and returning to Patterdale via Grisedale Forest and Patterdale Common. To extend your walking in the area you could visit the lovely Aira Force Waterfall. The long distance Ullswater Way will take you on a tour of the area surrounding the lake. Wainwright's Coast to Coast runs through the area so you could continue along the path past Grisedale Tarn towards Seat Sandal where there are more splendid views.",

It's said that Wordsworth was in the bar as news arrived that Nelson had died at Trafalgar in 1805. The interior is full of old world charm while outside there's a nice beer garden just across the road. It's a lovely place to relax and soak in the fine views if the weather is good. You can find the pub in the village at postcode CA11 0NW for your sat navs."

Around Ullswater Lake there's lots more good walking opportunities. You could try the Glenridding to Aira Force Walk and visit a wonderful waterfall and woodland area. The Howtown to Glenridding Walk can also be picked up in nearby Glenridding. The easy trail follows the lakeshore to Howtown Pier where the Ullswater Steamer boats dock. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lake District Walks page."
