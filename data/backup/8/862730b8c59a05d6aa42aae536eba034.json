  "description": "This pleasant circular walk in the town of Chester-le-Street visits the riverside gardens and Lumley Castle. You can start the walk from the parking area at the riverside park, just to the east of the city centre. You could also start from the train station and walk a short distance through the town to the river. In the pretty park there are wildflower meadows, sculptures, artist-designed ornamental gardens, a cafe and nice riverside footpaths. After exploring the park, cross Lumley Bridge and pick up the Weardale Way which will take you along the River Wear to Lumley Castle. The impressive 14th-century quadrangular castle is now a hotel where you could enjoy a nice cream tea before continuing your walk. After leaving the castle the route heads through the golf course to return to the river and the finish point at the car park.",
