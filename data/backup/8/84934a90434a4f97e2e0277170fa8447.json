  "description": "This pretty little village in Buckinghamshire sits close to the River Thames and a lovely local nature reserve. The village is very attractive with picturesque cottages, a 14th century church and a 16th century pub for refreshment after you walk. This circular walk takes you around the Spade Oak Nature Reserve which lies just to the south of the settlement. The pretty reserve includes a lake which attracts a variety of birdlife. Along the former gravel pit there are also some pleasant woodland trails. You can follow footpaths around the lake leading you down to the railway line and the Thames Path where you can enjoy a riverside stroll along a nice grassy path. You can extend the walk by heading west along the river to visit Marlow. Heading east will take you to Bourne End and Cookham where you can visit the National Trust's Cliveden House .",
