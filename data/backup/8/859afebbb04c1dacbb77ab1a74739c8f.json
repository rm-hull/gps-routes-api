  "description": "This cycling and walking route follows National Cycle Route 7 from Callander to Strathyre along Loch Lubnaig. It's a great traffic free path, running for just over 9 miles along the Garbh Uisge river before heading through the woodland of Queen Elizabeth Forest Park alongside the loch. The route finishes at the little village of Strathyre at the northern end of the water. It's a lovely area with the beautiful loch surrounded by attractive forestry and the mountains of the Trossachs. You'll also pass the wonderful Falls of Leny at the Callander end of the loch. The loch is popular with fishermen while canoes can be rented at the north end. Car parks are available at the southern end of the water. It's easy to extend your cycling and walking in this beautiful area. You could head a few miles west of Callander and visit Loch Venachar and Loch Drunkie. . If you are looking for a more challenging walk then you could climb to Ben Ledi for fabulous views back down to the loch.",
