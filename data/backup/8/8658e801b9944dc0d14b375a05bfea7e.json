  "description": "Riverhead is located on the north western side of Sevenoaks in Kent. This circular walk from the village uses part of the Darent Valley Path and other public footpaths to visit the Sevenoaks Wildlife Reserve , the neighbouring village of Otford and Chipstead Lake . The nature reserve is located just east of the village and has some pretty lakes and lots of wildlife to see. Along the way you can enjoy lovely views of the River Darent and the surrounding Kent countryside. In attractive Otford you can also pay a visit to the ruins of the 15th century Otford Palace. The principal surviving remains are the North-West Tower, the lower gallery, now converted to cottages, and a part of the Great Gatehouse.",
