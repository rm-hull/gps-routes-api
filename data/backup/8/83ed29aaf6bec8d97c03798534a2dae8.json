  "description": "Enjoy riverside paths, waterfalls and moderate climbs on this walk around the North Yorkshire village of Askrigg. It's a figure of eight walk but you could complete as two separate circular walks if you prefer. The walk starts in the pretty village of Askrigg with its cobbled streets and old church. The village has become notable through its role as the fictional Darrowby in the BBC TV series All Creatures Great and Small. The western part of the walk visits the waterfalls near the village including Mill Gill and Whitfield Force Waterfalls. On this section there's some nice woodland trails along the rushing waters of Whitfield Gill and Paddock Beck. There's also some good climbs with great views across Wensleydale from the high points. On the eastern section of the walk there's some lovely riverside footpaths along the River Ure to enjoy. The walk heads along the river to Nappa Mill before returning to the village through the countryside, passing Askrigg Beck on the way. The long distance Herriot Way runs through the village. It takes you through areas of the Yorkshire Dales associated with the vet and author James Herriot. You can pick it up to extend your walking in this lovely area. If you head west you can visit Hardraw Force and Hawes. Follow it east and you can visit the splendid Aysgarth Falls .",

      "content": "Just a few miles to the south there's a lovely circular walk to try around Semer Water. The beautiful lake is notable as the second largest natural lake in North Yorkshire, England after Malham Tarn. Near here there's also the worthy village of Bainbridge. The village includes views of the River Bain and a 15th century hotel which is one of the oldest in Yorkshire. The circular Garsdale Walk starts from the nearby Garsdale train station on the Settle and Carlisle Line. It's a beautiful place with trails along the Grisedale Beck and more pretty waterfalls to see. The area lies just a few miles to the north west of Hardraw. Near here there's also the noteworthy Uldale Force. This impressive waterfall is located in a striking limestone gorge on the River Rawthey. There's also a series of smaller waterfalls so the area is well worth a visit especially after rainfall. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks page."
