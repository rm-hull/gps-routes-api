The former deer park of the house, known as \"Cricket Park\", were designed by D.D (David) Davis, a noted horticulturist at the start of the 19th Century, and were later turned into a wildlife park shown here. At its peak the park was home to 600 rare and endangered species including lemurs, primates, camels, reptiles and wildfowl. The wildlife park closed in 2009 and most of the larger animals were moved to other zoos around the country. Some of the smaller animals, such as the lemurs, were kept and the park was returned to gardens and lakes, re-opening in mid-2010. The park has since closed again and very little remains of the enclosures or buildings."

You can enjoy afternoon tea in the tea rooms and sit outside and enjoy the splendid views of the gardens and surrounding Somerset countryside. Cricket St Thomas is located just a few miles east of Chard. The Liberty Trail runs just south of the park so you could pick this up if you wanted to continue your walk. The trail will soon lead you to the nearby Wayford Woods . The delightful woods include  streams, a lake, Rhododendrons and bluebells in the spring months. They are well worth a visit after exploring the park if you have time. The park is also located near to the historic Forde Abbey . Here you will find a historic Cistercian monastery with 30 acres of award winning gardens to explore.",
