  "description": "The town of Stockport is located to the south of Manchester. There's some nice riverside trails along the rivers that run through the town. There's also some good local parks with surfaced footpaths to try. This walk takes you west from the town along the River Mersey to East Didsbury where you can visit the lovely botanic gardens at Fletcher Moss Park. The walk starts in the town centre next to the bus station where you can pick up the Trans Pennine Trail. Follow the waymarked trail west and it will soon bring you to the River Mersey where you can pick up a footpath running alongside the river. Continue west and the path will take you to Cheadle Bridge and East Didsbury passing a riverside farm and the Mersey Vale Nature Park on the way. There's some interesting flora and fauna here and a picturesque spot by the rushing weir. At the Didsbury golf club you leave the river. Head north and it will take you to Fletcher Moss Park where there is a botanic garden with a fine display of flowers and a little waterfall. Also near here is Parsonage gardens where you will find several large yew trees and pretty flower beds. After exploring the gardens you can return to Stockport on the same paths or catch the train/bus back from East Didsbury.",

They have a cosy interior with real fires and good home cooked food. Outside there's a good sized garden area if the weather is fine. It's located in a nice spot next to the marketplace at postcode SK1 2LX for your sat navs. At the end of the route Ye Olde Cock Inn and the Didsbury pub are located next to Fletcher Moss park. They both have a good menu and outdoor seating for finer weather."

There's nice trails here taking you around the parkland and gardens with views towards the Peak District hills from the high points. You can also pick up the Midshires Way here and enjoy a riverside stroll along the River Goyt. If you continue west along the river then you could visit Wythenshawe Park where there's an old hall and a community farm. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
