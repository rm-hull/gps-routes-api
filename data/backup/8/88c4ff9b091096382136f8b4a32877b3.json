  "description": "The town of Stockport is located to the south of Manchester. There's some nice riverside trails along the rivers that run through the town. There's also some good local parks with surfaced footpaths to try. This walk takes you west from the town along the River Mersey to East Didsbury where you can visit the lovely botanic gardens at Fletcher Moss Park . The walk starts in the town centre next to the bus station where you can pick up the Trans Pennine Trail . Follow the waymarked trail west and it will soon bring you to the River Mersey where you can pick up a footpath running alongside the river. Continue west and the path will take you to Cheadle Bridge and East Didsbury passing a riverside farm and the Mersey Vale Nature Park on the way. There's some interesting flora and fauna here and a picturesque spot by the rushing weir. At the Didsbury golf club you leave the river. Head north and it will take you to Fletcher Moss Park where there is a botanic garden with a fine display of flowers and a little waterfall. Also near here is Parsonage gardens where you will find several large yew trees and pretty flower beds. After exploring the gardens you can return to Stockport on the same paths or catch the train/bus back from East Didsbury.",
