  "description": "This walk from the town takes you along the River Slea to the neighbouring villages of Anwick and South Kyme. It's about a 9 mile walk along a flat waterside footpath. On the way you'll pass a series of old bridges and locks with nice views of the surrounding Lincolnshire countryside. The walk starts in Sleaford just to the north east of the train station. From here you can pick up the river path and follow it north east towards Anwick, passing Haverholme Priory and Wood on the way. The present priory ruin is the remains of a Gothic building built around 1835 to designs by the architect\u00a0Henry Edward Kendall. This was a rebuild of an earlier house dating from 1780. The ruins are now a Grade II\u00a0listed building\u00a0and designated\u00a0Ancient Monument You continue east, passing Ewerby Waithe Common before arriving in the village of South Kyme. The village is very pretty with the Kyme Eau stream running through it. There's a nice footpath running along this picturesque waterway in both directions. You'll also pass South Kyme Tower, the remains of a 14th-century castle.",
