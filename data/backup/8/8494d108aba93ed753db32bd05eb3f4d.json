  "description": "This pretty North Welsh village sits in a fine spot at the confluence of the Rivers Tanat and Eirth. It is located at the foot of the stunning Berwyn Mountains with some fine walking trails to try. The surrounding area is often coined the Welsh Lake District with Bala Lake, Lake Vyrnwy and Llyn Celyn all nearby. This circular walk from the village climbs to Y Gribin before heading to the old quarries at Craig Rhiwarth. The scenery is very beautiful with great views of the Tanat Valley from the high points. For a more challenging walk in the area head just a few miles north east to climb to Cadair Berwyn, the highest point in the Berwyn Mountains. Near here there's also the beautiful Pistyll Rhaeadr, another of the highlights of the immediate area.",
