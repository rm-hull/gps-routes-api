  "description": "The area surrounding the market town of Mansfield has some excellent choices for walkers. There's fine woodland trails in the nearby Sherwood Forest, several country parks, riverside trails and a pretty reservoir on the outskirts of the town. This short walk visits Titchfield Park, Kings Mill Reservoir and the River Maun which runs through the town. You'll pass old mills and pretty nature reserves with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The route starts just to the south of the train station in Titchfield Park. It's a lovely place for a stroll with riverside paths and a nice cafe. Follow the paths west past St Mark's Church where you pick up the Quarry Lane Walkway and the Timberland Trail. The trail runs along the train line before coming to Kings Mill Reservoir . The site includes an excellent visitor centre and a nice walking trail to follow around the perimeter of the water. There's also lots of wildfowl to look out for on the water. To continue your walking in the Mansfield area you can pick up the Robin Hood Way long distance footpath in Harlow Wood, just to the south of the town. The trail will take you to many of the highlights of the area including the splendid Sherwood Pines Forest Park and the fascinating Augustinian priory at Newstead Abbey . Near Sherwood Pines you can also visit Vicar Water Country Park where there are nice trails around the two lakes. Just to the north west of the town you will find the Teversal Trail . This shared cycling and walking trail uses disused colliery lines to form a circular route around the villages of Teversal and Skegby. It visits Pleasley Pit Country Park , Pleasley Vale and Silverhill Wood Country Park , where you can climb to the highest point of Nottinghamshire. Burntstump Country Park , Blidworth Woods and Rufford Country Park are also near the town and have miles of woodland trails to try.",
