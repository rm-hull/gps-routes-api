  "description": "Enjoy a wonderful coastal hike from Bridlington to Flamborough Head on the North York Moors coast. It's a great cliff top section of the path with large numbers of seabirds to look out for on the way. The route runs for a distance of about 6 miles so 12 miles there and back. Starting at the harbour at Bridlington you head north along North Sands to Sewerby. Here you will pass the Grade I listed\u00a0Georgian\u00a0country house of Sewerby Hall. You could take a detour from the route to visit the hall and enjoy the splendid 50 acre landscaped gardens. The route continues past the wooded valley of Dane's Dyke before coming to the impressive cliffs at South Landing. Here you can enjoy a nice picnic area and a number of interesting sculptures. The final section takes you past the South Landing Lifeboat station before coming to Flamborough Head . It's a fabulous spot with a number of large sea stacks, wonderfull cliffs, pretty bays and the oldest surviving lighthouse in Britain. The area is also designated as a nature reserve so look out for large seabird colonies including auks, gannets and gulls. The East Riding Heritage Way passes through Flamborough Head so you could continue along this path to the nearby Bempton Cliffs where you can see more seabirds.",
