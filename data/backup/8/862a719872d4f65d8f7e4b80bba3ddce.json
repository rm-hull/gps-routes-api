  "description": "This riverside town is located in the borough of\u00a0Tonbridge and Malling\u00a0in\u00a0Kent. It's an historic place with Tudor Mulberry Cottages on the High Street and a church dating to the 12th century. This walk from Snodland train station visits the Holborough Marshes Nature Reserve . The reserve is located next to the River Medway and includes grazing marsh with lots of wildfowl to look out for. It's a nice place for a stroll with good views across the river to the surrounding countryside. Keep your eyes peeled for nightingales and a variety of dragonflies in the summer months. To continue your walking around Snodland you could head to neighbouring Aylesford where there's some fine riverside walks, an old priory, a medieval castle and the splendid Museum of Kent Life to visit. Just to the east there's Blue Bell Hill where you can enjoy some wonderful views over the town and the surrounding North Downs countryside. To the south is Leybourne Lakes Country Park where there's some fine waterside cycling and walking routes to try.",
