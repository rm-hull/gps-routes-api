  "description": "This attractive village in Northamptonshire is famous for being the location for the planning of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. The historic settlement is located close to the larger towns of Rugby and Daventry in the western part of the county. This route from Ashby St Ledgers uses sections of the Jurassic Way and the Grand Union Canal Walk to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. You'll visit the neighbouring settlements of Braunston and Welton while enjoying some fine countryside views. There's also a long canalside section which will take you to the Braunston Tunnel and Drayton Reservoir . The walk can be extended at the southern end by visiting the lovely Daventry Country Park where you can enjoy waterside walks around the pretty reservoir.",
