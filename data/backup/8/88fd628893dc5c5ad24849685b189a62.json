  "description": "This spectacular coastal causeway in Northern Ireland has a unique polygonal landscape feature. In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers, the Giant's Causeway was named as the fourth greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom. The geological features include the 'Organ' where huge columns of basalt resemble Organ Pipes. You'll also pass the the Giant's Boot and a natural stone throne known as the Wishing Chair. You can also climb the 167 Shepherd's Steps for wonderful views across the coast. The is also a nature reserve so look out for a variety of flora and fauna including many species of plants, fungi, lichen, birds, spiders, beetles and butterflies. The walk starts at the excellent National Trust Visitor Centre where you will find a wealth of information and a good sized car park. You then follow footpaths past the headland of Great Stookan, Port Granny, Grand Causeway and Port Noffer. The walk returns via the Organ and the Giant's Chair. The walk can be extended by continuing along the North Antrim Coast Path towards Dunseverick. If you would like to visit the causeway by bike then National Cycle Network Route 93 runs to the site along the fantastic Causeway Coast Cycle Route. You can pick up the trail from Castle Rock, Portrush or Bushmills. Heading east along the coast will take you to Carrick-a-Rede. Here you can try the famous, nerve tangling rope bridge which takes you over the rocks to the lovely Carrick-a-Rede Island.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area head west along the coast to visit another local highlight at Mussenden Temple. Here you will find the ruins of the historic Downhill House and the wonderfully positioned 18th century cliff top temple. From here there are more outstanding views over the Inishowen Peninsula to enjoy. The Portballintrae to Ballintoy Coastal Walk passes the site on its way along a popular section of the Causeway Coast. To the south west there's the Portrush to Portstewart Cliff Walk as well. The famous Bushmills Whisky Distillery is located a short walk from the site. It's another major local attraction and can be reached on the Bushmills to Giants Causeway Walk which follows the Bushmills railway to the site."
