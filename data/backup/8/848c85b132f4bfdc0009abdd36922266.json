  "description": "Enjoy miles of walking trails through this expansive wood in Oxfordshire. There's 1000 acres to explore on a network of well laid out footpaths. The woods are owned by the University of Oxford and are open to the public by obtaining a free permit for walking but are closed to dogs, horses and bicycles. Wytham Great Woods are one of the most researched areas of woodland in the world. These include projects on climate change, blue and great tits, badgers, bats and small mammals. Inspector Morse fans may recall references to the woods in the books and television series, including the episode 'The Way Through the Woods'. You can start the walk from the car park at the eastern end of the woods, near the Keeper's cottage. Then pick up the paths heading west before exploring the southern part of the site. There's attractive mixed woodland and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Keep your eyes peeled for badgers and various woodland birds. The woods are located just to the east of the Thames Path. You could pick up the riverside trail and head south to Swinsey and the pretty Farmoor Reservoir to extend your walk. Heading the other way along the river will soon take you to the delightful Port Meadow, just over a mile to the east of the site. The Oxford Green Belt Way also skirts the northern edge of the woods. The long distance trail will take you through some lovely countryside around Oxford.",

      "content": "After your walk head east to the noteworthy Perch Inn in Binsey for some well earned refreshments. The thatched 17th-century country inn is one of the oldest pubs in Oxford and sits next to the lovely Port Meadow. It has a great menu and a splendid, large garden to sit out and relax in during the warmer months. Notably, the pub was a frequent haunt of Inspector Morse from the famous ITV series of the 80s and 90s. You can find it on Binsey Lane at postcode OX2 0NG. On the western side of the woods there's Eynsham where there are a couple of worthy options:- The Queens Head serves great food including excellent pizzas from their wood fired pizza oven. You can sit outside in their beautiful beer garden if the sun is shining. The pub is located on Queen Street at postcode OX29 4HH. The Talbot Inn dates from the 18th century and includes exposed beams & a riverside deck. You can find them on Oxford Road at postcode OX29 4BT. Both these inns are dog friendly. The historic market town of Eynsham is also well worth exploring with several 16th and 17th buildings, plus the site of a medieval abbey to see."
