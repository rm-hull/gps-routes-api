  "description": "Enjoy miles of walking trails through this expansive wood in Oxfordshire. There's 1000 acres to explore on a network of well laid out footpaths. The woods are owned by the University of Oxford and are open to the public by obtaining a free permit for walking but are closed to dogs, horses and bicycles. Wytham Great Woods are one of the most researched areas of woodland in the world. These include projects on climate change, blue and great tits, badgers, bats and small mammals. Inspector Morse fans may recall references to the woods in the books and television series, including the episode 'The Way Through the Woods'. You can start the walk from the car park at the eastern end of the woods, near the Keeper's cottage. Then pick up the paths heading west before exploring the southern part of the site. There's attractive mixed woodland and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Keep your eyes peeled for badgers and various woodland birds. The woods are located just to the east of the Thames Path. You could pick up the riverside trail and head south to Swinsey and the pretty Farmoor Reservoir to extend your walk. Heading the other way along the river will soon take you to the delightful Port Meadow, just over a mile to the east of the site. The Oxford Green Belt Way also skirts the northern edge of the woods. The long distance trail will take you through some lovely countryside around Oxford.",
