  "description": "This Berkshire based village makes a good start point for exploring the North Wessex Downs AONB. Inkpen is located just a few miles south of Hungerford. The settlement is noted for its rare crocus field and a noteworthy 13th century church. This circular walk from the village explores Inkpen Common before climbing to the highest point in Berkshire at Walbury Hill. You'll also visit Inkpen Hill and Combe Gibbet, a historical structure with a grisly past. The walk starts near the common at the 17th century Crown and Garter pub. There's parking here and a bakery so you can pick up some supplies before your walk. The route then follows country lanes south to Trapshill before climbing to the series of hills at Gallows Down. There are some excellent views over the county from this elevated spot.",
