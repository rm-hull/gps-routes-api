  "description": "This walk takes you around the historic Sandon Hall estate in the Staffordshire village of Sandon. The hall grounds and gardens are generally not open to the public though there are open days and the opportunity to book a tour. See the link below for more details. This circular walk takes you along the public footpaths which run along the sides of the estate. You'll also enjoy a waterside stroll along the Trent and Mersey Canal which runs along the western side of the park. Along there way there's fine views over the countryside and hills of the Trent Valley. You can also visit the noteworthy church which dates to the 13th century and is Grade I listed. The walk starts in the village at the Dog and Doublet, a delightful Arts and Craft period Inn dating from 1906. From here you pick up trails heading east and then south east along the side of the park. These will lead you to Gayton and Weston where you pick up the canal. Follow the towpath north west and it will take you to Sandon Lock where you leave the canal and return to the village. To continue your walking in the area head south into Stafford where you can explore the historic castle and enjoy a nice riverside walk.",
