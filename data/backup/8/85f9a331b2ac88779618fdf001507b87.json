  "description": "This walk starts in Leek and uses sections of the waymarked Staffordshire Moorlands Walks trail to visit some of the highlights of the area including Tittesworth Reservoir, Rudyard Lake, Ladderedge Country Park, Deep Hayes Country Park, the Churnet Valley, Consall Nature Park, Coombes Valley RSPB Nature Reserve and the Caldon Canal. There's lots of long waterside sections, hill climbs, wildlife rich nature parks and lovely Staffordshire countryside to see on the walk. This route covers a large part of the northern section of the route but you can see more of the trail marked on the Ordnance Survey map below as it makes its way south towards Alton. At the northern end of the route you can take a small detour to climb to two of the highlights of the area at The Roaches and Hen Cloud. There's some wonderful rock formations and far reaching views in this area.",
