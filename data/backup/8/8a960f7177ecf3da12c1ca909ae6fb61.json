  "description": "This West Northamptonshire based village sits in a pleasant rural spot on the Grand Union Canal Walk . This circular walk from the village takes you south along the canal to neighbouring Stoke Bruerne . You can then return through the countryside on a section of the Midshires Way . The route also passes along the Blisworth Tunnel which runs between the two villages. Along the way there's some pleasant views of the surrounding countryside to enjoy.",
