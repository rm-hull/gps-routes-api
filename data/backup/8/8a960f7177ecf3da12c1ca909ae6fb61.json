  "description": "This West Northamptonshire based village sits in a pleasant rural spot on the Grand Union Canal Walk. This circular walk from the village takes you south along the canal to neighbouring Stoke Bruerne. You can then return through the countryside on a section of the Midshires Way. The route also passes along the Blisworth Tunnel which runs between the two villages. Along the way there's some pleasant views of the surrounding countryside to enjoy.",
