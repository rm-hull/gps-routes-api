  "description": "This country park and Iron Age hill fort are located just to the south of Northampton. You can enjoy a series of footpaths taking you up to the ancient fort which stands at a height of 113 metres. There's a nice wide lawn which is ideal for picnics on warm days. To continue your walking in the area head just a mile to the east to visit Delapre Abbey Park. You'll find 500 acres of parkland, lakes, woodland and gardens surrounding a fine mansion which was once the site of a 12th century abbey. Just a 10 minute walk west there's also the Grand Union Canal Walk with easy waterside trails along the towpath.",
