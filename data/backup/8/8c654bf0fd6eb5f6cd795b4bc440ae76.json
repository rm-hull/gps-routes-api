This picture was taken just below the Roman Museum; it wasn't a particularly high tide. This is a good location for spotting cetaceans in the Solway if the sea surface is calm. They may be so far out that it is very hard to see them with the naked eye, so it's worth taking binoculars for cetecean and bird spotting."
