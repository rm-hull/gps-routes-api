  "description": "Explore this large green space on this pleasant walk in Tunbridge Wells. The common is criss-crossed with lots of nice walking trails and a cycle path. On the common you'll find woodland, heathland, ponds and a variety of wildlife. Look out for roe deer, voles, lizards and grass snakes. Around the ponds you can see frogs, toads, newts and dragonflies. The area is also well known for its sandstone outcrops and the Wellington Rocks where there are nice views over the cricket ground below. The common is located next to The Pantiles just to the north of Tunbridge Wells West Rail Station. It's easy to extend your walking in this lovely area. You can pick up the Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk which explores the countryside, nature reserves and woodland surrounding the town. If you head north west you will soon come to Rusthall Common where there are more interesting shaped rocks such as Toad Rock and Loaf Rock. Also nearby is the splendid Broadwater Warren RSPB nature reserve. The reserve has miles of well laid out footpaths and a boardwalk through wet woodland to try. Just to the east of the common is the splendid Dunorlan Park. The large public park has a pretty lake, wide open lawns and wonderful views of the surrounding countryside of the Weald. For cyclists National Cycle Route 18 can be picked up from the western edge of the common. You can follow it west towards Friezland Wood, High Rocks and Groombridge.",

      "content": "The Barn pub in Tunbridge Wells is an establishment of some note. It has an interesting history having been reconstructed from a centuries old Elizabethan Barn which was originally built in a nearby Kent village and re-erected on its present site. Recreated in the original Kentish style with oak beams and columns throughout it has an interior full of character. Outside there is a delightful award winning courtyard garden. Heated for cooler days and beautifully illuminated at night, it's really very pretty and a lovely place to relax with refreshments after your exercise. You can find the pub in the town centre at 1 Lonsdale Gardens, Mount Pleasant Road with a postcode of TN1 1NU for your sat navs."

Just to the north there's the village of Speldhurst where you'll find an ancient pub dating back 1212. If you follow the Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk west you will soon come to the High Rocks National Monument. It's a fantastic spot with a series of huge sandstone rocks and some lovely wooded areas to explore."
