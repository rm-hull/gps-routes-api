  "description": "This challenging walk in the Cairngorms takes you to the unusual Ben Avon plateau with its numerous granite tors and wonderful far reaching views. You start in Braemar in a parking area just off the Old Military Road to the east of the village. You then pick up the Gleann an t-Slugain path which will take you to Ben Avon. It's generally a very good path passing through woodland, along pretty streams and through the delightful Fairy Glen. On the way you'll enjoy great views over Glen Quoich, Glas Allt Mor and Slochd Mor. At the summit you will find the huge Leabaidh an Daimh Tor. Some scrambling is required to get to the true summit where there are excellent views of Beinn a'Bhuird mountain. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to Linn of Dee and Linn of Quoich which are both near Braemar.",
