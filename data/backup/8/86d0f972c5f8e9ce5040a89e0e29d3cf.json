A magnetomometer [geophys] survey has produced astonishing results which demonstrate that the megalithic remains at Stanton Drew are but the ruins of a much more elaborate and important site.... There are nine concentric rings of buried pits and a very large buried enclosure ditch.... The circles are the largest and most numerous yet recorded at any site and surely indicate the investment of immense effort and enterprise in the service of prehistoric beliefs as yet dimly perceived.'"

  "description": "This short walk visits the Stanton Drew Stone Circles in Somerset. The area is run by English Heritage and includes three ancient stone circles. It is notable as the third largest complex of prehistoric standing stones in England. You can start the walk from the car park at the site. Then follow footpaths east to explore the circles. The largest of these is known as the Great Circle, measuring 113 metres (371 ft) in diameter. It is the second largest stone circle in Britain after the Avebury Stones. The scheduled ancient monument is throught to date from the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age period. Part of the route uses the Two Rivers Way which you can use to extend your walking in the area.",
