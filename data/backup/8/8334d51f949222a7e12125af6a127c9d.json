  "description": "This beautiful arboretum\u00a0and\u00a0botanical garden near Moreton-in-Marsh is perfect for a peaceful afternoon stroll. There are 56 acres to explore on a series of good footpaths with woodland consisting of Japanese maples, magnolias and pines.  It's a special collection with many rare trees and plants, particularly from the Far East. There are over 2,850 specimens including Bamboo, Acer and Pinus, all with helpful labels. There is also a lovely wildflower meadow which attracts a variety of insects, butterflies and birds. Other highlights include the Japanese bridge, streams, a number of statues and a lake. Batsford Arboretum is located just over a mile from Moreton-in-Marsh in the Cotswolds. You could walk to Batsford from Moreton-in-Marsh or Blockley by following the Monarch's Way long distance trail. You could also head south along the Heart of England Way to the nearby Sezincote House where you'll find beautiful gardens surrounding an unusual\u00a0Neo-Mughal house.",
