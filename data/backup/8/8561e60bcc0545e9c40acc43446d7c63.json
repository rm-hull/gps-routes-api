  "description": "A delightful coastal walk from Cumbria into Lancashire in the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. It's an interesting and attractive stretch of coastline with rocky outcrops, shingle beaches, peaceful coves and wonderful views across Morecambe Bay. The route includes a mixture of footpaths, woodland and beach walking. There's also great views of the Lake District mountains in the distance. Starting from Arnside the walk follows the coastline around Blackstone Point, Arnside Park and Far Arnside before coming into Silverdale. Silverdale is a nice village with a village school, library, two village halls and two churches. You can enjoy refreshments at one of the pubs or cafes at the end of the walk. You can turn this route into a longer circular walk by returning to Arnside via the fine viewpoint on Arnside Knott. There's more great views over Grange over Sands, Morecambe Bay and the Lake District fells from the elevated position. You could also head east across Silverdale Green and visit the lovely Leighton Moss Nature Reserve where there's an abundance of wildlife including breeding bitterns, starlings, bearded tits, marsh harriers and red deer.",
