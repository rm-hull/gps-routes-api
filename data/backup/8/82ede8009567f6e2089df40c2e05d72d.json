  "description": "Visit these beautiful falls near Lake Vyrnwy on this short walk in Powys. The Rhiwargor Trail takes you along the Afon Eiddew to a series of pretty waterfalls. You can park at the Rhiwargor Waterfall car park at the northern end of the lake. From here you get direct access to the footpaths along the river to the falls. It's a lovely area with the rushing river surrounded by attractive woodland and the steep hills of the Afon Eiddew Valley. There's picnic areas by the water, nice grassy paths and a stream crossing on some stepping stones. You can extend your walk by strolling along the lovely Lake Vyrnwy. The area is also a RSPB nature reserve so you can look out for a variety of birds including great crested grebes, dippers and buzzards. There's bike hire at the southern end of the lake so you could hire a bike and cycle to the falls from Llanwddyn.",
