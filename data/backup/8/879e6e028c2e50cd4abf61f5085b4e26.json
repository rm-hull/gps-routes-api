Kettleness became a smaller hamlet, with houses rebuilt slightly further inland."

  "description": "A circular walk from Runswick Bay to Kettleness on the North Yorkshire coast. The route uses a section of the Cleveland Way to take you along the coast path to Kettleness before returning via the dismantled railway line running between the two settlements. On the way there's some excellent views over the bay with woodland and countryside scenery on the return leg. It's about a 5 mile walk on elevated cliff top paths before a fairly flat railway path section.",
