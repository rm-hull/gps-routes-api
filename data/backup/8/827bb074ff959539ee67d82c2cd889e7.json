  "description": "Follow the River Thame from Albury in Oxfordshire to Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire on this pleasant waterside walk. The route runs for a distance of about 15 miles on fairly flat paths so could be completed in a day by walkers with a good level of fitness. The walk passes Shabbington, Long Crendon , Chearsley, the 12th century Notley Abbey and Nether Winchendon. The Thame Valley is home to an abundance of wildlife including reed warblers, cuckoos, damselflies and butterflies. Plant life and woodland also thrives making for a interesting walk for the naturalist. Highlights on the path include the 15th century Nether Winchendon house, the attractive market town of Thame and the 15th century church of St Mary at Long Crendon.",
