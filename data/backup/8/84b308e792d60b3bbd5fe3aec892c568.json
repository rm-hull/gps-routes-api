  "description": "Visit this beautiful waterfall on this short walk from the Yorkshire town of Settle. The waterfall is about a two mile walk from the town, following the Settle Loop along a series of country lanes and tracks. Although a short distance it is quite a challenging route with the waterfall situated in an elevated position above the town. It's a really beautiful spot with the water cascading down several levels to the deep pool below. The walk starts from Settle near the train station and tourist information centre in the town. You then head south along Mitchell Lane, Lambert Lane and High Hill Lane to Scaleber Bridge.  Here you will find a sign pointing you to Scaleber Foss along a public footpath. Climb over the wall and follow the path and you will soon come to the falls. Along the way there's some splendid Yorkshire Dales scenery to enjoy. If you prefer a shorter walk you can just park by the roadside on High Hill Lane and follow the little footpath to the waterfall. To extend your walking in the area you could also visit the splendid Catrigg Force waterfall or enjoy a waterside walk along the Ribble Way. You could try our Settle Caves and Waterfalls Walk to reach Catrigg Force and also visit some of the mysterious caves in the area.",
