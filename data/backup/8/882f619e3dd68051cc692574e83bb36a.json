The 2 mile 34 chain single track line was opened to Harborne in 1874. Passenger services ended in 1934. Goods services continued into the 1950s, as the line also served the Mitchell & Butler's Brewery and the Chad Valley toy factory. The line was finally closed in 1963."

  "description": "Follow the Harborne Walkway along a disused railway line from Summerfield Park to Harborne on this easy walk or cycle in Birmingham. The path is well surfaced so it's an easy, safe cycle ride to try in the city centre. It's also a nice atmospheric stroll with shady woodland and the pretty Summerfield Park to explore at one end of the route. Right next to the park you will find Edgbaston Reservoir. You can follow the surfaced track around the water to extend your walk. You are also very close to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal so you could pick this up and enjoy a waterside walk or cycle.",
