It looks rather like heather from a distance, but lives in a very different habitat. This plant was growing on a shingle outcrop at the edge of the saltmarsh at Fingringhoe Wick nature reserve, which was then the headquarters of the Essex Naturalists Trust"

  "description": "This walk visits the Fingringhoe Wick Nature Reserve in the Essex village of Fingringhoe. The reserve lies just to the east of the village and includes some pleasant footpaths taking you around the wildlife rich salt marsh. The reserve is notable as Essex Wildlife Trust's first nature reserve. It's a great place for bird watching with many different species of wader enjoying the wetlands, pools and lakes at the site. Birds to look out for include Marsh Harrier, Avocet and Merlin. In the warmer months many species of butterfly can also be seen fluttering around the various wildflowers. On the eastern side of the reserve there's also some pleasant views of the River Colne. In nearby Wivenhoe you can pick up the Wivenhoe Trail and follow it north along the river to Colchester. Heading south along the Wivenhoe to Brightlingsea Walk will take you to the Colne Estuary National Nature Reserve at Brightlingsea. There are more great bird watching opportunities to be found here.",
