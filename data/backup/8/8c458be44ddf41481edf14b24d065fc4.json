  "description": "Enjoy a walk or cycle along this beautiful loch in the vast Galloway Forest Park. The expansive loch is ideal for walking with miles of trails to follow next to the water or into the surrounding woodland. It's a very peaceful area with other local lochs to visit, rushing brooks and fine views of the surrounding hills. You can start your walk from the car parking area at the north eastern tip of the loch, next to the dam. From here you can pick up a trail heading along the Forestry Road to the much smaller Loch Skelloch, crossing the Water of Girvan as you go. The route then passes through a woodland area to bring you out on the edge of the loch where you'll find a nice picnic area.",
