  "description": "This town in Greater Manchester has some nice canalside walks and a fine local country park and nature reserve to explore on foot. In the historic town centre there's also some interesting Edwardian and Victorian terraced housing and several listed mills to see. This route from the town uses part of the Glazebrook Trail and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to create a circular walk around the town. On the way you'll visit the lovely Pennington Flash Country Park where there are good wildlife spotting opportunities. You'll also pass a number of historic mills which made the town a major player in the cotton and silk industries. The walk starts on the canal in the town centre and follows the towpath west towards the country park. Here you can pick up the Glazebrook Trail and follow the waymarked trail east along the course of the River Glaze, passing Lately Common on the way. The route then turns north through Hooten Gardens to return to the canal where it meets the Bedford Brook. You then head west along the canal to return to the start point.",

If you follow the Leeds and Liverpool Canal north west you could head towards Wigan and pick up the Wigan Canal Walk. Here you can visit the Wigan Flashes Nature Reserve where there's an abundance of water loving wildlife to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
