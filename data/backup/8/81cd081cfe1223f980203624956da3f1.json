  "description": "This pretty lake is located just north of Northwich in the Cheshire village of Pickmere. There's some nice walking trails taking you along the water where you can look out for a variety of wildlife. The lake is also very popular with swimmers. You can start off from The Turton Pavilion car park on the eastern side of the water. If you head west from the park you will soon come to Marbury Country Park where you can enjoy more waterside trails around Budworth Mere in Great Budworth . Near here there's also walks along the River Weaver and the Trent and Mersey Canal where you can see the wonderful Anderton Boat Lift .",
