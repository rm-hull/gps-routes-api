  "description": "Follow the sea wall from Dawlish to Dawlish Warren on this lovely coastal walk. The sea wall runs right alongside the train line with the beach on the other side. It's about a 2 mile walk on a very flat section of the South West Coast Path, so ideal for a nice easy afternoon stroll. The walk starts on the front in the seaside resort of Dawlish. The attractive town has a nice beach and a pretty park through which Dawlish Water flows. It's also known for its black swans, introduced from Western Australia, which live with other exotic waterfowl in a small urban sanctuary on Dawlish Water. The town is easily accessible with a train station on the Exeter to Plymouth line. The walk heads north east along the sea wall with views of the red sandstone cliffs which characterise the area. At the end of the walk you will find the Dawlish Warren Nature Reserve which is an excellent place for birdwatching on the Exe Estuary. Here you can look out for little egrets, herons, kingfishers, reed buntings and peregrines. The resort also has a number of nice cafes and restaurants for refreshments at the end of your walk. There's great scope for extending your walk if you have time. You could pick up the Teignmouth and Dawlish Way and head through the countryside to the nearby town. Or you could continue along the sea wall to Teignmouth on the Teignmouth to Dawlish Railway Walk. At Dawlish Warren you can pick up the Exe Valley Way and head north into Exter along the Exeter Canal and the River Exe.",
