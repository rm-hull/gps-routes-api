  "description": "This walk takes you along the coastal path at Dunmore East in County Waterford. You'll pass along the cliff tops as you make your way west to Portally, Rathmoylan and Ballymacaw. The route takes place on a well maintained path runs for a distance of about 7km so 14km there and back. The walk starts at the public car park near Flat Rocks, just south of the harbour. You then head south west past Flat Rocks where you pick up the cliff top path. Follow the trail west and it will take you to the beauty spots at Portally Cove, Rathmoylan Cove and Ballymacaw Cove. From the elevated path there are some splendid rock formations and wonderful views of the Waterford coastline throughout. Also look out for seals, whales and dolphins which can sometimes be spotted in the waters below.",

They serve a good range of meals and snacks which you can enjoy from the outdoor seating area overlooking the harbour. At the end of the route near Ballymacaw there's Dowers Bar And Shop. There's a friendly welcome and a good pint in this bar just north of the cove."

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you could head south to Tramore where you can try the Doneraile Cliff Walk. It's a shorter, easier walk but with more excellent views. In the village you can also enjoy a walk along the lovely sandy beach and dunes. Head north to Waterford and you can pick up the Waterford Greenway, a cycling and walking trail running along a disused railway line to Dungarvan. There's also the easier May Park Trail Waterford River Walk to try in the city. To the north west are the stunning Comeragh Mountains where you can try the popular Coumshingaun Lake Loop Walk or visit the picturesque Mahon Falls. To the east you can see the oldest working lighthouse in the world at Hook Head. It's well worth a visit with guided tours and a maritime exhibition to see. The walk also visits the historic Slade Harbour and castle, which dates back to the 15th century."
