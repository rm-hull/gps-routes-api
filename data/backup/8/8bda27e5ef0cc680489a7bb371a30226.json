  "description": "This walk takes you along the coastal path at Dunmore East in County Waterford. You'll pass along the cliff tops as you make your way west to Portally, Rathmoylan and Ballymacaw. The route takes place on a well maintained path runs for a distance of about 7km so 14km there and back. The walk starts at the public car park near Flat Rocks, just south of the harbour. You then head south west past Flat Rocks where you pick up the cliff top path. Follow the trail west and it will take you to the beauty spots at Portally Cove, Rathmoylan Cove and Ballymacaw Cove. From the elevated path there are some splendid rock formations and wonderful views of the Waterford coastline throughout. Also look out for seals, whales and dolphins which can sometimes be spotted in the waters below.",
