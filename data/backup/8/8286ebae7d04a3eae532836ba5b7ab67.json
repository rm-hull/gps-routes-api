  "description": "This circular walk in Angus takes you along the old Dundee and Newtyle Railway paths surrounding the village of Newtyle. The village is located about 10 miles north west of Dundee and was the northern terminus for the first commercial railway in Scotland, which opened in 1831. The walk starts just east of the village where you can pick up the railway path and follow it north towards Newbigging Wood. The route then loops round, passing Bannatyne House and Hatton Castle before returning to the village. On the way there's nice views of the surrounding countryside and evidence of the old railway cuttings/bridges.",
