  "description": "This walk visits the Crichope Linn waterfall\u00a0near\u00a0Gatelawbridge\u00a0in Dumfries and Galloway. Just to the south of Gatelawbridge\u00a0there's a country lane where you'll find a sign pointing to the falls. Go through the gate and you can follow a footpath east along the Crichope Burn. This will take you through a wooded red sandstone gorge to the pretty falls. On the way look out for some interesting rock formations and 19th century stone carvings along the path. The path can get a bit muddy in the cooler months so it's best to wear some good footwear at these times.",
