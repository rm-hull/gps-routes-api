  "description": "This walk visits the Crichope Linn waterfall near Gatelawbridge in Dumfries and Galloway. Just to the south of Gatelawbridge there's a country lane where you'll find a sign pointing to the falls. Go through the gate and you can follow a footpath east along the Crichope Burn. This will take you through a wooded red sandstone gorge to the pretty falls. On the way look out for some interesting rock formations and 19th century stone carvings along the path. The path can get a bit muddy in the cooler months so it's best to wear some good footwear at these times.",

The long distance Romans and Reivers Route starts in the forest. This 52 mile route follows the old Roman Roads to Hawick in the Scottish Borders. Following the trail north east will take you to Moffat where you can enjoy a riverside walk along the River Annan on the Annadale Way. A few miles to the north east there's the larger Daer Reservoir where there are some nice waterside trails. It is located near the Southern Upland Way long distance trail. To the north west you'll find the 17th century Drumlanrig Castle. The castle is surrounded by extensive grounds with several waymarked walking paths and some challenging mountain bike trails to try."
