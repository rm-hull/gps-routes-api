  "description": "Follow the Goyt Way along the Peak Forest Canal and the River Goyt on this lovely waterside walk through Greater Manchester and Derbyshire. The walk starts by Etherow Country Park Lake in Compstall and heads south through Marple and New Mills to Whaley Bridge . The first section through Marple follows the towpath of the Peak Forest Canal, passing pretty locks on the way. You then join the River Goyt to New Mills before picking up the Canal again near Whaley Bridge where the route finishes. The final section through New Mills passes the wonderful Torrs Riverside Park and Millennium Way , a beautiful river gorge with a fabulous 160 metre long walkway\u00a0elevated over the water.",
