  "description": "This attractive Worcestershire based village is in a great location for countryside walking. The pretty village includes some photogenic thatched properties and a fine village pub. This circular walk from the village visits the splendid viewpoints on Bredon Hill before heading to the delightful neighbouring village of Elmley Castle. Part of the route makes use of the Wychavon Way, a long distance waymarked trail running through the area. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Wychavon Way and follow the trail north west to Bredon Hill and the Banbury Stone Tower viewpoint. The hill is a great place for local walks with an Iron Age Hill Fort and a nature reserve with some splendid flora and fauna. You continue east past Doctor's Wood to Elmley Castle, a picture postcard village with a village pond and an old church dating from the 12th century. The route then heads south to Fiddler's Knap before picking up a bridlepath taking you past Ashtonwood House and Holcomb Nap Hill. Shortly after you return to Ashton Under Hill and then end of the route.",
