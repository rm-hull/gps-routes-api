The location is marked by a cast-iron post, sunk into the peat in 1851 until it rested on the clay beneath. The drainage of the fens since then has resulted in the ground sinking by 4 metres since then leaving the post completely exposed. The post on the left was installed in 1957 when the other became unstable near to Holme, Cambridgeshire."
