  "description": "This attractive town sits on the shores of Loch Broom in the north west of Scotland. It's notable as the place where you can catch the ferry over to Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides. This walk takes you along the harbour and sea wall before climbing to the viewpoint on Ullapool Hill. The walk starts in the car park in the town centre and heads west to visit the Ullapool River. You can then follow trails around the harbour passing the Stornoway Ferry. The trail then heads east to climb to Meall Mor or Ullapool Hill. The hill stands at a heigh of 270 metres, providing great views over the town to Loch Broom and the sea. The route then descends back to the town passing the hill's woodland and waterfalls as you go. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Ullapool. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
