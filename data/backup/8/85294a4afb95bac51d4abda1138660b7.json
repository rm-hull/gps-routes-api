  "description": "The 1,500 acres of parkland surrounding the red brick Victorian mansion of Hughenden Manor is great for a short walk in lovely surroundings. There's woodland trails, pretty formal gardens and riverside paths to enjoy. The area is also surrounded by some beauitful Chilterns countryside. The house and parkland is run by the National Trust so there are four good waymarked paths to try. There also beautiful formal gardens with an Italian influence, a walled garden, a willow maze and orchards. Hughenden Manor was home to Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli during the 19th century. You can explore the house with its wonderful collection of personal memorabilia and Victorian playroom. If you enjoy this walk then you could head to the nearby West Wycombe Park to extend your exercise.",
