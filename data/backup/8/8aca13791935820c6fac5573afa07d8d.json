In the distance upstream is the QEII bridge and you may just be able to make out the guylines fanning out from the two main bridge supports. In the very far distance to the left is the chimney of Littlebrook power station."

  "description": "This Kent based village has some pleasant waterside walking and an historic abbey park to explore. Greenhithe is located on the River Thames Estuary between Dartford and Gravesend. This circular walk in the village takes you to Ingress Abbey before heading to up to the riverside Ingress Park. The walk starts in the Ingress Abbey heritage park, just south of the river. You can follow some pleasant footpaths around the ancient site which includes a photoegnic Neo-gothic Jacobean-style country house and a grotto  known as the cave of the seven heads. The interesting piece is thought to have come from the medieval London Bridge. There's other old stone relics, wide grassy areas and woodland to explore here. The walk then heads north along the boulevard to the river where there are pleasant surfaced footpaths with views towards London. To continue your walking in the area head south to visit Beacon Wood Country Park. There's miles of peaceful woodland trails with countryside views to enjoy here.",
