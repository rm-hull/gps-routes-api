  "description": "Explore this beautiful Victorian Parkland Estate located in the heart of the Midlothian countryside. The park contains several walking and cycling trails taking you through the acres of woodland and parkland which surround the baronial-styled Vogrie House. There are several pretty water features to enjoy with ponds, burns and the River Tyne running through the park. Also make time to visit the pretty walled garden and the Rookery. The peaceful woodland contains a variety of different trees including Oak, Rowan and Red Cedar. It's a haven for wildlife so look out for Jay, Nuthatch and Woodpeckers. Vogrie has several additional attractions with a nine hole golf course, miniature railway and the Cedar Tree Cafe. There is also a Ranger Service which organises guided walks through the grounds. The estate is located about 10 miles south east of Edinburgh, near Dalkeith where you could visit Dalkeith Country Park .",
