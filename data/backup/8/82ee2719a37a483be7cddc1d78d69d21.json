  "description": "A nice walk from Badby to Hellidon, passing Arbury Hill, the joint highest point of Northamptonshire. You can follow a series of quiet country lanes and other tracks between the two villages with nice views of the hill and the surrounding countryside. The walk starts in the centre of Badby and heads west along Bunkers Hill for nearly a mile. You can then pick up a footpath taking you toward the hill which stands at a height of 225 m (738 ft). You continue west along bridleways to Hellidon, passing some lovely countryside and pretty ponds on the way. In Hellidon you can extend the walk by picking up the Jurassic Way long distance footpath. You could follow it south east to Steppington Hill and Charlweton. Heading north will take you to Lower Catesby and Staverton. In Badby you can explore Badby Woods to the south of the village. The attractive woods are famous for the carpets of bluebells in the spring months. Near here there's also the historic Fawsley Hall where you can see a fine 15th century house surrounded by lakes, formal gardens and parkland landscaped by Capability Brown. For another hill climb in the Daventry area head to Borough Hill to the east of the town.",
