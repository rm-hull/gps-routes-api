  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the Beverley Beck and the River Hull on this pleasant waterside walk in Beverley. The route runs for just under 5 miles on a series of very flat, public footpaths. The walk starts at the Beverley Beck, just a short distance east of the Minster and train station. Follow the pleasant footpath east until it meets with the River Hull at the recently restored lock gates and pumping house. You then turn north toward Tickton where you can cross the river and follow the path on the eastern side for a while. The route then crosses back to the western side and follows the beck back into Beverley. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Beverley Twenty long distance circular walk and explore the countryside surrounding the town. Our Tickton and Leven Canal Walk will take you north along the river to the now disused Leven Canal. There's nice footpaths here to follow into the village.",
