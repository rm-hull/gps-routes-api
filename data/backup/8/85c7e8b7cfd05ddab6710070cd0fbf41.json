  "description": "This Oxfordshire based village includes a pleasant local nature reserve and a noteworthy Iron Age hill fort on the Ridgeway National Trail. This circular walk from the village takes you through the Letcombe Valley Nature Reserve to Letcombe Bassett before heading south to pick up the The Ridgeway and visit Segsbury or Letcombe Castle Hill Fort. The walk starts in the village and starts by heading south past Letcombe Manor and the Letcombe Brook. Follow the brook south west and it will take you to Letcombe Bassett, passing through a secluded nature reserve on the way. There are some handy information plaques telling you all about the flora and fauna you can see around the brook. At the end of the reserve you head south to link up with the Ridgeway around Smith's Hill Farm. Follow the waymarked footpath east and you will soon come to the hill fort where there are some splendid views over the area. From the fort you can then head north along the Warborough country lane which will take you back into the village.",
