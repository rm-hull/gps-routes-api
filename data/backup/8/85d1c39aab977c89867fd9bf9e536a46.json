  "description": "These pretty woods in the Forest of Dean have miles of peaceful woodland trails to follow. You can park at the medium sized Queens Wood car park to start your walk. It's located just to the south of Kempley. From here you can pick up several different trails, heading west into Queen's Wood in the Dymock Forest. Heading east takes you into Dymcock Wood. The woods consist of Norway Spruce, Douglas Fir, Oak and Beech. In the spring months you will see lots of wildflowers including bluebells, heather, wood anemone and the Wild Daffodils which are a feature of the area. You should see lots of butterflies fluttering around the flowers too. Look out for pearl-bordered fritillary, wood white and the uncommon white admiral as you make your way around the site. This walk takes you along a pretty stream to a large pond in Queen's Wood. Leave the car park and head west before turning south along the stream. You then return on other paths through Brandhill Wood. The long distance Daffodil Way passes through the eastern section of the woods. You can pick it up to extend your walking through the Forest of Dean. It will take you on a tour of the countryside, orchards and woodland surrounding the village of Dymock.",
