  "description": "Follow the Caldon Canal through the beautiful River Churnet Valley on this easy walk in Staffordshire. The walk starts at the lovely Froghall Wharf where you will find a good sized car park. You then pick up the canal towpath and head to Cheddleton before finishing at Deep Hayes Country Park . Along the way you will pass some attractive woodland which is worth exploring with a small detour. For example the Consall Nature Park is located just to the west of the canal near Consall Forge. It has miles of nice walking trails and is easy to access from the route. Also of interest is the Churnet Valley Steam Railway which runs alongside the canal. One option would be to catch the train back from Cheddleton to Kingsley & Froghall Station. The canal runs along some of the prettiest countryside in Staffordshire with views of the River Churnet, pretty locks and arched stone bridges to enjoy. You'll also pass villages and hamlets such as the delightful Consall Forge where you can stop for refreshments at the canalside Black Lion Inn. There's great outdoor seating with views of the canal and the passing steam trains. The route follows the Staffordshire Way long distance trail so there is scope for continuing your walk towards Leek and Ladderedge Country Park . Deep Hayes Country Park at the end of the walk is also well worth exploring.",
