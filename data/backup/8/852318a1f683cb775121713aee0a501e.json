  "description": "Explore the 200 acres of parkland surrounding the 14th century Dean Castle in Kilmarnock. There are peaceful woodland trails and a waterside path along Kilmarnock Water to enjoy. The park also contains a wonderful urban farm with llamas, fallow deer, kune pigs, highland cattle, a Clydesdale horse and donkeys. The castle itself is also well worth a visit with collections of historic weapons, armour and musical instruments. The original keep was built around 1350 with the Palace being added around 1460. Dean Castle also has excellent facilities including a visitor centre, tearoom and a shop.",
