  "description": "This walk visits the delightful Allington Lock on the River Medway in Kent. The lock is a pleasant place for a stroll with a footpath running right across it. Just below the lock, the Medway becomes tidal. This circular walk starts at the lock and takes you along both sides of the river on the Medway Valley Walk . On the way you will enjoy some fine views of the surrounding countryside and skirt the edge of the neighbouring town of Aylesford. The area next to the lock additionally includes the Malta Inn for refreshments and the fascintating Kent Life Museum. The fascinating open air museum includes two small hop gardens growing Fuggles and Goldings hops, Apple and plum orchards, a herb garden, a soft fruit garden and various livestock. Also of interest is the historic Allington Castle. The Grade I listed castle dates from the 13th century and is now used as a wedding venue.",
