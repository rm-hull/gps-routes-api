  "description": "This Somerset based village is surrounded by some attractive rolling countryside and woodland. There's also numerous fine walking options in the nearby Mendip Hills. This circular walk from the village visits Greyfield Woods, High Littleton and Bungay's Hill. The walk starts in the village and follows Mill Lane south towards Radford. Here you can pick up the Limestone Link and follow the trail west along the Cam Brook towards Hallatrow, passing Paulton on the way. The walk then turns north to visit Greyfield Woods. These woods have some nice peaceful trails with ancient woodland, spring bluebells and a pretty waterfall to see. From the woods you head east through High Littleton before following a country lane along Bungay's Hill to return you to Timsbury. There's some nice views over the surrounding countryside from this final elevated section of the walk.",
