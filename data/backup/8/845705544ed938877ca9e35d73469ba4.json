      "content": "A walk around the old part of this fascinating town is highly recommended. Here you'll find fine medieval, Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian architecture, including more than 100 listed buildings. There's also the ruins of the castle and the pretty South Pond to visit. The castle hosted both Queen Elizabeth I and King Henry VIII. Guy Fawkes also once worked at the house, which later caused the Montague Family to be implicated in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. It also played a part in the Civil War, when the Parliamentarians used the house as a Roundhead barracks. For some easy walking near the town head to Iping Common and Stedham Common. There's miles of attractive heathland walking trails here with lots of wildlife to look out for too. For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks and South Downs Walks pages."
