To the east there's the pretty waterfall at Crichope Linn and the small but delightful Loch Ettrick on the edge of the Ae Forest. The long distance Romans and Reivers Route also starts in the forest. This 52 mile route follows the old Roman Roads to Hawick in the Scottish Borders. Following the trail north east will take you to Moffat where you can enjoy a riverside walk along the River Annan on the Annadale Way. Near here there's also the 17th century Drumlanrig Castle. The castle is surrounded by extensive grounds with several waymarked walking paths and some challenging mountain bike trails to try."
