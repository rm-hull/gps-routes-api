  "description": "This walk visits the Levant Mine and the Geevor Mine in Pendeen, Cornwall. The two historic mines are located just to the west of Pendeen. You can start off from the car park at the Levant Mine. The old mine is located in a stunning spot near to the coast. Owned by the National Trust it is the only Cornish beam engine that is still in steam on its original mine site. The Levant engine sits in a small engine house on the edge of the cliffs. You can pick up footpaths around the site before heading inland to the Geevor Mine. To continue your walking in the area head south along the coast path to visit the nearby Botallack Mine and explore the Kenidjack Valley .",
