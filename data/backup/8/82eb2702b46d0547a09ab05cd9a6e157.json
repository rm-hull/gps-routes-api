  "description": "This country park consists of 500 acres of woodland, parkland and gardens surrounding a Grade I listed 15th century manor house. The house has an interesting history being previously owned by Elizabeth Sydenham who married Sir Francis Drake. It is alleged that Sir Francis Drake fired a cannonball into the grounds of the manor to warn Elizabeth not to marry another man. The expansive estate is a great place for walking with miles of waymarked trails to follow. There's lots to see with a deer park, herb garden, rose garden and peacock house. You can also stroll along a series of pretty pools with a lovely cascading stream, waterfalls and lots of wildlife to look out for. There is also a hill to climb with a viewpoint proffering great views over the of the Quantock hills and across the Seven Estuary to Wales. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head further into the Brendon Hills and climb to the high point of Lype Hill for more great views. The Coleridge Way also passes the park so you could pick up this long distance walk and head towards the Brendon Hills or the Quantocks. The little village of Monksilver is a good place to go for a bite to eat after your walk.",
