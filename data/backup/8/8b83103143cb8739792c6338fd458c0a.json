  "description": "This circular walk visits a wildlife rich nature reserve and country park in Birchwood, Warrington. The reserve includes some pleasant nature trails taking you around the large areas of peat bog. There's bird hides, a watchtower and a number of sculptures to see on the walk. Other habitats includes peaceful woodland paths, wildflowers with butterflies and ponds where you can see toads and newts. There's also good facilities with a car park and visitor centre with a wealth of information on the site. The reserve lies right next to Birchwood Forest Park where there are some more good walking trails and a cycle path. To continue your walking in the area you could head to the Rixton Clay Pits reserve which lies just to the south. Near here you can also pick up the Mersey Way and enjoy a riverside walk. Following the trail towards Warrington will take you to the Paddington Meadows reserve where there's wildflower meadows, an orchard and rare breed longhorn grazing cattle.",
