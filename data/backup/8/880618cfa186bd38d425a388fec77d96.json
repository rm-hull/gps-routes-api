  "description": "This major north east town has a number of good options for walkers with two significant waymarked trails running through the area. There's also several nearby woods, country parks and riverside trails along the Derwent and Tyne Rivers. This walk takes you along the Tyne before visiting Watergate Forest Park and Derwent Walk Country Park . It uses two of the waymarked trails which run through the town in the shape of the Tyne and Wear Trail and the Derwent Valley Walk . The walk starts next to the impressive Tyne Bridge which links Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead. From here you can pick up the Tyne and Wear Trail and follow it west past a series of bridges, to Dunston. Here you leave the river and head south to Watergate Forest Park. The popular park is located on the site of the former Watergate colliery. It includes woodland trails, a roman fort, a pretty lake and wildflower meadows. After exploring the park the route heads west through Whickam to visit Derwent Walk Country Park. Here you'll find another lake, a mixture of woodland, meadows and wetland areas. You could also cross to the western side of the river and visit Thornley Woods where there's a sculpture trail and a visitor centre with lots of information about the area. At the park you can pick up the Derwent Valley Walk and follow it north along the river to Damhead Wood. You could take a small detour here and head into Blaydon where you can visit the Shibdon Pond Nature Reserve. This route heads east through Swalwell to rejoin with the Tyne and Wear trail near Dunston. You can then rejoin with the river and follow the path back to the start point.",
