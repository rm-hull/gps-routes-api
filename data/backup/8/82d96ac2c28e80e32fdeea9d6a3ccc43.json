  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the lovely Fontburn Reservoir in Northumberland. The walk starts at the car park on the eastern edge of the reservoir and  follows a waterside path along the southern shoreline. At the western end of the reservoir the path heads through woodland before climbing towards Priest's Knowe where there are lovely views of the reservoir. You then descend to Ritton White House before another short woodland section takes you back to the car park. All the while there are wonderful views of the surrounding countryside, particularly the Simonside Hills and Harwood Forest. The route runs for about 4 miles with some small climbs, so suitable for most abilities. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the St Oswald's Way and explore the beautiful Simonside Hills.",
