  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around these pretty woods near Scunthorpe. The walking trails take you around the pretty Gull Ponds and past shrubs, conifers and lovely colourful rhododendrons. It's good for wildlife spotting too. Look out for woodpeckers, tree creepers and common warblers. There's a car parking area just north of Greetwell which gives direct access to the footpaths. The woods are located just west of Scawby. The area has an interesting history. Twigmoor Hall, was the home of Jack Wright, one of Guy Fawkes' co-conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot. Legend has it that the plot was hatched at Twigmoor Hall. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Messingham Sand Quarry where there are nice footpaths running around a series of lagoons. Also nearby is Laughton Woods with more peaceful woodland trails to try.",

The pub is based about a mile east of the woods in the centre of the beautiful village of Scawby, and has a large car park to the rear. They are renowned for their home-made food and do most of the \u2018pub classics\u2019 - all from scratch. They specialise in real ales, and recently won the CAMRA pub of the season award. There's also a nice garden area where to relax in during the summer months. You can find the pub on 10 West Street with a postcode of DN209AN for your sat navs."

It starts in the town and uses part of the Trent Valley Way and the Chesterfield Canal to explore the area. A few miles to the east you can visit the interesting market town of Brigg and enjoy a waterside walk along the New River Ancholme to the Humber Bridge on the Humber Estuary near Hull and Barton Upon Humber. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lincolnshire Walks page."
