  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around these pretty woods near Scunthorpe.  The walking trails take you around the pretty Gull Ponds and past shrubs, conifers and lovely colourful rhododendrons.\u00a0 It's good for wildlife spotting too. Look out for woodpeckers, tree creepers and common warblers. There's a car parking area just north of Greetwell which gives direct access to the footpaths. The woods are located just west of Scawby. The area has an interesting history. Twigmoor Hall, was the home of Jack Wright, one of Guy Fawkes' co-conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot. Legend has it that the plot was hatched at Twigmoor Hall. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Messingham Sand Quarry where there are nice footpaths running around a series of lagoons. Also nearby is Laughton Woods with more peaceful woodland trails to try.",
