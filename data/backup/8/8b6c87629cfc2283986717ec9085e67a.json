Access to the east bank is restricted as this is a SSSI."

  "description": "This walk visits the Upper and Lower Bittell Reservoirs in Barnt Green, near Birmingham. There's much to enjoy with countryside views and lots of birdlife to look out for on the water. The walk starts from Barnt Green train station and follows footpaths through the countryside to Lower Bittell Reservoir. Tracks take you along the western side of the water to the Upper reservoir, with views of the River Arrow as you go. You can then pick up a section of the North Worcestershire Path along the northern end. On the eastern side of the reservoirs you can pick up the Worcester and Birmingham Canal to extend your walk. Following it south will take you through Alvenchurch to Tardebigge Locks. You could also follow the North Worcestershire Path west and visit the splendid Lickey Hills Country Park for great views over the area. The Barnt Green Circular Walk visits both the park and the reservoirs, with lovely views of the surrounding Worcestershire countryside.",

      "content": "The Alvechurch Walk visits the reservoirs from the nearby village. It takes you along the canal to the reservoirs before climbing up to Lickey Hills. It's a nice way of visiting the lakes by public transport as there is a train station in Alvechurch. The historic settlement is a nice place for a stroll too with a 13th century church, several medieval half-timbered buildings and a rather fine canalside pub. Head south into Redditch and you could enjoy lakeside paths and a walk along the River Arrow in the pretty Arrow Valley Country Park. For more walking ideas in the area see the Worcestershire Walks page."
