The Romans established a fort at Cramond, guarding the River Almond's estuary. Artifacts such as pottery and coins suggest activity in the region from around 142 AD to later Roman periods. In more recent history, the island played a role in both World Wars, with military fortifications still visible. These include anti-ship blockades and gun emplacements designed to protect against potential naval attacks."

  "description": "This walk begins at the foreshore near Cramond village in Edinburgh and follows the tidal causeway to Cramond Island. You can start the walk from the public car park next to Cramond Tower. Then head north east at low tide for just over 1km to reach the island. The route offers panoramic views across the Firth of Forth, with the rugged island ahead and glimpses of Fife\u2019s coastline in the distance. Wildlife includes seabirds such as oystercatchers and curlews, as well as seals often visible in the water. N.B: Check tide times before setting out, as the causeway is submerged at high tide. Allow sufficient time for a safe return. You can continue your walking in the area on the Cramond to South Queensferry Walk which will take you along the coast path on the waymarked John Muir Way .",
