  "description": "This Shropshire based village is an interesting an worthy place for a walk. It is notable as the home of the Snailbeach lead mine which used to be one of the biggest and richest lead mines in the country. The site is an important part of Shropshire\u2019s industrial heritage and is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It's thought to be the most complete collection of mine building remains in England. The area makes for a fine walk with the atmospheric ruined mines, woodland trails, pools and a small reservoir to explore. This circular walk from the village explores the ruined mines before heading up to one of Shropshire's highlights at the Stiperstones Nature Reserve. The walk starts from the public car park on the western side of the village. Head east and you can then explore the old mines and the reservoir. The route then follows footpaths south past Blakemoorgate to climb up to the Stiperstones. Here you'll find a series of interesting rock formations and fabulous views over the Shropshire Hills. On the hill you can pick up the Shropshire Way and follow it south along the ridge before turning north east. Trails will then take you to Pennerley and Tankerville before passing Mytton Dingle, Oak Hill and Crowsnest to return to Snailbeach.",

Inside there's an olde worlde feel with exposed beams, small cosy rooms, and open fires. Outside there's a garden is the weather is fine. You can find them at postcode SY5 0LZ."
