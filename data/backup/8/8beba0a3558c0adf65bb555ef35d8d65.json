  "description": "This circular walk visits the lovely Shardeloes Park and Lake near Amersham in Buckinghamshire. It's a peaceful and scenic place with waterside trails along the lakes and the River Misbourne which runs through the area. It's also great for wildlife with lots of water loving birds to look out for in the park. Start the walk just to the west of Amersham Old Town, next to the lake. You can then follow a section of the South Bucks Way west along the lake to Mop End Lane. Follow the lane south and it will take you towards Mop End Woods where there are some nice peaceful trails and bluebells in the spring months. You continue north east past the woods to return to the lake where the walk finishes.",
