The line north of Aylesbury had been closed since 3/9/66, but kept in use for trains of household waste to Claydon via Calvert and for access to the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre at Quainton Road."

Some years ago this bend was smoothed out however, creating a little cut-off section of road rather like an oxbow lake is created on a river. This has resulted in these cottages being in a far quieter and more secluded location than they were originally."

  "description": "This shared cycling and walking trail links Aylesbury Vale Parkway Station with the village of Waddesdon and Waddesdon Manor. The trail was opened in 2018 and runs for about 4km along a flat, surfaced path, which is suitable for all abilities. There's information boards and lovely views of the surrounding Buckinghamshire countryside to enjoy on the way. You can extend your walk at the extensive grounds surrounding the fine French Renaissance-style chateau. Walking trails take you through woodland, Victorian style gardens, a parterre with ornate fountains and a working aviary with adjacent rose garden. The Aylesbury Ring long distance trail also runs through the area. It's a great way of exploring the countryside surrounding the town.",

      "content": "To the north of the manor there's also the pretty village of Quainton to explore. The settlement is well worth a visit with an old windmill, a picturesque village green, a 14th century church, a row of 17th century almshouses and a rather fine 1700s pub to visit. To the north of the village there's also an excellent viewpoint at Quainton Hill. For more walking ideas in the area see the Buckinghamshire Walks page."
