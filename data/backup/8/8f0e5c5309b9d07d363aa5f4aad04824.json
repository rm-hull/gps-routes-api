  "description": "Llyn Crafnant is another beautiful reservoir in the Gwydyr Forest area of the Snowdonia National Park. There's a splendid 3 mile circular trail running around the lake with great views to the surrounding forests and Carneddau mountains. It's a fairly easy waymarked walk so perfect for an afternoon stroll in peaceful surroundings. You can start the walk from the car park on Crafnant Road, just to the north of the reservoir. Head south from here and you can pick up the footpaths on the western side of the water. Follow the path through the woodland and past the lake until you come to the River Hendre. You turn left here and cross the river to return to the Crafnant Road. You can follow this quiet little country lane all the way back to the car park. On this section you'll pass the lakeside cafe where you can hire boats and stop for a bite to eat. There is also the option of picking up more woodland trails to the east of the lane if you prefer. You can extend your walk by following more waymarked trails over Mynydd Deulyn to Llyn Geirionydd , about half a mile to the east. There's another nice circular trail to try here. Just over a mile to the west you can visit Llyn Cowlyd where there is another nice trail running along the lake. The challenging climb to Moel Siabod also starts from nearby Capel Curig .",
