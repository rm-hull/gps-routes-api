  "description": "Explore this beautiful section of the Dane Valley and enjoy rivers, old stone bridges and waterfalls on this lovely walk in the Peak District. Three Shires Head is a point on Axe Edge Moor where the counties of Cheshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire meet. Here you will find a Grade II-listed packhorse bridge over the River Dane. The bridge is thought to have been constructed in the 18th century. It's a delightful area with a number of small waterfalls and the surrounding Peak District scenery to enjoy. The walk begins from a parking area in Gradbach a couple of miles south of Three Shires Head. You then follow the Dane Valley Way and other footpaths to the bridge and the river. Here you will also find Panniers Pool, a popular place for a paddle or swim in the summer months. An alternative route would be to come from Buxton and follow the Dane Valley Way across Axe Edge Moor to the bridge. This is a much longer walk but does pass through the pretty Buxton Country Park on the way. To extend your walking in the area you could visit the fascinating Lud's Church . The deep chasm is located just to the west of the start point of this walk. Just to the south you can climb to The Roaches . This elevated rocky ridge, includes fascinating rock formations and wonderful views of the surrounding countrsyide. It is one of the most popular walks in the Peak District.",
