The branch from Burlescombe to Tiverton was opened in 1820 and brought limestone to the town from Canonsleigh quarries. Later Tiverton was linked to Taunton but the section from Holcombe Rogus to Taunton was abandoned in 1865. A series of old limekilns built into the superstructure survive underneath the elevated canal terminus. No less than twenty were in use here and in nearby Limekiln Road in the 1830s"

  "description": "An easy walk along the Grand Western Canal from Tiverton to the nearby village of Sampford Peverell. It's about a 6 mile walk along a lovely stretch of the canal, so perfect for a Sunday afternoon stroll. The walk starts from the Tiverton Canal Basin, just to the east of the town centre. You pick up the towpath and head east into the countryside, passing Tiverton Golf Club before coming to Halberton. The route continues past Battens Bridge to Sampford Peverill, where there is a lovely view of St John's church and the rectory from the canal. You can extend the walk by continuing along the towpath to Greenham. To continue your waterside walking in the Tiverton area you can pick up the Exe Valley Way which runs through the town. You could follow the riverside path south to Bickleigh. To the north of the town is Knightshayes Park where there's a beautiful country estate surrounding a Gothic Revival Mansion.",
