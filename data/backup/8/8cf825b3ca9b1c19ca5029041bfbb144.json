  "description": "A short and easy walk around this pretty lake in the North York Moors. You can follow a walking trail from the Kilburn White Horse car park to the lake. It's about a 2 mile walk north from the white horse with a woodland section through Hood Grange Wood. After passing along the lake you head past Gormire Rigg before returning on a mixture bridleways and footpaths. The walk can be extended to visit Sutton Bank and the Kilburn White Horse. Sutton Bank is a high point in the Hambleton Hills and commands splendid views over the North York Moors, the Vale of York and the Vale of Mowbray. The Cleveland Way runs past Sutton Bank so you could pick up the trail and head north to further explore the Hambleton Hills .",
