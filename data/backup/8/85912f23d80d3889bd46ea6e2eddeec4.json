  "description": "This popular, easy walk follows the River Crane through Crane Park in Twickenham.  There are good footpaths running along the riverside with woodland, scrub and reedbed. The park includes the Crane Park Island Nature reserve where you can look out for herons, water vole, woodpeckers, kingfisher, dragonflies and damselflies.  You'll also pass the old Shot Tower, evidence of the The Hounslow Gunpowder Works which used to operate on the site of the park in the 18th century. It's a nice walk for families or anyone looking for an easy afternoon stroll. Access is straightforward with the walk starting from Twickenham station. The park is located on the London Loop so it's easy to extend your walk towards Hounslow Heath or Teddington. You're also very close to Marble Hill Park and Strawberry Hill House. These can both be reached with a short stroll along the River Thames.",
