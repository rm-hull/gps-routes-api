  "description": "This circular walk around Ashover explores the countryside around the village. On the way you'll climb to the Ashover Rock/Fabrick viewpoint, enjoy views of the River Amber, visit the village of Milltown and enjoy woodland sections around Cocking Tor. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths east up to Ashover Rock at Farhill. It's a lovely spot with pretty heather on the hills and great views over Peak District hills. On a clear day, views can be seen of nearby\u00a0Chesterfield with its\u00a0Crooked Spire,\u00a0Bolsover Castle,\u00a0Hardwick Hall, some suburbs of the\u00a0South Yorkshire\u00a0city of\u00a0Sheffield, and the surrounding counties of\u00a0Nottinghamshire,\u00a0Leicestershire,\u00a0Staffordshire. After climbing Farhill you descend back toward the village and head south toward Milltown with nice views of the River Amber on the way. At Milltown you turn west and head to Cocking Tor where there are some woodland trails to try. You then head north past Overton Hall to return to the village. To continue your walking in the area head south east to visit Ogston Reservoir . The reservoir is one of Derbyshire's premier bird watching sites. The county town of Matlock is also nearby where you can pick up several good walking trails including the long distance Derwent Valley Heritage Way .",
