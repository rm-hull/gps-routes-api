  "description": "Enjoy a lovely walk through the River Otter Valley on this waterside route near Budleigh Salterton. The walk starts from the village of Otterton and takes you along the River Otter to the Otter Estuary at Budleigh Salterton. The estuary is very pretty consisting of a variety of habitats including salt marsh, reed beds, low-lying meadows and pastureland. The Otter Estuary Nature reserve is a great place for bird watching. Look out for birds including cormorant, redshank, common sandpiper and curlew. You can enjoy a stroll along Budleigh Salterton beach before returning to Otterton along the river. At the coast you can pick up the South West Coast Path to extend your walk. Heading west will bring you to Exmouth, while Sidmouth and the beautiful Ladram Bay can be found in the other direction. At the secluded bay you will find a pair of striking\u00a0sandstone sea stacks in a lovely spot with a small beach. Also nearby is the lovely Woodbury Common . Here you will find miles of walking trails through heathland and heather with an ancient hill fort to visit too.",
