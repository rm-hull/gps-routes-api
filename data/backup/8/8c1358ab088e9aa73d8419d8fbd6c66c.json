  "description": "This is a challenging horseshoe shaped walk which takes you on a tour of some of the Lake District's most beautiful fells. The walk begins at Ambleside and heads towards Rydal Mount, the historic home of William Wordsworth. You climb to Heron Pike and then onto Great Rigg and Fairfield before returning to Ambleside via Dove Crag, High Pike and Low Pike. The views are spectacular with Rydal Water, Grasmere, Lake Windermere and Coniston Water all visible from the peaks. This is an extremley challenging walk with an ascent of nearly three thousand feet. The paths are well defined however, care should be taken on the summit of Fairfield where in poor visibility there is the danger of steep drops to the north and west.",
