  "description": "This circular walk from Birdlip explores the countryside and woodland to the west of the village. On the way you'll enjoy woodland trails in Witcombe Wood, visit the pretty Witcombe Reservoirs and pass the historic Great Witcombe Roman Villa. There's also a climb to the Barrow Wake viewpoint where you can enjoy nice views over the area. The walk starts on the western side of the village where you can pick up the Cotswold Way National Trail. Follow the waymarked trail south west and it will take you through Witcombe Wood towards Coopers Hill, Cranham Woods and Buckholt Woods. Near here you turn north east to follow trails past Great Witcombe Roman Villa. The English Heritage run site  was built about AD 250, and lived in until the 5th century. The remains include a bathhouse complex and mosaic pavements. After exploring the villa you continue north to the reservoirs where a footpath heads east between the lakes before coming to Great Witcombe and Little Witcombe. You continue east, passing Birdlip Hill before coming to the viewpoint at Barrow Wake. There's splendid views over the Cotswolds Hill from here. There's also a car park here so you could make this a start point for the walk. After taking in the views the route then descends to the south to return to the village.",
