  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around one of the most stunning lakes in the Lake District National Park. Wast Water is the deepest of all the lakes and is surrounded by some of the highest mountains - Red Pike, Kirk Fell, Great Gable and Scafell Pike (England's highest mountain). In 2007 the public voted Wast Water Britain\u2019s favourite view in an ITV television program. Although the complete route below is suitable for walkers, a quiet country road runs along the western edge of the lake so you can enjoy an excellent waterside cycle ride too. The walk starts at the car park at Wasdale Head at the north eastern end of the lake. You can find it at postcode CA20 1ET. From here it is a short stroll down to the lake where you can pick up the circular footpath which runs for about 7 miles around the lake. It's fairly flat with a few small climbs on the way. Wast Water is located about 6 miles north east of Ravenglass .",
