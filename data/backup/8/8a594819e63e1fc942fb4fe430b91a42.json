  "description": "This circular walk visits Wilton Windmill in the North Wessex Downs area of Wiltshire. It then heads through the woodland of the Wilton Brail to meet up with the Kennet and Avon Canal where you can enjoy an easy stroll along the towpath. You'll also pass the pretty Wilton Water where you can watch the birds on the lake. The walk starts in the centre of Wilton village though you could also start at the lay by car parking area at the windmill where there are a few spaces. It's a short stroll east from the village to the windmill along a country lane. You can then stroll around the mill which is surrounded by some lovely countryside. The mill is notable as the only working windmill in Wessex and still produces wholemeal, stone-ground flour. During the summer season there are also guided tours available on certain days. After exploring the site you retrace your steps for about a quarter of a mile before picking up footpaths heading north east to Dodsdown and the woodland and Wilton Brail. The paths will take you up to the canal around Mill Bridge where you can pick up the towpath and follow it west to Crofton where you'll find the interesting old pumping station which dates from 1812. You can then leave the canal and follow footpaths south east to Wilton Water.  In addition to providing water for the canal, which is pumped by the nearby Crofton Pumping Station, it provides a haven for wildlife. Shortly after passing the pretty lake you will return to Wilton where the walk finishes.",
