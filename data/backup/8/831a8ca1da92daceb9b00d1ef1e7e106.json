In 1961, exactly 100 years after the line opened, closure of the line to passenger traffic took place. Freight traffic lingered for another four years before the line closed entirely with the track being lifted in 1966. From a mapping point of view the Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale shows three parallel dashed lines along here, the centre black one representing this non-accessible route of the old railway with two red lines representing footpaths running alongside it on the far sides of the hedges seen here."

  "description": "This Essex based town has some nice trails through the Colne Valley and some attractive local woods to visit. This circular walk visits the River Colne before heading to the nearby Broak's Wood to the west of the town. The walk starts in the town where you can pick up the Colne Valley Path and follow it north along the River Colne. It's a pleasant stroll through the town along the river where you'll pass the photogenic old Courtauld Mill. Wool and weaving provided the mainstay of Halstead business over the centuries. The picturesque Townsford Mill now holds a large antiques centre. After about a mile you leave the river turn west to explore the woodland trails in Broaks Wood. This varied wood is run by the forestry comission and has a unique variety of tree species including a splendid Giant Redwood Grove. The ancient woods are a peaceful place for a walk near the town with 5 miles of trails to try. The route then heads to Whiteash Green before following footpaths south east past Great Spansey Wood to the town. On the way you'll pass the Victorian style public gardens which is a nice place for an easy stroll in the town centre.",
