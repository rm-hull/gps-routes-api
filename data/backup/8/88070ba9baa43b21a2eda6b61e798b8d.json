  "description": "This town is located near to the city of Swansea and the splendid Gower Peninsula. This walk from the village follows a section of St Illtyd's Walk up to the Graig Fawr summit. From here there are splendid views over the surrounding countryside to the coast. The route starts at the train station where you can pick up St Illtyd's Walk and follow the waymarked trail east through the town. It then turns north to climb up to Graig Fawr, passing near to Cefn Drum on the way up.",

      "content": "Head south to the coast and you could visit the splendid Pembrey Country Park and the Millennium Coastal Park in Llanelli. There's some great cycling and walking trails here with wonderful sea views to enjoy. You can also pick up the Swiss Valley Cycle Route here. The multi user trail runs along a disused railway path from the coast to Tumble village. The Heart of Wales Line Trail passes through the town. The 143 mile trail explores the Heart of Wales Railway Line, a wonderful rural railway running between Swansea and Shrewsbury. The trail visit several train stations, old railway lines and photogenic railway viaducts. Following the path north would take you to Ammanford where you can enjoy some pleasant trail along the River Amman. Heading south would take you to Gorseinon and then to the finish point of the route at the Millennium Coastal Park in Llanelli. For more walking ideas in the area see the Gower Walks page."
