  "description": "This walk follows a lovely section of the South West Coast Path from Polperro to Lansallos. It's about a 7 mile walk there and back, using an undulating footpath. Starting on the front in Polperro you head west, passing Chapel Cliff and Nealand Point. You then pass along Lansallos Cliff before turning inland to follow a footpath into Lansallos. It's a beautiful area which includes lovely beaches, wild flowers and lots of birds to look out for. The National Trust is active here and has a car park which offers an alternative start point to the route. In the village there is a noteworthy church which dates back to the 15th century. You can continue your exercise on the circular Lansallos and Lantivet Bay Walk which visits a wonderful scenic cove and a picturesque beach waterfall.",
