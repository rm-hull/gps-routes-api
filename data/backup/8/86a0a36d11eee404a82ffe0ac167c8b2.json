  "description": "This rural Kent village is located in an attractive area of the North Downs, just north of Sevenoaks. This circular walk from the village visits the Kemsing Down Nature Reserve before following a section of the North Downs Way to the north of the settlement. The walk starts in the village car park and heads north west to visit Kemsing Down. The reserve is run by Kent Wildlife Trust and includes ancient woodland trails, grassland and interesting flora including pyramidal orchid and bluebells. From the high points there are some tremendous views over the area. The route continues to Rowdow Wood where you can pick up the North Downs Way and follow it east to Otford Manor, Cotman's Ash and Summeryards Wood. Here you turn south to pick up the Pilgrim's Way country lane which can be followed west back to the village.",
