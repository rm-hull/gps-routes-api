  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Ilam Park into the beautiful Dovedale in the White Peak. It's about a 7 mile walk with a moderate climb on the way so a reasonable level of fitness is required. The route starts from the parking area in Ilam Park and heads east to pick up Ilam Moor Lane. You can follow this country lane up to Stanshope, passing Bunster Hill and Damgate on the way. At Stanshope you can pick up footpaths heading south east to take you into Dovedale where you'll come out near the picturesque spot of Dove Holes with its two caves. Follow the footpaths south along the river and through the woodland and they will take you to Lovers Leap and the famous Stepping Stones. The stones are one of the most photogenic sights in the area and fine place to rest for a while. They have an interesting history having been originally set down in the 19th century for Victorian tourists to cross the river. The rock at Lovers Leap is also popular place to climb for a view and a photo. It also has a legend attached to it concerning a young woman who believed her lover had been killed in the\u00a0Napoleonic Wars and\u00a0threw herself from the rock. She was saved when her skirt caught in the branches of a tree below. When she returned home, she heard her lover was still alive. You can use the steps on the rock climb the formation for splendid views of the dale. At the southern end of the dale you will reach St Mary's Bridge where you can follow a country lane west back to the car park at Ilam.",
