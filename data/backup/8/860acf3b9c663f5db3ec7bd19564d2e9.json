Recreational use is important, and this traditionally forest based sport is a big user of forests. This is the changeover in the 2005 Scottish Relay Championships. The runners are meeting on one of the tracks that form a grid throughout the forest. Orienteers favour mature open woodland free of ground clutter. The northern part of Tentsmuir is ideal, although things get thicker with younger plantings further south."

  "description": "This route visits the expansive Tentsmuir Forest on the Fife Coast. The forest is a popular place for walking and cycling with miles of trails around the pine woodland and sand dunes. You can start off from the car park located at the south eastern end of the site. From here you can pick up various trails including the Ice House trail which runs to  the 19th century ice house. There's also the Morton Lochs Trail on the western side of the forest which will take you around 3 pretty lochs. The forest is a haven for wildlife with red squirrels and roe deer to look out for on the route. On the north eastern corner there's the Tentsmuir Coastal Nature Reserve where you can see a variety of wading birds. On the Ordnance Survey map below you can see the cycle route marked in the orange dots.",
