There are usually large numbers of ponies on Wilverley Plain - the area was ploughed and used for agriculture during the Second World War and was then reseeded with grass to \"improve the grazing\" for the Commoners' stock. The two adults are \"shading\" out the heat of the day, which strangely does not involve standing in the shade. They just stay very still (for some reason with one leg lifted), flicking their tails at the flies. In the distance are the pines of the Markway Inclosure."

  "description": "This circular walk visits Wilverley Plain and the Wilverley Inclosure in the New Forest. The walk starts from the large Wilverley Plain car park, a couple of miles from Sway. There's also a smaller parking area at Wilverley Inclosure. The plain is an expansive grassy area which is great for picnics or playing games. You'll also see ponies grazing there most of the time. The walk then heads west to explore the adjacent Wilverley Inclosure which is great for a peaceful stroll. Here you will find miles of good footpaths taking you through the conifer and broadleaved woodland. Look out for deer and other wildlife in this pretty area.",
