  "description": "Enjoy a walk along this peaceful reservoir in the Brecon Beacons. The lake is surrounded by some lovely lush countryside and woodland. It's purpose is to supply water to the towns in the valley of the River Tawe and north Swansea, but it also makes for a nice easy walk. You can park at the car park just off the A4067 Swansea Sennybridge road, on the eastern side of the water. Then pick up the footpaths heading north up to the dam with great views across the water and pretty waterfalls to see on the way. You can extend the walk by continuing north along the riverside paths of the River Crai which feeds the reservoir. Just to the west of the site you'll find two other lovely lakes in the shape of Llyn y Fan Fach and Llyn Y Fan Fawr. It's a very popular, isolated spot and a great place to continue your walking in the area. The Usk Reservoir is a few miles to the north on the other side of the Glasfynydd Forest.",

      "content": "Head a few miles south and you'll come to another highlight of the area at Craig-y-Nos Country Park. The park is a lovely place for walk with woodlands, meadows, wide lawns and trails along the River Tawe. There's good facilities with parking, a cafe and good footpaths at the site. To the south you could climb to Fan Gyhirych for splendid views back down to the reservoir. Here you could pick up the epic Cambrian Way. You could follow this west to visit the ridge walk along Fan Hir. This starts from near to the noteworthy Dan yr Ogof and the National Showcaves of Wales where you can explore a wonderful 11 mile long cave system.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Brecon Beacons Walks page."
