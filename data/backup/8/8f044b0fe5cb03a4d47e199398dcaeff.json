Just past the bend in the Luggie, was the Lion Foundry, famous as one of the UK suppliers to the GPO of the K6 Telephone Box. The Luggie Water eventually flows under the nearby Forth & Clyde canal before joining with the Glazert Water north of the town to form the River Kelvin, which then flows to join the River Clyde at Glasgow."

      "caption": "Townhead Bridge, Kirkintilloch. This bridge over the Forth & Clyde canal used to be a lifting bridge, but after the canal was cut by the building of the A80 dual carriageway at Castlecary, councils took great delight in infilling sections of the canal, and Townhead was no exception. The canal was culverted at this point and the gap infilled. When news of the reopening became a reality some 35 years later, the culvert was removed and a new bridge built to span the canal once more. To save money, no provision was made for the towpath to remain with the canal alignment, and walkers and cyclists must now use the ramp to reach road level to cross it. The only saving grace is that the council did provide a set of pedestrian crossing lights here."

Work on the re-opening project started in April 2000 and was completed in January 2001. The mechanical and electrical operating equipment and the control system were reinstated and the control building was rebuilt in its original style. The bridge pivots ('swings') out of the way to let boats pass."
