  "description": "This lovely walk takes you around Worthington Lakes in Standish, Lancashire. You will pass along the footpaths around the three reservoirs that make up this country park and nature reserve. The walk can be started from the car park located towards the southern end of the lakes. On the way look out for a variety of water loving birds on the water and woodland flowers in the warmer months. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs just to the east of the park. You could pick up the towpath and head north to Adlington and Chorley to extend your walk. The park is located near Adlington and Chorley .",
