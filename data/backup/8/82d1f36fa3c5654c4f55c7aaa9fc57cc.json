The chalk grasslands along the trail are home to wildflowers like common rock-rose, cowslips, and orchids, which thrive in the calcareous soils of the area. In woodland sections, oak, ash, and beech trees dominate, while mosses and ferns thrive in shaded and damp areas. Marshy areas near the River Yar host wetland plants, such as reeds and sedges, creating an ideal environment for wetland species."

The Isle of Wight is also home to the rare Glanville fritillary butterfly, often seen fluttering near the trail in warmer months\u200b. Mammals include red squirrels, which benefit from the absence of grey squirrels on the island, and bats that roost in wooded areas"

The windmill is a remarkable historical structure and the last surviving windmill on the island. Built around 1700, it remained operational throughout the Victorian era until its closure in 1913. Managed by the National Trust, it has been carefully preserved, retaining most of its original milling machinery. Visitors can explore its four floors to learn about the grain-to-flour process and enjoy panoramic views from the top. A short film on the ground floor provides additional insights into its history and operation. The windmill has also inspired artists, including J.M.W. Turner, who painted it during his travels. Its picturesque surroundings are ideal for picnics and walking, with the Culver Trail offering scenic routes nearby. Educational activities and family-friendly events are held throughout the year, making it a popular destination for both learning and leisure\u200b"

      "content": "On the north western outskirts of Newport you'll find the expansive Parkhurst Forest. The forest is criss crossed with miles of good walking and cycling trails and a fine place to extend your outing. It's also great for wildlife spotting with the resident red squirrels of particular note. In August you can try the popular St Helens Fort Walk in the neighbouring village which lies just to the north. The walk takes you out to the 19th century St Helens Fort along the causeway at low tide. Just west of Ryde there's another historic highlight at Quarr Abbey. The Grade I listed abbey monastery dates back to the 12th century and includes a scenic estate with lovely gardens, wildflower meadows and woodland with red squirrels to look out for. Very near the abbey there's also some peaceful woodland trails at Firestone Copse and the splendid Isle of Wight Heritage Steam Railway centre at Havenstreet. For more walking ideas in the area see the Isle of Wight Walks page."
