  "description": "This walk visits the mid-14th-century Tantallon Castle from North Berwick in East Lothian. It's about a 3 mile walk along the coast from the town centre, using the fairly flat coastal path before a final section along the road to take you to the castle. The walk starts on the front in North Berwick and heads east along the beach and the lovely Milsey Bay. You continue past the Glen Golf Club to Canty Bay. There are two beaches separated by a rocky headland here. The western beach is uninhabited and accessible by two paths that descend the grass covered cliffs from the eastern end of the Glen golf course. The eastern beach is by the hamlet of Canty Bay. The route then heads along the inland road before turning into the coastal castle. Tantallon is the last medieval curtain wall castle to be constructed in Scotland. It comprises a single wall blocking off the headland, with the other three sides naturally protected by sea cliffs. The castle has an interesting history, playing a part in Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Scotland in 1651. There are also lovely views across the Firth of Forth to the Bass Rock.  This steep-sided volcanic rock, is 107 metres (351 ft) at its highest point, and is home to a large colony of gannets. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the John Muir Way long distance trail. Our Dunbar to North Berwick route follows the path to nearby East Linton and Dunbar. You could also visit the lovely John Muir Country Park or try the circular Dunbar Cliff Walk .",
