  "description": "This area of common land in Bromyard has some nice walking trails and a fine pub to visit. You can start the walk from the car park on the Downs at postcode HR7 4QP. It's located just to the north east of the town. From here you can pick up a series of trails taking you to gorse, grassland, woodland and coppice. It's great for flora and fauna with lovely wildflowers attracting various butterflies during the summer months. Birdlife includes cuckoo, bullfinch, marsh tit, lesser spotted and green woodpecker, woodcock, and stock dove. The Downs are also in an elevated postion, over 700 feet above sea level. As such there are fine views towards the Clee Hills from the high points. The area has an interesting history, having once been a race-course, a golf-course and even a rifle-range. Just to the east is the old railway line which ran from Worcester through to Leominster via Bromyard. In 2022 plans were announced to convert it into a shared cycling and walking route. You can walk along part of the line on the Bromyard Railway Walk which starts to the east of the town at Washcroft.",
