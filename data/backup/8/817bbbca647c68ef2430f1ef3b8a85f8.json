  "description": "This walk takes you along a lovely section of the South West Coast Path from Sidmouth to Budleigh. It's about an mile walk on undulating paths with some moderate climbs near the start. The walk starts on the sea front in Sidmouth and follow the waymarked trail south west along the beach to the popular Ladram Bay. This opening section also climbs to High Peak, an elevated area about a mile south west of the town. It's over 500 feet above sea level so there are fine views over the surrounding countryside and coast. At Ladram Bay you will find a series of photogenic sandstone sea stacks in a lovely bay with a small beach. The trail continues south past Chiselbury Bay before coming to the River Otter and the Otter Estuary just outside Budleigh. It's a scenic spot with lots of wildlife to look out for in the estuary. Shortly after crossing the river you will arrive in Budleigh Salterton where the route finishes.",
