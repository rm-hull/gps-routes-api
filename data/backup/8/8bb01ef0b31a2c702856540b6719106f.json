  "description": "This walk takes you along the Bubwith Rail Trail from the village of Bubwith in East Riding of Yorkshire. It's a nice flat, easy route running along pleasant grassy footpaths for a distance of just under 9 miles. You can pick up the trail just to the south of the village of Bubwith which lies just east of the River Derwent. Follow the trail north east and it will take you past Foggathorpe and Holme-on-Spalding-Moor before finishing just west of Market Weighton. On the way you will pass the site of the old stations on the now disused Market Weighton to Selby line which close in the 1950s. The route is coincident with the Howden 20, a 20 mile circular walk exploring the area. At the western end you could follow the trail south along the River Derwent to visit nearby Breighton.",

The trail also links with the Yorkshire Wolds Cycle Route. The 143 mile circular ride takes you on a tour of some of the Wold's highlights."
