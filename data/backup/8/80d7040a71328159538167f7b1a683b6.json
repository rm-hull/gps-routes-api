The well maintained route runs for about 1km with tremendous views over Tramore beach and sand dunes on one side and The Metal Man, a freestanding painted cast iron statue of a Royal Navy petty officer. Along the way there are benches where you can sit down and relax. To continue your walking in the area head east to pick up the Tramore Sand Dunes walk along the lovely beach. You could also head east along the coast and try the hugely popular Dunmore East Cliff Walk. To the north you can also pick up the Waterford Greenway, a cycling and walking trail along a disused railway line.",

To the east you can see the oldest working lighthouse in the world at Hook Head. It's well worth a visit with guided tours and a maritime exhibition to see. The walk also visits the historic Slade Harbour and castle, which dates back to the 15th century."
