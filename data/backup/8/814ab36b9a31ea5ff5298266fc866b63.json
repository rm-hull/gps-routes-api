  "description": "This circular walk visits Castell Y Bere, near Abergynolwyn in the Snowdonia National Park. The ancient fortress dates back to the early 13th century when it was constructed by Llywelyn the Great. Today you can enjoy a stroll around the substantial ruins with fine views over the surrounding mountains of Snowdonia. It's a popular place for walkers and historians due to its wonderful remote location. There is a roadside parking area where you can pick up the trails around the castle. To continue your walking in the area head south east to visit the worthy village of Abergynolwyn. The historic settlement is located on the heritage Talyllyn Railway and includes pleasant trails along the Nant Gwernol waterfalls to the old Bryn Eglwys Quarry. To the north east there's the lovely waterside trails along Tal-y-llyn Lake and the popular climb to Cadair Idris .",
