  "description": "Enjoy a series of beautiful waterfalls and delightful woodland trails on this walk in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The walk begins at the Taf Fechan Forest car park near the northern end of Pentwyn Reservoir. You then head to Lower and Upper Neuadd Reservoirs on peaceful woodland trails. You'll pass along the Taf Fechan River which is dotted with a number of picturesque waterfalls. The trail then passes along the lovely Lower and Upper Neuadd Reservoirs with the imposing Pen Y Fan making a wonderful backdrop. The route returns to the car park on alternative woodland trails. The whole of this route is designed for walkers but the eastern leg takes place on a super track which is suitable for walkers and cyclists. The route can be extended by following the Taff Trail to the nearby Blaen y Glyn Waterfalls. The Pen y Fan Horseshoe Walk also starts from the car park in the forest and visits the Upper and Lower Neuadd Reservoirs, Corn Du and the Cribyn.",
