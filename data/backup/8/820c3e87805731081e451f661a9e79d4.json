  "description": "This is a popular walk that runs through Cheshire and Shropshire from Frodsham to Whitchurch. The path starts in Frodsham and heads south to Frodsham Hill with lovely views over the Cheshire Plain and the Mersey Estuary. You continue to Delamere Forest with its 2,400 acres of mixed deciduous and evergreen woodland and Blakemere Moss, a lake around 1 km in length. From Delamere you continue south towards Beeston Castle in Tarporley. With an exhibition detailing 4000 years of the castle's history and 40 acres of woodland trails, Beeston is a major attraction on the walk. Soon after you will come to Peckforton Castle, which is actually a country house built in the style of a medieval castle. It is now used as a luxury hotel. The path then heads through the lovely Peckforton Hills, passing the Bickerton Hills and Hampton Green before joining the towpath of the Shropshire Union Canal to Grindley Brook and then onto the finish point at Whitchurch. To extend your walking on the trail you could try our circular walk from Frodsham which uses the Delamere Way to create a loop around the town.",
