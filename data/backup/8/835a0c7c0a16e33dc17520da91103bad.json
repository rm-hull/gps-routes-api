  "description": "This little village in the Cotswolds has some nice footpaths to follow around its fine old country house. There's also views of the River Evenlode and some pretty neighbouring villages to see in the area as well. This circular walk from the village visits the Daylesford House Estate and the neighbouring villages of Adlestrop and Oddington. The walk starts in the village next to the old church and follows a section of the North Cotswold Diamond Way east across the Daylesford estate. You'll pass the woodland in the dell, the lake, the quarries and the farm on the public footpaths which run along the southern side of the estate. The lakeside gardens with wooded walks and rare trees and shrubs are occasionally open to the public in the summer months. Here you can get a closer view of the Grade I Listed Georgian House. After passing the farm the route turns north west to Adlestrop where there's Adlestrop House and a pretty lake to see. You then head south west to Lower Oddington before returning to Daylesford.",
