  "description": "This lovely coastal park consists of woodland trails and nice coastal views. The area is a country park and nature reserve with waymarked nature trails and lots of wildlife to look out for. Highlights are the resident red squirrels, badgers and various wildfowl around the two large ponds. You can also enjoy a stroll to Penrhos beach. Here you can enjoy splendid views across the bay and study some interesting rock formations. Cyclists can visit the reserve by following National Cycle Route 8 from Holyhead. It's a lovely ride passing Penrhos beach before arriving at the park. This route starts at the car park at Penrhos beach and follows a cycling and walking trail through the park to Beddmanarch Bay. The Anglesey Coast Path runs through the park so you can pick this up to extend your walk. If you follow it along the coast you will come to Breakwater Country Park where you can climb Holyhead Mountain for wonderful views over Anglesey, the Isle of Man, the Skerries and the mountains of Ireland.",
