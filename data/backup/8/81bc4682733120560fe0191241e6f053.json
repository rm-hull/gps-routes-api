  "description": "This walk takes you around Backwell Lake in the North Somerset village of Backwell. There's a car park at the eastern side of the lake just north of the village, off Station Road. From here you can pick up a nice circular footpath heading around the lake for about half a mile. The site is also a nature reserve where you can look out for a variety of water loving birds on the water. Keep your eyes peeled for gadwall, shoveler, pochard, tufted duck, grey heron and mute swans as you make your way around the site. To extend the walk you can head north into neighbouring Nailsea where you could visit the splendid Ty Sculpture Trail. If you head south east of the village you could climb up to the Jubilee Stone where there are nice views over the area.",
