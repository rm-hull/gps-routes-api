  "description": "This Lake District based village is located close to the coast at Seascale and Wast Water, England's deepest lake. Wasdale Head is a popular start point to the climb to England's highest mountain of Scafell Pike. It's an interesting and historic place with a 17th century pub, a 12th century church and an ancient Viking cross to see. This circular walk from the village takes you into nearby Blengdale where you can enjoy waterside paths along the River Bleng and explore the peaceful woodland of Blengdale Forest. The route then takes you around Ponsonby Fell where there are some fine views from the 315 metre high summit. You can start the walk from the public car park in the village and then follow country roads north east to pick up the riverside paths into Blengdale.",
