  "description": "This lovely riverside walk in Dartmoor takes you from Grenofen Bridge to Double Waters where the River Walkham joins the River Tavy. You'll pass through the pretty Walkham Valley with attractive woodland and the rushing rapids and quiet pools of the river. The walk starts from the car park at Grenofen Bridge and follows the River Walkham through woodland to the point where the two rivers meet. It's a lovely spot with the rushing water surrounded by peaceful woodland. The walk returns to the car park along the West Devon Way and woodland trails through Sticklepath Wood. You can reach Grenofen bridge by walking or cycling from nearby Tavistock. If you are on foot then you can follow the West Devon Way from the town. If you are coming by bike then you can follow National Cycle Route 27 to reach the river.",
