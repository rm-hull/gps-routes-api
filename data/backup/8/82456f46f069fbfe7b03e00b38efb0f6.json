  "description": "This walk from the train station takes you through the Goyt Valley to three reservoirs to the south of the town. There's nice waterside trails along the reservoirs and the River Goyt to enjoy. The walk starts from the train station and heads south west along the Midshires Way to Toddbrook Reservoir . You continue south throught the Goyt Valley to Errwood Reservoir and Fernilee Reservoir . There's nice waterside trails here with the option of extending the walk around the adjacent Errwood Estate. This includes an old ruined hall and peaceful woodland with azaleas and rhododendrons. The Shining Tor and Cats Tor Walk also starts from the Errwood. These hills offer wonderful views of the Cheshire Plain,  Winter Hill, the city of Manchester and Jodrell Bank . This walk turns north to follow paths along the other side of Fernilee Reservoir before picking up riverside trails along the River Goyt. The route then returns to the town on the Midshires Way. The town is located close to two popular climbs which are a great way to extend your walking in the area. The climb to Eccles Pike is located just a short distance to the east of the town. Chinley Churn and Cracken Edge are also nearby and offer more great Peak District views from their elevated position. You could also head to the canal basin and pick up the Peak Forest Canal towpath for some easy waterside walking.",
