  "description": "Visit these bluebell woods in Dunnington and enjoy a series of peaceful woodland walking trails through the attractive coniferous woodland. There's lots of interesting flora and fauna with primroses, yellow pimpernel, wood anemone\u00a0and dog violets. Look out for foxes, deer, badgers and various woodland birds too. To extend your walking in the area you could head east through the countryside and pick up the Minster Way . It runs along the River Derwent into Stamford Bridge . The woods are located a few miles east of York. You can reach the woods by bike using National Cycle Route 66 .",
