  "description": "This walk in the Scottish Borders follows a section of the Berwickshire Coastal Path to St Abbs Head and lighthouse. It's a rugged stretch of coast with some interesting rock formations and fine sea views. You can pick up the coastal path in the village and then follow it north to Starney Bay, Bell Hill and Horecastle Bay to the headland. Here you'll find the remains of St Abb's Kirk and a fine viewpoint. The area is great for wildlife with thousands of sea birds to see. Keep your eyes peeled for Guillemots, Kittiwakes, Puffins, Razorbills and even dolphins as you make your way along the cliff path. Slightly inland there's also the Mire Loch with swans, ducks, damselflies and butterflies. The site also includes a visitor centre, coffee shop, art gallery and textile shop. There's some fine exhibitions in the Nature Centre where you can learn all about the wildlife, geology and history of the headland. Just west of St Abbs Head you'll find the historic Fast Castle. The photogenic ruins of the 14th century structure are located in a fine spot on a rocky headland overlooking the sea. You can follow the Berwickshire Coastal Path to the site at Dowlaw.",
