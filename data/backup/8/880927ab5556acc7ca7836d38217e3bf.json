  "description": "Also known as the Bissoe Trail, this is a fabulous, largely traffic free ride or walk, from Portreath to Devoran. The Mineral Tramways Coast to Coast trail takes you on a tour of some of Cornwall's historic mine buildings. The trail runs for about 14 miles along a path which steadily climbs to Wheal Busy before descending to Devoran. The path starts on the coast at Portreath and heads through Wheal Rose, Todpool and Bissoe to Devoran. As well as the series of restored mines you will pass the beautiful Bissoe Valley Nature Reserve. The reserve was a former mine site and has heathland, woodland, ponds and variety of widlife. If you enjoy this route then you could try the Great Flat Lode Trail which is another of  Cornwall's Mineral Tramway Trails. The circular route visits South Wheal Frances Mine, South Crofty mine and the historic hilltop site at Carn Brea .",
