  "description": "This pretty country park in Sutton Coldfield has good cycling and walking trails to try. National Cycle Network route 534 runs through the park and there are other surfaced paths for walkers. There are waterside paths along the Plants Brook, wildflower meadows and woodland trails. It's great for wildlife with lots of different bird species and butterflies. Look out for Kingfishers, Grey Heron, Dippers and Reed Bunting around the brook. You may also see birds of prey such as Buzzards, Kestrel and Sparrow Hawks. Other interesting features include the 18th century water mill and the 16th century Vesey Cottage. If you would like to continue your exercise then you could head a mile south to Pype Hayes park. National Cycle Network route 534 runs from New Hall Valley to Pype Hayes along the brook. At Pype Hayes Park you will find more cycling and walking trails.  Also nearby is Sutton Park with 200 acres of open heathland, woodlands, wetlands, marshes and lakes.",
