Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner which was written in the area is commemorated by a statue on the harbourside. The Coleridge Way walking trail can be picked up to the south near Williton. The long distance trail explores the area associated with the famous poet."

  "description": "This coastal Somerset town is in a great spot for exploring the nearby Exmoor and Quantock Hills AONB. The town has an interesting maritime history with many old buildings including two museums and an ancient 16th century inn. There's also two beaches including Helwell Bay where you can go fossil hunting. This circular walk starts at the harbour and then heads west along a section of the West Somerset Coast Path. You will pass the Iron Age fort Daw's Castle and Cridland's Copse before coming to Home Farm. Here you can pick up the Monk's Path to Home Farm Blue Anchor and follow it south east to Old Cleeve and the neighbouring village of Washford. The walk then picks up the route of the Old Somerset Mineral Railway, following it north along the Washford River to Watchet. To extend the walk you could continue west along the coast path Dunster beach where you can also visit the historic Dunster Castle .",
