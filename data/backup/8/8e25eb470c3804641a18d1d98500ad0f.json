  "description": "This beautiful 730 acre lake and country park in Dartmoor is perfect for a waterside cycle or walk. The route starts at the car park by the lakeside cafe and then takes you around the lake on quiet country lanes. There are also two way-marked cycle trails starting near the cafe/visitor centre. The green trail is an easy ride through the woodland and as ideal for families. The blue trail is more adventurous and will suit anyone looking for a fun off road trail. For walkers there are 5 way-marked trails taking you to the cob shelter, bird hide and Jubilee Sundial. Look out for a wide variety of wildlife in the woodland and on the lake.",
