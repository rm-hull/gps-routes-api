  "description": "A circular walk around the seaside town of Weymouth, visiting the promenade, the ruins of Sandsfoot Castle and the pretty Radipole Lake Nature Reserve. The walk starts on the front, near to the train station. From here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it past the piers to Nothe Point and Nothe Fort. The historic fort is well worth a visit with an interesting museum and the adjacent Nothe Gardens to explore. The path continues south to the noteworthy Sandsfoot Castle. The artillery fort was constructed by Henry VIII in 1542. Sandsfoot saw service during the English Civil War, when it was held by Parliament and Royalists in turn during the conflict. It survived the interregnum but, following Charles II's restoration to the throne, the fortress was withdrawn from military use in 1665. You can view the ruins of the castle today which is located next to the picturesque Sandsfoot Cove. At the castle cove you can pick up the Rodwell Trail, a shared cycling and walking path running along a disused railway. It will take you inland to the Radipole Lake RSPB reserve where there are some nice waterside footpaths to try. The Wild Weymouth Discovery Centre is also located at Radipole Lake and features nature and bird exhibits and programs, trails and viewing blinds. To continue your walking in the area you could head to the famous Chesil Beach or continue along the coast path on the Weymouth to Durdle Door Walk and the Weymouth to Swanage Coastal Walk .",
