  "description": "This walk visits the ruins of the 13th century Bothwell Castle next to the River Clyde in Uddingston, near Glasgow. The castle has an interesting history, playing a key part in the Wars of Independence with England. It regularly passed back and forth between English and Scottish hands during this period. Of particular note is the 13th-century donjon, a circular keep tower considered one of the most significant in Scotland. The walk starts at the train station in Uddingston and then picks up a section of the Clyde Walkway. You can follow this waymarked trail south to visit the ruins of the photogenic castle. It's about a 1 mile walk along the river to the castle. The route then continues south to visit the David Livingstone Memorial. Here there's a visitor centre and the globe fountain to see. To extend the walk continue south along the Clyde Walkway and you could visit Strathclyde Country Park and Chatelherault Country Park. In the former there's a fine waterside trail around Strathclyde loch. In the latter there's great cycling and walking trails around the expansive riverside woodland. For more detail on the history and architecture of the castle see the informative wikipedia page page.",
