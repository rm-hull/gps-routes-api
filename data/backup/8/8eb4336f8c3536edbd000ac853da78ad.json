  "description": "This fascinating castle sits in a wonderful location near the shores of Loch Fyne in Argyll. The Gothic Revival castle dates from the 18th century and is surrounded by lovely parkland, woodland and gardens. This walk takes you across the River Aray and the woodland estate to Dun Na Cuaiche where there's a climb to a folly and a viewpoint. From the old stone tower there's wonderful views down to Inveraray and the loch.",

      "content": "Head east to Arrochar and you could enjoy a climb to the popular Cobbler Mountain. At the southern end of the loch you can pick up the Crinan Canal. Head west and there's the popular coastal town of Oban to visit. There's a lovely bay and a fine climb to the viewpoint on McCaig's Tower to enjoy here. To the north of the town there's the expansive Loch Creran where you can visit the wildlife rich Shian Woodland Nature Reserve. To the north there's another lochside castle to see on the Loch Awe and Kilchurn Castle Walk. The popular route visits the ruins of a photogenic 15th century castle which sits in a wonderful position next to the loch. Just west of the castle is the Cruachan Dam and Falls of Cruachan Waterfall Walk. In this area you can visit the Falls of Cruachan, the impressive hydroelectric dam and explore the Cruachan Power Station. To the south west is the fascinating Kilmartin Glen. The ancient site is one of the historic highlights of the area with over 800 prehistoric monuments and an interesting museum to visit. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
