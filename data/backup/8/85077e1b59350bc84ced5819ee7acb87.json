  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this lovely forest in the Dartmoor National Park. The circular route starts in the pretty hamlet of Bellever and passes Laughter Hole Farm, Laughter Tor, Bellever Tor and a number of interesting stone cairn circles. It's a delightful and peaceful area with lots of different walking trails to choose from. Cyclists are welcome but please keep to the stone roads. The East Dart River also runs through the forest so you can enjoy a waterside stroll and a picnic. Look out for Dartmoor Ponies as they graze the forest. The River Teign Walk starts from the northern edge of the forest at the car park at Postbridge. You could extend your walk by following the trail north to Fernworthy Reservoir and Fernworthy Forest. The Lych Way ancient path also starts from the car park at Bellever. You could pick this trail up and follow it west across Dartmoor Forest to Longaford Tor and then on to Lydford. Our Two Bridges Dartmoor Walk also visits the site. The long circular walk starts from the popular Two Bridges car park, visiting the forest and heading to the fabulous Wistman's Wood nature reserve. The Postbridge Circular Walk will take you from the visitor centre to Hartland Tor and the pretty waterfalls along the East Dart River.",

      "content": "Not far from the forest is the noteworthy Warren House Inn, one of the highest pubs in England. The 19th century inn is one of the most famous on Dartmoor, sitting in an isolated position some 1425ft (434m) above sea level. Originally built to serve the busy local tin mining community, the Inn was always a favourite haunt with miners from the neighbouring Tin Mines, including Golden Dagger, Vitifer and Birch Tor Mines. From the elevated position of the inn there are breathtaking views over the area. Indoors there's a cosy interior with oak beams and open fires. They do great food and are also dog friendly. The Warren House Inn lies at the very centre of Dartmoor between Moretonhampstead and Princetown on the B3212 with a postcode of PL20 6TA. From Postbridge just follow the B3212 north east from the village and you will soon come to the inn."
