  "description": "This circular walk follows the Oak Park Forest Loop near the town of Carlow in County Carlow, in the south-east of Ireland. The trail takes you along boardwalks surrounding a shallow man-made lake with a number of islands. It's set within a mature mixed species woodland on the grounds of an historic estate. The diverse habitat created by the combination of water and woodland supports a variety of wildlife, including wild and game birds, swans, and ducks. The serene environment and natural beauty make it a popular spot for walking and birdwatching. The trail offers an immersive experience in nature while also highlighting the historical context of the estate grounds.",
