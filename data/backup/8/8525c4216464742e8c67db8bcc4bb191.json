  "description": "A nice easy coastal walk from Redcar to Saltburn via Marske-by-the-Sea. The route runs for about 4 miles along a beautiful stretch of beach. Start the walk at Redcar Sands close to the train stations. Head south east past Redcar Rocks to the viillage of Marske-by-the-Sea. The village is a nice place to stop for refreshments at one of the cafes at what is roughly the half way point of the walk. It also includes the impressive, Grade I listed Marske Hall which was built in 1625. Continue from Marske and you soon come to Saltburn where you can enjoy a stroll along the pier and catch the funicular railway up to the town. The railway was opened in 1884 and is the oldest operating water-balance cliff lift in the United Kingdom. In the town you can also visit the lovely Saltburn Valley Gardens . The park overlooks the beach and includes beautiful formal gardens, woodland and fine views of the ocean. You can continue along the coast on the Saltburn to Whitby Walk which uses a section of the Cleveland Way long distance trail to visit the historic Whitby Abbey. The epic Teesdale Way also starts in Redcar and will take you along the River Tees to Dufton in Cumbria.",
