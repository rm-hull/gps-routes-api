  "description": "This walk takes you along the Kelly Cut in the Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park near Greenock and Wemyss Bay. The cut is a narrow 4-mile-long non-navigable canal that once conveyed water from The Kelly Reservoir on the hill behind Wemyss Bay and Crawhin Reservoir on Crawhin Hill near Cornalees to The Compensation Reservoir at Cornalees. From there, the water flowed into The Greenock Cut, which supplied water to Greenock for industrial and domestic purposes. Constructed in 1845, the Kelly Cut is less substantial in terms of its construction and footbridges compared to the Greenock Cut. It winds around Wenchly Top, Brown Hill, and Crawhin Hill at approximately 500 feet above sea level. On the walk you will pass a series of pretty reservoirs while enjoying fine views across the heather covered moorland in the park. You can start the walk from the car park at the Greenock Cut visitor centre. You can continue your walking in the area on the circular Greenock Cut Walk which starts from the same car park.",
