In common with the rest of the island, the village's main industry is\u00a0tourism\u00a0and the public sector is also an important employer.

The village has several buildings of historical interest, including Hamilton Terrace, which consists of two rows of single storey-and-attic cottages on the Lamlash seafront, arranged in pairs."

To the right of the photo is a Second World War look-out post - Lamlash Bay was a major Naval Harbour at that time.

Holy island has a long history as a sacred site, with a spring or\u00a0holy well\u00a0held to have healing properties, the\u00a0hermit\u00a0cave of 6th century monk\u00a0St Molaise, and evidence of a 13th-century\u00a0monastery.

  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of the Arran Coastal Way from Lamlash To Brodick on the Isle of Arran. The walk runs for just under 6 miles along a fine coastal trail with tremendous views over the Firth of Clyde and Holy Island. There's also lovely beaches and two delightful villages to explore. You can extend the walk by continuing north to visit the historic Brodick Castle and Country Park. The Lamlash to Whiting Bay Walk will take you south through woodland passing the lovely Glenashdale Falls on the way.",
