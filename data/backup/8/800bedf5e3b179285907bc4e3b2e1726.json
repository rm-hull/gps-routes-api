It is located less than a mile north of the Penshaw Monument on the Weardale Way and Great North Forest Heritage Trail walking routes. The park also includes the pretty Corgi Pond where you can see ducks and swans. To extend the walk head just a mile south east to visit Herrington Country Park. There's a fine sculpture trail, a boating lake, and a nature pond to enjoy here.",
