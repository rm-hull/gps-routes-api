The salt marshes below the village of Salthouse - an area encompassing 66 hectares of coastal grazing marsh populated by saltmarsh plants and traversed by brackish dykes and drains - are one of a number of important sites for migrating and breeding bird species such as avocet, redshank, lapwing, meadow pipit, skylark, reed bunting and sedge and reed warblers. A shingle bank protects the marshland from the North Sea."

The view is easterly, looking from past the beach car park at the end of Beach Road towards Gramborough Hill, the grassed over spit seen jutting out into the marshes in mid-distance. Gramborough Hill belongs to the National Trust. A Romano-British settlement once occupied this site - a grassed-over hill composed of gravels and sands and a thin layer of top soil - rising from the surrounding marsh to approximately 30 metres in height, offering good views across the surrounding land. It is believed that in Roman times the shoreline reached out into the sea for another mile and that the hill might have been situated on the edge of an estuary, with a fort guarding the entrance. A number of Roman bricks and pottery sherds have been found here over the years, with the most notable find (to-date) being a bronze bird (or duck). The chief feature of the site is a small pit, about 100 cm in diameter and 90 cm deep, sunk in the natural gravel."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around Salthouse on the Norfolk coast. You'll visit the local beaches before heading up to the nearby Kelling Heath. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north to the coast at Salthouse Marshes. This area is also a nature reserve and a great place to look out for a number of coastal birds. At Little Eye you pick up the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path and follow the waymarked trail along the beach to Gramborough Hill and Kelling Marsh, an area run by the National Trust with a rich Roman history. You continue east to the neighbouring village of Weybourne, turning inland to pass the settlement where you'll find the remains of the ancient priory and Grade II listed windmill. The route then climbs to the south towards Kelling Heath. There's a variety of footpaths to follow around the heath with good views from the elevated position of the site. You can pick up the heritage North Norfolk Railway from Kelling Heath Rail Station here too. The route heads west from the heath to Salthouse Heath, Three Halfpenny Hill to the north. The route then turns north to follow a country lane back to the village, passing Bard Hill on the way.",
