    "description": "This is a specatacular walk visiting four beautiful waterfalls near Ystradfellte in the Brecon Beacons. It is one of the best waterfall walks in Britain with delightful woodland gorges, riverside trails along the Afon Mellte and a series of roaring waterfalls. The popular trail starts at the Gwaun Hepste car park just south east of Ystradfellte. It's a good sized parking area which also includes a picnic area. From here you can pick up the trails to the Sgwd Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd Isaf Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd y Pannwr and Sgwd-yr-Eira waterfalls. Sgwd Isaf Clun-gwyn is a particularly impressive and powerful waterfall which will take your breath away. Sgwd yr Eira, is also noteworthy as probably the most photographed waterfall in the Brecon Beacons. You can actually walk behind the curtain of thundering water which is a great experience. There are also many other smaller waterfalls dotted around this area known as Waterfall Country. There are some challenging sections on the walk but the footpaths are well surfaced and maintained. The bottom half of the trail is on a circular loop with other trails branching off if you would like to extend the walk. You can see these on either of the detailed walking map links below. To continue your waterfall walking in the area try our longer Brecon Beacons Waterfall Walk. The 11 mile circular walk visits the Pontneddfechan Waterfalls and the Neath Waterfalls, to the west of the four falls.",
