  "description": "This walk takes you across Forth Road Bridge, a long-span suspension bridge spanning the\u00a0Firth of Forth, connecting\u00a0Edinburgh, at\u00a0South Queensferry, to\u00a0Fife, at\u00a0North Queensferry. You can walk or cycle across the bridge on one of the two paths located on the western and eastern side of the structure. It's a 1.5 mile walk across with some splendid views over the Firth of Forth to Dalgety Bay and the surrounding countryside. This walk starts on the southern side of the bridge at South Queensferry where there is a public car park close by. On the northern side of the bridge you can extend your walk by picking up the Fife Coastal Path at North Queensferry. The Dalgety Bay to Aberdour section of the trail can then be accessed a little further to the north. On the southern side there's the Blackness to South Queensferry Walk along the John Muir Way . Here you can visit the 15th century Blackness Castle and the expansive estate of Hopetoun House. Please Note: The bridge can be close to walkers in very high winds. Check the link below for weather and closure updates.",
