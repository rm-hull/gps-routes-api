  "description": "This Cambridgeshire based village lies just a few miles north of the famous university city of Cambridge. It includes a pretty village green, picturesque old almshouses, quaint thatched cottages and a church dating back to the 15th century. This circular walk takes you to the neighbouring village of Rampton. It includes a waterside section along Cottenham Lode which runs just to the north of the settlement. Rampton is also very pretty with the historic Giant's Hill castle mound and another nice village green. To continue your walking around Cottenham head west to visit one of the local highlights at Fen Drayton Lakes. There's some lovely waterside footpaths and lots of wildlife to look out for at the popular nature reserve.",
