  "description": "Explore the 820 acres of parkland surrounding this country house near Derby in the Peak District. The landscape features grassy meadows, serpentine lakes, pleasure grounds, woodland and contoured hills with clumps of trees. There are also sculptures, a summer house and an orangery. The walk gives fantastic views of the gardens, the hall and the surrounding countryside. The hall is a classical Palladian mansion built for the first Baron Scarsdale in the mid 18th century. Inside there are grand state rooms with fine collections of paintings and original furniture. The Centenary Way walking route runs just to the north of the grounds. You could pick this up and head towards Duffield or Brailsford to continue your walk. The Bonnie Prince Charlie Walk runs just to the south of the hall. Pick this up to head into Derby.",
