  "description": "The village of Boston Spa is located in the north eastern corner of the city of Leeds. There's some nice trails along the River Wharfe and the interesting neighbouring village of Thorpe Arch and Newton Kyme to visit. The attractive village has some fine Georgian architecture and several good shops and pubs in the centre. This walk explores the area to the east of the village, following the river to Newton Kyme and its castle ruins. It's easy walking with lovely views of the peaceful river, the rushing weir and the surrounding countryside. The walk starts on the Wharfe in Boston Spa and heads east along a section of the Ebor Way. You'll pass Ingle Bank Wood and Wharfe Bridge before coming to the site of an old Roman Fort. The path turns south here before picking up Croft Lane to take you into Newton Kyme. Here you can follow the path to the ruins fof Kyme Castle next to the river. The route then retraces its steps back to Wharfe Bridge where you can cross to the other side to visit the village of Thorp Arch, which sits opposite to Boston Spa. From here you cross another bridge to return to Boston Spa.",

Here you can visit the interesting ruins of the 14th century castle which is now run by English Heritage. The worthy village of Bramham is located just a few miles to the south. Here you can visit the noteworthy Bramham Park where there are hundreds of acres of parkland, gardens, woodland and countryside to explore. The landscaped park surrounds the historic 18th century Bramham House which is a Grade I listed building. You could also pick up the Leeds Country Way here and follow it to nearby Thorner."
