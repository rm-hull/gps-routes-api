    "description": "This Buckinghamshire based town is located on the eastern side of Milton Keynes. There's some lovely local parks and riverside trails to enjoy in this scenic area. The town also has a fascinating history with a fine old church and a noteworthy ancient bridge to see. This short walk in the town takes you to the River Great Ouse and the pretty Ousebank Gardens on the River Ouzel. You can then cross the river to visit Castle Meadows where there are some pleasant footpaths. Ousebank Gardens are very pretty with wildlife, picnic areas and nice views of the old church. To continue your walking around Newport Pagnell head west to visit the lovely Linford Lakes where you can enjoy waterside trails along the Grand Union Canal. Just to the south there's Willen Lake, an excellent place for easy walks and bird watching near the town.",
