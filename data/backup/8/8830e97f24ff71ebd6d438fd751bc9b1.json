      "caption": "Mentmore Towers - Side Entrance. These spectacular gates are only the side entrance to the magnificent pile that is Mentmore Towers. The house, known usually simply as \"Mentmore\" or \"The Mansion\" was built for Baron Mayer de Rothschild between 1852 & 1854. It was subsequently the home of Lord Roseberry (a member of the Rothschild family by marriage). It was mooted at one time that Prince Charles might come to live here, but he decided on Highgrove instead. After a period where it was unused it was taken over by the \"Natural Law Party\" - the famous \"Yogic Fliers\". They, I believe, have now sold it on, and it is to become an exclusive 6* hotel. Much of the grounds to the south of the house now form Mentmore Golf Course."
