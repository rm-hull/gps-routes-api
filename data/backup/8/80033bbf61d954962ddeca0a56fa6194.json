  "description": "This attractive town in Northumberland is surrounded by lovely countryside and a number of large parks which are ideal for walkers. The main highlight is the expansive Hulne Park located right next to the town. It's proximity to the wonderful Northumberland Coast also presents a number of good walking options. You could visit the atmospheric ruins of Dunstanburgh Castle or pick up the long distance St Oswald's Way. Our Alnwick to Bamburgh Walk links the two historic castles using the coastal path. This short walk takes you around Alnwick Castle and Alnwick Gardens in the town centre. You start off at the impressive castle which dominates the western side of the town. The Grade I listed building dates from the 11th century, built following the Norman conquest, and renovated and remodelled a number of times. As well as admiring the fine architecture you can visit the exhibitions where you can see frescoes from Pompeii, relics from Ancient Egypt and Romano-British objects. The castle is open to the public throughout the summer months. After exploring the castle and grounds you can then stroll round to the wonderful Alnwick Garden. There's well laid out footpaths here to take you to various themed plantings designed around a central water cascade. Also of note is the huge wooden treehouse and the Poision Garden which features a number of intoxicating and poisonous plants. After exploring the garden you can stroll through woodland up to the River Aln before returning to the castle. To extend the walk cross the river and head west to visit the nearby Alnwick Abbey. An architecturally impressive 14th century gatehouse still remains of the abbey which was originally founded in the 12th century. You can virtually explore the castle and grounds using the Google Street View link below!",
