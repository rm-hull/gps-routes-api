  "description": "This walk takes you along the Lagoon Walk and then around the boating lake in the popular coastal town of Skegness. It's a pretty area with good sea views and easy footpaths suitable for all abilities. The walk runs for about 2 miles so it will probably take around 45 minutes at a gentle pace. There's a public car park right next to the lagoon walk on the sea front. The route is also just a short hop from the train station. To extend the walk head a short way north of the lake and enjoy a stroll along the pier. If you head south you can explore the sand dunes and visit the lovely Gibraltar Point. The National Nature Reserve includes numerous footpaths to follow through the sand, saltmarsh and dunes with several artificial lakes and bird hides along the way. It's one of the highlights of the area and another great place for a walk on this stretch of coast.",

      "content": "About 11 miles inland you can visit the noteworthy town of Alford. The historic market town includes the splendid Alford Manor House, a 13th century church and the five sailed Alford Windmill. If you head north along the coast you can visit Chapel St Leonards, Sutton on Sea and Mablethorpe. This pleasant town has a lovely promenade and some attractive coastal gardens to visit. You could reach the settlements on on the Mablethorpe To Skegness Cycle Route as this is mostly suitable for walkers. Head a few miles inland and you could pay a visit to Gunby Hall. The historic hall is one of the area highlights with 8 acres of beautiful gardens, an 18th century manor and an expansive country estate. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lincolnshire Walks page."
