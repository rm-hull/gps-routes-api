  "description": "This walk takes you along the Lagoon Walk and then around the boating lake in the popular coastal town of Skegness. It's a pretty area with good sea views and easy footpaths suitable for all abilities. The walk runs for about 2 miles so it will probably take around 45 minutes at a gentle pace. There's a public car park right next to the lagoon walk on the sea front. The route is also just a short hop from the train station. To extend the walk head a short way north of the lake and enjoy a stroll along the pier. If you head south you can explore the sand dunes and visit the lovely Gibraltar Point . The National Nature Reserve includes numerous footpaths to follow through the sand, saltmarsh and dunes with several artificial lakes and bird hides along the way. It's one of the highlights of the area and another great place for a walk on this stretch of coast.",
