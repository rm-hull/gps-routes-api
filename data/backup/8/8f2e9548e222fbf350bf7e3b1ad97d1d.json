  "description": "This walk visits the wonderful Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve near Golspie and Dornoch. The coastal reserve is a splendid place with nature trails and lots of wildlife to look out for. Habitats on the site include tidal basin, sand dunes, shingle ridges and attractive pine woodland including Balbair Wood and Ferry Wood. The area is great for wildlife with seals, otters and various wildfowl to look out for. This walk starts from the Mound car park but you could also head to Littleferry where there's a lovely coastal path with sand dunes and sea views. See the video below for more details of this.",
