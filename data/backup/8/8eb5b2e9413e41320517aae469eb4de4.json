  "description": "This walk takes you around the beautiful Loch Garten RSPB Nature Reserve and also visits the nearby Loch Mallachie in the Cairngorms. You start at the Loch Garten Osprey Centre at the north eastern side of the loch. Here you can observe the birds nesting in the Caledonian pineforest, visit the excellent visitor centre and view the birds on the live CCTV camera. There are a number of splendid nature trails to follow through the forest and along the pretty loch. Look out for wildlife which includes red squirrels, dragonflies, crested tits and, in early spring, the capercaillie. The walk continues on woodland trails to the smaller, but still delightful, Loch Mallachie. It's a glorious area with the Cairngorms mountains making a splendid backdrop. The Speyside Way passes nearby so you can pick this up if you would like to extend your walk. You could also head east into the expansive Abernethy Forest where there are miles of trails to follow. The woods include the River Nethy and a series of pretty lochs and streams.",
