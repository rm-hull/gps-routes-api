  "description": "This circular walk takes you along a section of the South West Coast Path from Padstow to the lovely beach at Trevone Bay. The walk runs for just under 7 miles with the opening section running north to Harbour Cove, Hawker's Cove and Stepper Point with wonderful views over Padstow Bay. At Trevone Bay you will find a gorgeous Blue Flag beach surrounded by cliffs and little sheltered alcoves. There's also a popular cafe where you can refresh yourself before the return leg. The little village of Trevone lies just to the south of the bay. You can follow country lanes to the village before picking up a footpath heading south east to return you to Padstow. This route is a direct point to point walk on country lanes and footpaths. If you'd like to reach the bay using the coastal path then try the Stepper Point Walk which takes you along the South West Coast Path. If you feel like extending your exercise then continue west along the coast path to the lovely Trevose Head and lighthouse. The route passes close to Prideaux Place where there are gardens and a deer park.",

      "content": "One nice idea is to catch the ferry over the river to Rock on the other side of the estuary from Padstow. Here you can pick up the Rock to Polzeath Walk which heads north along Daymer Bay to the lovely beach at Polzeath. Here you can pick up the Polzeath to Port Isaac Walk and visit the noteworthy village of Port Isaac. The picturesque settlement has been made famous by ITV's 'Doc Martin', featuring Martin Clunes. The popular Camel Trail starts/finishes in Padstow. You could pick up the trail and follow it south to the attractive market town of Wadebridge where there's some good mountain bike trails in the nearby Grogley Woods. The Saints Way starts in the town. This long distance trail takes you across the county from Padstow in the north to Fowey on the south coast. It follows the probable route of early Christian travellers making their way from Ireland to the Continent.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
