  "description": "This route follows the Ardmore Cliff Walk in County Waterford, Ireland. It's a very popular coastal walk with some amazing cliff top views and interesting local history. The trail runs for a distance of just over a mile on reasonable easy paths with a steady incline. You can start the walk from the car park at the Cliff Hotel. From here you pick up the footpath and head south east past Saint Declan's Holy Well and the ruins of an ancient church. The route follows the coast path round to Ardmore Head before turning south to the Samson Shipwreck and the Look out Post and Ardmore Watchtower. Continue round and the route will lead you to AFC Ardmore where you finish. You can turn it into a circular walk by continuing north from the football ground to the Ardmore Round Tower which dates back to the 12th century.",
