  "description": "This route follows the Ardmore Cliff Walk in County Waterford, Ireland. It's a very popular coastal walk with some amazing cliff top views and interesting local history. The trail runs for a distance of just over a mile on reasonable easy paths with a steady incline. You can start the walk from the car park at the Cliff Hotel. From here you pick up the footpath and head south east past Saint Declan's Holy Well and the ruins of an ancient church. The route follows the coast path round to Ardmore Head before turning south to the Samson Shipwreck and the Look out Post and Ardmore Watchtower. Continue round and the route will lead you to AFC Ardmore where you finish. You can turn it into a circular walk by continuing north from the football ground to the Ardmore Round Tower which dates back to the 12th century.",

This fine circular walk provides wonderful views over Cork Harbour and visits the 16th century Camden Fort Meagher. To the north of Crosshaven there's the 13th century Blarney Castle to explore. The ancient castle is surrounded by some beautiful grounds and gardens with miles of footpaths to enjoy. Near here there's the circular Cork Marina Walk where you can enjoy fine views over the River Lee and a visit to the 16th century Blackrock Castle. To the north east are the stunning Comeragh Mountains where you can try the popular Coumshingaun Lake Loop Walk or visit the picturesque Mahon Falls. To the north is the historic town of Dungarvan where you can enjoy a walk along the town's lovely harbour and see the ancient castle. In nearby Youghal there's the Knockadoon Cliff Walk. Here you can enjoy fine views of Capel Island from Knockadoon Head. In Youghal itself there's also the Youghal Beach Boardwalk to try. The popular walk follows a splendid long boardwalk connecting the 3 beaches of the town. To the west of Youghal you can also pick up the first section of the Midleton To Youghal Greenway. The shared cycling and walking trail will eventually run all the way to Youghal along the old railway line."
