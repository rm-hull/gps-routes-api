The airfield opened as RFC Hainault Farm to counter the treat of Zeppelin raids in WW1, the base closed in 1919. The City of London Corporation bought the site before WW2 intending it to be London Airport but the site was requisitioned by the air ministry and a military base constructed. Operations began in November 1941 the base was used by Spitfires, Hurricane (fighter bomber version) and Typhoons it closed in 1946. I may be a tad romantic thinking this is a wartime survivor it is more likely to be associated with the gravel extraction that destroyed almost all vestiges of the aerodrome and created the lakes"

  "description": "This large park in Ilford includes sailing and angling lakes, an 18-hole golf course, a boulder park, an outdoor activity centre and a number of newly developed footpaths. It's also good for wildlife spotting with several species of water loving bird visiting the lakes. The park is located close to Fairlop tube station which is in Zone 4 on the Central line of the London Underground. Just over a mile to the north east you can continue your walking around Hainault Forest Country Park. There's over 300 acres to explore by bike or on foot in this popular park. The epic London Loop can also be picked up here.",

      "content": "One nice idea is to head a little to the north and pick up the London Loop and follow it to Havering Country Park. Just to the south there's Valentines Park. The parkland and gardens here surround the 17th century Valentines Mansion. The circular walk from Loughton explores the area to the north of the park from the nearby town's London Underground station. It's an attractive place worthy of exploration with dozens of historic listed buildings and three conservation areas. The route also visits the Roding Valley Meadows nature reserve on the River Roding, the aforementioned Hainault Forest Country Park and part of Epping Forest. For more walking ideas in the area see the London Walks page."
