The airfield opened as RFC Hainault Farm to counter the treat of Zeppelin raids in WW1, the base closed in 1919. The City of London Corporation bought the site before WW2 intending it to be London Airport but the site was requisitioned by the air ministry and a military base constructed. Operations began in November 1941 the base was used by Spitfires, Hurricane (fighter bomber version) and Typhoons it closed in 1946. I may be a tad romantic thinking this is a wartime survivor it is more likely to be associated with the gravel extraction that destroyed almost all vestiges of the aerodrome and created the lakes"
