  "description": "This walk takes you through a beautiful wooded valley to the stunning beach at Pwll Du Bay. It's a delightful tranquil area with the running water of the river and interesting flora and fauna. The walk starts in Kittle and follows footpaths south through the Bishopston Valley. The paths runs along the river which is surrounded by woodland and little caves. You continue through wet meadows grazed by cattle and home to various wildflowers before coming to the delightfully secluded Pwll Du Bay. Here you can enjoy a stroll along the beach and take in the wonderful coastal views of the Gower. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head a mile or so west and visit the ruins of Pennard Castle and explore the beautiful Pennard Burrows. If you head east along the coast towards Swansea you can visit the lovely beach at Caswell Bay and explore the popular Mumbles where there are more nice coastal walking paths. The valley is located just a few miles south west of Swansea.",
