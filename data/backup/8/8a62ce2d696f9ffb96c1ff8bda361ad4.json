Much of the walk follows ancient footpaths and bridleways, visiting the picturesque villages of Wales, Harthill, Thorpe Salvin, South Anston and Todwick where you can see some of Rotherham\u2019s finest church architecture. There also views of the Chesterfield Canal and the ruins of Thorpe Hall to enjoy on this interesting walk. The path passes close to Harthill Reservoir where there's the option of taking a short detour and following the surfaced path around the water. Pebley Reservoir is also located close to here.",

The pub still retains its country feel, mixed with a modern and friendly atmosphere. There's a good menu and a nice outdoor seating with country views, where you can relax in the summer months. You can find the pub in the village at 16 Union Street with a postcode of S267YH for your sat navs."

In this area you could also visit The Tropical Butterfly House in North Anston. There's much to see here with free flying butterflies, tropical birds, creepy crawlies and reptiles. Outside there's also a lively family of meerkats. You can find them at postcode S25 4EQ."
