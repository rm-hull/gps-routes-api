  "description": "Visit five historic churches on this circular walk in South Rotherham. Much of the walk follows ancient footpaths and bridleways, visiting the picturesque villages of Wales, Harthill, Thorpe Salvin, South Anston and Todwick where you can see some of Rotherham\u2019s finest church architecture. There also views of the Chesterfield Canal and the ruins of Thorpe Hall to enjoy on this interesting walk. The path passes close to Harthill Reservoir where there's the option of taking a short detour and following the surfaced path around the water. Pebley Reservoir is also located close to here.",
