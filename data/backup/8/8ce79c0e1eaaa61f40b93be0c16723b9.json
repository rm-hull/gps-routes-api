  "description": "This historic Aberdeenshire based town sits at the confluence of the rivers Ury and Don. This circular walk takes you along the river Don before exploring the Keith Hall Estate to the east of the town. The historic estate includes woodland footpaths and fine views back to the town and surrounding hills. To continue your walking in the area head west to the Bennachie Hills. The hills are one of the walking highlights of the area with more woodland walks around the forest and the popular climb to Mither Tap. For some more local history there's the 15th century Castle Fraser. The castle is surrounded by attractive grounds with two waymarked walks to try. To the south east there's also the expansive Kirkhill Forest .",
