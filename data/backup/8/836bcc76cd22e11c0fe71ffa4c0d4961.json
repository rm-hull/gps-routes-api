  "description": "This short circular walk visits the Blackhead Lighthouse located near Whitehead in County Antrim. The lighthouse sits in a splendid location at the northern end of Belfast Lough where it opens out into the North Channel that separates Northern Ireland and Scotland. The walk starts near the small parking area at the lighthouse. From here you can pick up the Blackhead Path and follow it around the site for about 1 mile. It's a splendid cliff top path with excellent views in all directions. The walk can be extend by continuing along the coast path to Whitehead. You could start the walk from the train station here and follow the cliff top path north to the site.",
