  "description": "This short circular walk visits the Blackhead Lighthouse located near Whitehead in County Antrim. The lighthouse sits in a splendid location at the northern end of Belfast Lough where it opens out into the North Channel that separates Northern Ireland and Scotland. The walk starts near the small parking area at the lighthouse. From here you can pick up the Blackhead Path and follow it around the site for about 1 mile. It's a splendid cliff top path with excellent views in all directions. The walk can be extend by continuing along the coast path to Whitehead. You could start the walk from the train station here and follow the cliff top path north to the site.",

      "content": "The path was the precursor to the more dramatic Gobbins Cliff Path, a few miles further north along the coast. Head towards Belfast and you can continue your walking in Redburn Country Park where there are fine views to Belfast Lough, Belfast Harbour, George Best City Airport, Belfast Castle and Cave Hill Country Park. To the north west you can enjoy a climb to the popular Slemish Mountain. There's excellent views over the area from the summit of this viewpoint near Broughshane. To the west there's the Woodburn Forest near Carrickfergus. Here you'll find miles of good woodland trails and a number of attractive reservoirs. Also nearby is the Glenoe Waterfall. The picturesque falls are located in the pretty village of Glenoe in County Antrim. It's a fine place for a walk with pleasant trails taking you through peaceful woodland to the 30ft high waterfall. For more walking ideas in the area see the Belfast Walks page."
