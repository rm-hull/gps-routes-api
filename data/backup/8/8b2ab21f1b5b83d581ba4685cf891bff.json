  "description": "This large area of woodland in south west Sheffield has miles of good walking trails to try. There's over 300 acres to explore with a network of signed footpaths to follow through the deciduous woodland and along the pretty streams. It's particularly lovely in the spring when there are lots of pretty bluebells to see. There's also good facilities with a car park off Abbeydale Road and a nice cafe where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. The long distance Sheffield Round Walk passes through the woods so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Heading west will take you to Whirlowbrook Park, Limb Valley woods and Ringinglow where you can visit Lady Canning's Plantation. Here you will find a Blue graded mountain bike trail which twists and turns through berms and rollers from top to bottom. Also nearby is the fascinating Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet and Millhouses Park where there are lovely trails along the River Sheaf. Other highlights on the Sheffield Round include Endcliffe Park and the lovely Sheffield Botanical Gardens .",
