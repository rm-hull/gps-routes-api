  "description": "This Northumberland based town is located just east of Newcastle. The attractive town has some expensive residential areas which are popular with footballers and celebrities. For walkers there's some nice riverside trails along the River Pont in the pleasant town centre. There's also good countryside trails leading to the nearby Hadrian's Wall and the River Tyne which lie to the south of the settlement. This walk from the town takes you to the neighbouring village of Heddon on the Wall where you can pick up the epic Hadrian's Wall Path and follow it to Whittle Dene Reservoir . The walk starts on the River Pont in the town centre and then follows a dismantled railway line south west through Darras Hall. This will take you out into the countryside around Medburn where you pick up trails heading south to Breckney Hill and Heddon on the Wall. Here you pick up the waymarked National Trail and follow it west along the wall to the Vindobala Roman Fort at Rudchester. The fort guards the valley of the March Burn to the west, an ancient route leading to the south towards the Tyne ford at\u00a0Newburn. The name Vindobala means \u201cWhite Strength\u201d with the troops recruited from a coastal tribe of\u00a0Lower Germany. At the site there's an information board which will tell you all about the history of the area. From the fort you continue west to Harlow Hill before coming to Whittle Dene Reservoir. There are nice trails you can follow around the large lake before returning to Ponteland on the same paths. Part of this walk is coincident with the Newcastle Walk which starts in the nearby city and visits the Tyne Riverside Country Park in Ovingham . For an alternative circular walk around the town see the video below. This walk takes you to some of the highlights in the town including the riverside Ponteland Park and the historic 1400 Pele tower.",
