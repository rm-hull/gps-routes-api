  "description": "This route visits a pretty reservoir near Peterlee and Stockton-on-Tees. The reservoir is in a nice rural spot where the River Skerne is joined by Hurworth Burn anout 3 miles from its source. There's a good circular trail to follow around the water running for about 1.5 miles. It's a peaceful place with a number of benches where you can rest and enjoy the fine country views across the water. The walk starts from the car park at the southern end of the reservoir, just off the Hurworth Burn Road. It's located just a few miles east of Trimden. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north along the Castle Eden Walkway. This shared cycling and walking trail will take you along the eastern side of the water before turning west around Black Hurworth. You can then follow alternative footpaths along the western side before returning to the car park.",
