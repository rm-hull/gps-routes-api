  "description": "This route visits a pretty reservoir near Peterlee and Stockton-on-Tees. The reservoir is in a nice rural spot where the River Skerne is joined by Hurworth Burn anout 3 miles from its source. There's a good circular trail to follow around the water running for about 1.5 miles. It's a peaceful place with a number of benches where you can rest and enjoy the fine country views across the water. The walk starts from the car park at the southern end of the reservoir, just off the Hurworth Burn Road. It's located just a few miles east of Trimden. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north along the Castle Eden Walkway. This shared cycling and walking trail will take you along the eastern side of the water before turning west around Black Hurworth. You can then follow alternative footpaths along the western side before returning to the car park.",

      "content": "If you pick up the Castle Eden Walkway and follow it south it will take you to the excellent Wynyard Woodland Park. This country park in Billingham has woodland trails, a wildflower meadow and a planetarium and observatory. If you head north then there's the popular Castle Eden Dene. This National Nature Reserve is a fine place for a stroll with its pretty streams and peaceful woodland trails. On the western side of the reserve you can pick up National Cycle Route 14 and the Haswell to Hart Countryside Walkway. The multi-user trail uses the trackbed of a disused railway line to travel between the two old stations. For more walking ideas in the area see the County Durham Walks page."
