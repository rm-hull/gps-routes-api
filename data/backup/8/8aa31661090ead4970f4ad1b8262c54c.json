  "description": "This walk takes you to the beautiful Hareshaw Linn waterfall in the Northumberland National Park. The walk begins in the village of Bellingham and follows footpaths through ancient woodland and over six bridges to the 9 metre high waterfall. On the way you will pass a series of smaller waterfalls on the pretty Hareshaw Burn. Look out for wildlife including red squirrels, great spotted woodpeckers, wood warblers, badgers and bats on the way. The Pennine Way runs past the falls so you could pick this up to continue your walking in the area.",

You can enjoy a range of light lunches, freshly baked scones and homemade cakes on-board the old 1957 Mark 1 Carriages. The restored Carriage's still contain the original seats and many of the original fixtures and fittings from when the train was last used for public service. They do a very good afternoon tea for a reasonable price. You can find the cafe at Station Yard, Woodburn Road, Bellingham with a postcodfe of NE48 2DG for your sat navs. The Cheviot Hotel is another good option in the village.

The centre tells the stories of the people of the North Tyne and Rede valleys through text, imagery, and objects. The displays present the social, agricultural and industrial history of the area as well as a small section about the earlier Border Reivers. It's a great place to visit particularly for railway and photgraphy buffs. It also includes the Carriages tea rooms mentioned above."
