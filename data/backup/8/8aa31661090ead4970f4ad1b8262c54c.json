  "description": "This walk takes you to the beautiful Hareshaw Linn waterfall in the Northumberland National Park. The walk begins in the village of Bellingham and follows footpaths through ancient woodland and over six bridges to the 9 metre high waterfall. On the way you will pass a series of smaller waterfalls on the pretty Hareshaw Burn. Look out for wildlife including red squirrels, great spotted woodpeckers, wood warblers, badgers and bats on the way. The Pennine Way runs past the falls so you could pick this up to continue your walking in the area.",
