  "description": "Follow the waterside trail through this delightful nature reserve in the North York Moors National Park. The easy walk follows a wooden boardwalk through the wooded valley along the River Derwent (not suitable for bikes). There's a wide variety of flora and fauna to look out for as you make your way through the reserve. This includes wild garlic, wood anemone and broadleaved woodland. Also keep your eyes peeled for deer and woodland birds. It's easy to extend your walking in the area with Raincliffe Woods located just to the north west. The woods have some good mountain bike trails and more walking trails. You can also pick up the circular Scarborough Sea Cut and Scalby Beck Walk in this area. Also nearby is Wykeham Forest which has some great viewpoints from its elevated position. The circular Hackness Walk visits the forest from the nearby village. You can follow a pleasant riverside path along the River Derwent from the settlement to the forest. The expansive Dalby Forest is also close at hand. Forge Valley is located just north of the villages of West Ayton and East Ayton. In West Ayton you can visit the photogenic 14th ruins of Ayton castle as an extension to the walk..",
