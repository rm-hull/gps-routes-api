  "description": "This nice tree lined bridleway in Devizes makes for a nice easy afternoon stroll. The pleasant path runs for about a mile from the canal to Roundway, using a section of the Wessex Ridgeway Trail. The historic path is believed to go back more than 700 years to the reign of King Edward I. The walk starts on the canal by the Grade II listed Gates and Lodge which originally marked the southern end of Lord Roundway's estate. You then follow the path north for about a mile, finishing at Roundway. You can extend the walk by continuing along the long distance trail to Roundway Hill, the site of a famous Civil War battle where a Royalist cavalry force under Lord Wilmot won a crushing victory over the Parliamentarians in 1643. You can also try the Devizes and Caen Hill Locks walk along the Kennet and Avon Canal.",
