  "description": "This walk takes you around an area of common land in Hamble-le-Rice in Hampshire. The common has a waymarked trail to follow to ponds, heathland, oak woodland, meadow, salt-marsh, mudflats and a shingle beach on the River Hamble. It's great for flora and fauna with purple moor-grass, rhododendrons and gorse. Look out for birds such as oystercatchers, turnstones, herons and ringed plovers around the mudflats and the creek.",
