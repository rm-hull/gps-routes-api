  "description": "This coastal nature reserve in Lincolnshire consists of dunes, slacks and inter-tidal areas. It's a great place for birdwatching with 47 species of birds to look out for. In November and December you can see the grey seal colony give birth to their pups near the sand dunes. It's quite a spectacle and attracts thousands of visitors each year. This circular walk starts at the car park and takes you along the coast and then into the surrounding countryide on footpaths and country lanes. You'll visit the nearby villages of Grainthorpe and North Somercotes before returning to the reserve car park. To continue your walking in the area head just a few miles west to visit Covenham Reservoir. There's some lovely waterside trails and lots of birdlife to look out for here. You can also pick up the Louth Canal and enjoy a walk along the towpath, just to the east of the reservoir.",

The historic village also includes a series of listed buildings including a 13th century church, a 19th century windmill and two fine local pubs dating back hundreds of years."
