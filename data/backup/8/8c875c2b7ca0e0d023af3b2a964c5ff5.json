  "description": "This little Monmouthshire village lies in an elevated position just to the south of Monmouth. Penallt includes a pretty village green, an ancient 14th century church and a noteworthy old pub dating back to the 1600s. The surrounding area is a great place for walkers with the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley to explore. This circular walk from the village visits some local highlights including the River Wye, Monmouth, the Monmouth Viaduct and Livox Wood. The route uses a section of the Wye Valley Walk, a long distance waymarked walking trail running through the area. You can pick this up just to the south east of the settlement, at Lower Redbrook. Follow it north and it will take you towards The Kymin where there are some splendid views over the area. The area also includes the Old Church Wood Nature Reserve where you can look out for a variety of wildlife including pied flycatchers, nuthatches, tree pipits, treecreeperss and sparrowhawks.",
