  "description": "This circular walk takes you to Burbage Rocks and the Burbage Brook in the Peak District. On the trail you'll pass lots of interesting rock formations where you will often see climbers. There's also fine views from the elevated position of the ridge and some pleasant waterside walking along the pretty brook which runs through the area. The walk starts from the Upper Burbage Bridge Car Park which you can find on the Ringinglow Road at a postcode of S32 1BR. It's located about 2 miles north east of Hathersage. From the car park you can pick up trails heading south east up to Burbage Rocks on Burbage Moor. The path then loops round to pick up the Burbage Brook and follow the waterway north back to the car park. The scenery around the brook is very pretty with an 18th century packhorse bridge to look out for on the way. There's also some nice woodland trails and views to Hathersage Moor which lies to the west of the brook. The Sheffield Country Walk crosses Burbage Moor. The circular long distance trail is a great way of extending your walking in the area. You could follow it north to visit one of the Peak District's highlights at Stanage Edge .",
