  "description": "This circular walk takes you to Burbage Rocks and the Burbage Brook in the Peak District. On the trail you'll pass lots of interesting rock formations where you will often see climbers. There's also fine views from the elevated position of the ridge and some pleasant waterside walking along the pretty brook which runs through the area. The walk starts from the Upper Burbage Bridge Car Park which you can find on the Ringinglow Road at a postcode of S32 1BR. It's located about 2 miles north east of Hathersage. From the car park you can pick up trails heading south east up to Burbage Rocks on Burbage Moor. The path then loops round to pick up the Burbage Brook and follow the waterway north back to the car park. The scenery around the brook is very pretty with an 18th century packhorse bridge to look out for on the way. There's also some nice woodland trails and views to Hathersage Moor which lies to the west of the brook. The Sheffield Country Walk crosses Burbage Moor. The circular long distance trail is a great way of extending your walking in the area. You could follow it north to visit one of the Peak District's highlights at Stanage Edge .",

      "content": "For an alternative circular route in the area try the Higger Tor Walk which visits the adjacent viewpoint. The brook runs south into the National Trust's Longshaw Estate where there are miles woodland and country trails to try. Eventually it comes to the splendid Padley Gorge which is another walking highlight of the area. On the eastern side of Burbage Moor you will find Lady Canning's Plantation. This area of woodland is popular with mountain bikers and walkers. Just to the south west there's Millstone Edge where there's some wonderful rock formations and the old millstones from the Millstone Edge Quarry. The climb to Owler Tor can also be started from the same Surprise View car park here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
