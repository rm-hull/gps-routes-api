  "description": "This historic small town is located close to Stone and Stafford in the county of Staffordshire. The town has a particularly interesting high street with a number of Georgian buildings to admire. There's also a noteworthy 12th century church and a 13th century castle. This walk from the town visits Eccleshall Castle, Elford Heath and the pretty Cop Mere to the west of the settlement. The walk starts at Eccleshall Castle which is located just to the north west of the town centre. The castle is not open to the public but a public footpath runs past the southern side of the site. The castle dates from the 13th century and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade II* listed building. The route then heads west past Elford Heath and Pershall where you can enjoy views of the River Sow. You continue past Platt Bridge before coming to Cop Mere where there is a woodland footpath running along the northern side of the water.",

Head west and you could pick up the Shropshire Union Canal. Just to the south there's the lovely Aqualate Mere. There's a pleasant waterside path to pick up at this large, scenic lake. The site is one of the area's highlights and notable as the largest natural lake in the English Midlands. Just to the west of here there's the market town of Newport where you can enjoy another waterside stroll along the old Newport Canal.
