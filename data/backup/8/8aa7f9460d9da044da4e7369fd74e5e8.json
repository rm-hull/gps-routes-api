  "description": "Enjoy woodland trails and riverside paths on this walk in the heart of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. Although most of the park lies on or near the coast this area is unusual in that it lies several miles inland. The little village of Lawrenny lies on a peninsula of the Cleddau estuary. The walk starts from the pretty Lawrenny Quay where this is a yacht club, pub and the popular tea rooms. The walk then picks up the Landsker Borderlands Trail and passes through Lawrenny Wood with views of the Daugleddau River. There are also nice glimpses through the trees to Benton Castle on the other side of the river. You continue along the Daugleddau to Garron Pill where you can either head south to Lawrenny village or you can just return the same way. At the end of your walk you can reward yourself with food and drink at the splendid Lawrenny Quayside where you can sit outside and enjoy great views of the river. If you would like to continue your walk then you could head east along the Cresswell River to Cresswell Quay, using the Landsker Borderlands Trail. Carew Castle is also nearby, just a few miles south of Cresswell Quay.",

You can stroll around the pleasant castle grounds and enjoy some fine views of the millpond and the River Pembroke in the attractive town. On the opposite side of the river there's Llangwm where there's more pleasant trails along the estuary. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pembrokeshire Coast Walks page."
