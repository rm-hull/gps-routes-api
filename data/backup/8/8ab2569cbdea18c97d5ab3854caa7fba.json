It was established in 1984 and offers a shared way of life providing support and challenges for men and women with special needs. The Creamery provides work for some of the community members, who produce award-winning cheeses, butter and yoghurts which along with farm produce and crafts are sold in the shop. There are now Camphill Communities in more than 20 countries. The first community was founded in 1940 at Camphill, near Aberdeen, by Karl Konig, an Austrian doctor who had come to Scotland as a refugee."

  "description": "This walk visits the Loch Arthur Community in Beeswing, Dumfries. The picturesque loch has been claimed as the setting for the Arthurian story of the Lady of the Lake. The community includes eleven houses in which more than 75 people live, including about twenty-eight people in supported tenancies. Here people with learning disabilities live alongside volunteers in a way that 'recognises the dignity and uniqueness of each human being and does not distinguish between those who are called disabled and those who are not'. There is a farm, a large garden, a creamery, a bakery, craft workshops and a thriving farm shop and cafe. You can explore the farm and creamery before following a path east to visit the loch.",
