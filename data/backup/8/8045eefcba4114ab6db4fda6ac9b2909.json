  "description": "This walk explores the estate of Stoneleigh Abbey near Kenilworth in Warwickshire. The 16th century house is surrounded by a beautiful country estate with woodland, landscaped parkland and gardens. It's a lovely place for a stroll with some wonderful architecture including a 14th century gatehouse. There's also nice views of the River Avon which runs through the park. To extend your walking in the area head east into Stoneleigh village where you can pick up the Coventry Way and the Warwickshire Centenary Way. Heading east along the Coventry Way would take you to Bubbenhall and the delightful Ryton Pools Country Park where there's more woodland trails and a series of pretty lakes. Heading west would take you to Kenilworth where you can explore the historic castle.",
