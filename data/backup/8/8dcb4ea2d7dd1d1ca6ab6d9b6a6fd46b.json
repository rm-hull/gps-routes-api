  "description": "This challenging circular walk visits Grindslow Knoll and Grindsbrook Clough in Edale in the Peak District. It's a beautiful area with interesting rock formations and wonderful sweeping views over the Peak District. The walk starts from the pretty village of Edale which can be reached by train from Manchester or Sheffield. You then ascend to the Nab where there are splendid views of the Hope Valley. You continue to Ringing Roger where you will find a fascinating formation of weathered rocks and another fabulous viewpoint. The route continues along the spectacular Kinder Plateau, passing Nether Tor and Upper Tor before reaching Grindsbrook Clough. There is a popular alternative footpath here which runs along the Grindsbrook Clough back to Edale. It's a lovely waterside section along the Grinds Brook with pretty waterfalls along the way. This route, however continues to the summit of Grindslow Knoll, where there are great views of the Kinder Plateau, the Hope Valley and the Great Ridge.  From here, the walk descends back to Edale where you can enjoy refreshments at the Old Nags Head pub. The pub is famous for being the start of the Pennine Way long distance walk.",
