Aside from the use of the word pleasantest (which I've surprisingly since discovered is in the dictionary) by the information board nearby - I could hardly argue - this seat has a lovely view of the castle and surrounding area - and who could also complain about its immediate surrounds... Most pleasant. I've since discovered that the quote used in the title is from Giraldus Cambrensis, a chronicler from the 12th-13th century who was born in the castle."

  "description": "This Norman castle near Tenby is well worth a visit. It includes pretty gardens and sits next to the coast so you can easily extend your walk to the nearby Manorbier Bay. From the top of the castle there are excellent views of the surrounding coast and countryside. After you have explored the castle grounds, the gardens, the dovecote and mill you can enjoy a short stroll to the delightful Manorbier Beach. The trail will take you south to Parson's Piece and the caves at Priest's Nose. Here you could pick up the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and enjoy a walk along Manorbier Bay which lies just to the west. See the Manorbier to Freshwater East Walk for more details on this area.",
