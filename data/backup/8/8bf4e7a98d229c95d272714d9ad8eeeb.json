But there is also a building on the north bank, connected by an enclosed bridge. On a Monday morning in early March, it was really quiet between the buildings, the loudest sound was the ducks quacking. Think of it 150 years ago when barges would have been loading and unloading at the large doors on the ground floor in the foreground."

  "description": "This Victorian model village and UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of the highlights of the Bradford area. The wonderfully preserved village includes the grade II listed Victoria Hall and Salt's Mill with its shops, cafes and galleries. You can explore the village with its wonderful buildings and history before picking up the Leeds and Liverpool Canal towpath to take you to the splendid Bingley 5 rise locks. This route also takes you into the lovely Roberts Park just over the water. The park is grade II listed in English Heritage's Register of Parks and Gardens. It links to Shipley Glen where there are nice woodland trails along a pretty beck and the super Shipley Glen Tramway. It is the oldest funicular tramway in the UK. You can ride the railway for a small fee. The River Aire also runs through the village so you can also pick up the riverside footpath to further explore the area. Head west and and you can visit the country park at Bingley St Ives. Here you'll find woodland, gardens, ponds and parkland set in a wonderful 500 acre estate. A few miles to the south you will find the delightful Chellow Dene Reservoir. You can virtually explore the Saltaire village using the google street view link below!",
