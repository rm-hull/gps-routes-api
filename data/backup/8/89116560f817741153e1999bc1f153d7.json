  "description": "This East Sussex based town is a great place for cliff top coastal walking. There's a lovely beach and long promenade with other local highlights including the wonderful Seven Sisters cliffs and a wildlife rich nature reserve. This circular walk explores the Seaford Head Nature Reserve before heading to the nearby Cuckmere River and Cuckmere Haven. The reserve is a wonderful place for flora and fauna with butterflies such as Chalkhill Blue, Silver-spotted Skipper and Dingy Skipper fluttering around the wildflowers in the warmer months. Birdlife includes Stonechat, Skylark and Whitethroat with Kittiwakes, Fulmars and Peregrine Falcon to look out for on the cliffs. You can start the walk from the South Hill Barn car park at the Nature Reserve. From here follow footpaths south west past the golf course to the coastal path and the wonderful cliffs at Seaford Head. Here you can pick up a section of the long distance Vanguard Way and follow it east to Hope Bottom and Cuckmere Haven. There's some lovely views of the River Cuckmere and the famous Seven Sisters Cliffs on the other side. From here you follow a public footpath north west through the reserve to return to the car park.",
