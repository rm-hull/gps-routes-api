  "description": "This Nottinghamshire based village is located a few miles south of the city of Nottingham. For walkers there's Rushcliffe Country Park on the southern side of the village. The park includes wildflower meadows and waterside paths around the large lake. There's also cycle trails and lots of wildlife to see as well. The village also includes the Nottingham Transport Heritage Centre where there's heritage buses, a large miniature railway, a model railway display, cafe and a shop. To the west of the village there's the Fairham Brook Nature Reserve. The reserve includes pleasant trails with wildlife such as kingfishers to see. Near here there's also the lakes at the Attenborough Nature Reserve where you can also enjoy riverside trails along the Trent Valley Way. This walk from Ruddington takes you past the country park and through the surrounding fields to visit the neighbouring villages of Bunny and Bradmore. On the way there's nice views of the surrounding moors and countryside.",
