  "description": "This circular walk in County Wicklow explores the Devil's Glen Woodland Park. The woods have some good walking trails running along the River Vartry to a picturesque waterfall. It's something of a hidden gem with peaceful trails, wildflowers and lots of wildlife to look out for. There's a car park at the eastern end where you can pick up the trail. It runs for just under 5km along a reasonably easy path with some small climbs on the way. The forest also includes the Seamus Heaney Walk. Some of the Nobel Prize winning poet's work was inspired by the evocative landscape of the glen. To continue your walking in the area head north to Vartry Reservoir where there are some fine waterside trails and views to Djouce Mountain and Sugarloaf in the Wicklow Mountains.",
