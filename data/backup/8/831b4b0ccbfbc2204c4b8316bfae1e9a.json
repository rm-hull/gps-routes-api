The cilycwm.com website gives this information: Llyn Brianne reservoir was originally built (1968-1972) to satisfy the growing demands of heavy industry in and around Swansea for water, notably the tin plate works at Felindre and a smelting plant at Llansamlet. Ironically, both these have since closed down and water from Llyn Brianne which is surplus to the Swansea area's needs now goes into the general supply, quenching thirsts all the way from Llanelli, across West and South Wales and as far East as Cardiff."

  "description": "This walk explores the Tywi Valley and forest in the Cambrian Mountains. The route runs from Llyn Brianne to Dolgoch, passing along the River Towy with waterfalls and wonderful mountainous scenery to enjoy. The walk starts from the car park at the northern end of Llyn Brianne but there is also a car park at Dolgoch if you would like to start from there. Follow trails north from the lake and they will take you along river as it feeds into the lake. You'll pass along the edge of the Tywi Forest where you can enjoy some peaceful woodland trails to the east of the river. The forest is a good place for wildlife with plenty of birds and the popular red squirrels to look out for.",
