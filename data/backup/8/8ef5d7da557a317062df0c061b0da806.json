  "description": "Climb to the summit of Holyhead Mountain on this walk on Holy Island, Anglesey. From the 722 feet (220 m) summit there are magnificent views towards the Isle of Man, the Skerries and the mountains of Ireland. The walk starts from the car park at the lovely Breakwater Country Park. The park covers 100 acres and includes a nature trail, a large pond and a visitor centre. You then follow the coast path to North Stack before ascending the mountain. The mountain is historically significant with a late Roman watchtower at the summit and an Iron Age stone circle settlement near its foot. The area is wonderful for wildlife watching with puffins, stonechats and oyster catchers to look out for. You may also see grey seals in the summer months. If you would like to extent your walk you could continue along the coast to South Stack Lighthouse. Here you can descend the 400 steps to the island and enjoy fabulous views on the way. The area also includes the South Stack RSPB nature reserve where you can look out for puffins and porpoises.",

There's hot or cold meals and a nice outdoor seating area with views of the park. You can find the cafe just to the south of the lake, near the entrance to the park."

      "content": "Near to the South Stack car park at the foot of the south western side of the mountain you will find the interesting Ty Mawr Hut Circles. Also known as Cytiau'r Gwyddelod or the Irishmen's Huts, they are the remains of a group of prehistoric huts and one of the best-preserved hut groups in Wales. The settlement is to the southeast of the South Stack Lighthouse, on the opposite side of the road from the small car park provided by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It's well worth a visit if you have time after your climb."
