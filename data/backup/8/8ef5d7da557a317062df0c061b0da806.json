  "description": "Climb to the summit of\u00a0Holyhead Mountain on this walk on Holy Island, Anglesey. From the 722 feet (220\u00a0m) summit there are magnificent views towards the Isle of Man, the Skerries and the mountains of Ireland. The walk starts from the car park at the lovely Breakwater Country Park . The park covers 100 acres and includes a nature trail, a large pond and a visitor centre. You then follow the coast path to North Stack before ascending the mountain. The mountain is historically significant with a late\u00a0Roman\u00a0watchtower at the summit and an Iron Age\u00a0stone circle\u00a0settlement near its foot. The area is wonderful for wildlife watching with puffins,\u00a0stonechats and oyster catchers to look out for. You may also see grey seals in the summer months. If you would like to extent your walk you could continue along the coast to South Stack Lighthouse . Here you can descend the 400 steps to the island and enjoy fabulous views on the way. The area also includes the South Stack RSPB nature reserve where you can look out for puffins and porpoises.",
