  "description": "This pretty little fishing village on the Yorkshire coast is a fine place to visit and start a walk.\u00a0A large part of the western side of the village, in what is known as The Valley is one of the most expensive areas to buy property on the Yorkshire Coast. This circular walk from the village takes you along the coast to the beautiful Runswick Bay before heading through the countryside to visit Mulgrave Woods . The walk starts in the village and heads north along the coast to Sandsend Ness  on the Cleveland Way . This\u00a0old\u00a0alum\u00a0quarrying site includes interesting geology and a large numbers of fossils. The walk continues north west along the waymarked trail to Kettleness. Shortly after you arrive at Runswick Bay, one of the highlights on the Yorkshire Coast. The picturesque village includes a sandy beach,\u00a0sheltered bay and a number of pretty little cottages.\nAlso of note is the white thatched property on the seafront which is the only remaining thatched house on the Yorkshire coast. The route then heads back to Kettleness where you turn inlcand to follow some lovely country lanes south past Goldsborough to East Barnby. Near here you enter Mulgrave Woods where there are some peaceful woodland trails, the ruins of Mulgrave Castle and pretty waterfalls to see. At the eastern end of the woods you emerge back on the coast at Sansdend.",
