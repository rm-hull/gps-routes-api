  "description": "This short walk in Torquay takes you through the Royal Terrace Gardens or Rock Walk. The Mediterranean style gardens are in an elevated spot above the town so there's splendid views across the bay to Berry Head. It's just under half a mile from end to end so roughly a mile there and back. The paths are well surfaced with some steps along the way as well.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area pick up the coast path on the Torquay to Brixham Walk. On the northern side of the town you could visit the lovely Brunel Woods. The site is named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel who loved the area and intended to set up home at Watcombe Park before he died. To the west of Torbay there's the historic Berry Pomeroy Castle to explore. Here you'll find the ruins of a 15th century castle surrounded by pleasant woodland trails. The site is run by English Heritage so there's good facilities with a car park, gift shop and cafe. The John Musgrave Heritage Trail can be picked up in this area too. The waymarked trail runs from Maidencombe to Brixham, visiting several of South Devon's interesting historical sites on the way."
