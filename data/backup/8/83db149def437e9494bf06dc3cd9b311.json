  "description": "This Staffordshire based market town has some fine riverside and canalside walks to try. The historic brewing settlement is dotted with pleasant local parks and pockets of woodland right in the centre of town. This circular walk explores Stapenhill Gardens, the Stapenhill Viaduct, the River Trent and the Trent Washlands area in the town. The walk starts in the pretty Stapenhill Gardens where there are some nice trails around the gorgeous flower beds. The park also includes wild flower meadows and a large cement-rendered sculpture of a swan that has been described as a \"Burton landmark\". There is a nice video below which showcases the gardens. After exploring the gardens you can then cross the river on the 19th century Ferry Bridge and explore the riverside gardens and woodland on the opposite side. This area is known as the Washlands and includes a sculpture trail with some impressive pieces. You can continue along the Stapenhill Viaduct and then visit The Abbey Trail by Peel's Cut. Around here you will pass Burton's busy market and the Church of St Modwen. You then return on more riverside paths to Stapenhill where the walk finishes. Much of this route takes place on a designated cycle path so also makes for a nice easy cycle in the town centre.",
