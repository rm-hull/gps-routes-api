  "description": "A nice easy walk along Peakshole Water from Hope to Castleton in the Peak District. The pretty stream flows through the village of Castleton to join the River Noe in nearby Hope. You can follow a nice footpath along the water, running for nearly two miles. It's a fairly flat route with the option of climbing up to Peveril Castle in Castleton. The ruined 11th-century castle was founded some time between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and its first recorded mention in the Domesday Survey of 1086. From its elevated position you can enjoy great views over the Hope Valley. To extend your walking in the areatry our longer Hope Valley Walk or the popular Castleton Circular Walk .",
