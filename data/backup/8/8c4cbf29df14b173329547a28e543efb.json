  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir\u00a0on Ruislip Common. The lake is a popular spot in the summer with its artificial beach and super Mini gauge railway. There's also nice walking trails around the water and through the adjacent woodland. There are two\u00a0car parks on site or you can catch the tube to Ruislip tube station.\u00a0 Please see the link below for additional parking and public transport details. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the lake side cafe and visit the Woodland Centre where you can learn about the history of the area. It's easy to extend your walk by heading into Bayhurst Wood Country Park and Ruislip Woods . You can follow the Hillingdon Trail west through Mad Bess Woods. If you follow the trail south you will soon come to Ickenham where you can enjoy another waterside walk along the Yeading Brook . For cyclists London Cycle Network Route 89 passes through Ruislip just to the south of the lake. You can follow the route from Uxbridge and West Drayton.",
