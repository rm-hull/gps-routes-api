  "description": "This circular walk takes you along the River Thames around the village of Shiplake. The village has a train station near the river making it a nice place for an easy riverside walk for anyone using public transport. The walk starts from the train station where you can pick up the Thames Path and follow it south to Shiplake Lock on the River Thames. You can then follow the towing path around to Lashbrook before returning to the train station. This section of the river gives nice views over to Wargrave on the opposite side.",

On the opposite side of the river there's the neighbouring village of Wargrave. It's well worth a visit with a historic high street with many old listed buildings, a picturesque marina, a 12th century church and a very fine riverside pub where you can relax with a view of the river. You can also pick up the Knowl Hill Bridleway near here. The circular cycling and walking route explores the area around Knowl Hill, with some fine views from the high points."
