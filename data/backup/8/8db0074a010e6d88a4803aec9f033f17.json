  "description": "Newbridge is located in the county borough of Caerphilly, near Crumlin and Abercarn. For walkers there are wide areas of forestry to the east and riverside trails along the Ebbw River which flows through the town. This walk takes you along a section of the Ebbw Valley Walk to visit one of the area highlights at Sirhowy Valley Country Park. The walk starts on the river in the town centre where there is an attractive new footbridge and a pleasant riverside footpath. Head west and you can enjoy a stroll through Caetwmpyn Park where there are some nice views over the surrounding hills and countryside. You can pick up the waymarked Ebbw Valley Walk just west of the park and follow it south through woodland towards Abercarn, Crosskeys and Risca. Here you will enter the Sirhowy Valley Country Park where you can enjoy riverside trails along the Sirhowy River and a climb to a fine viewpoint in Graig Goch Woods. The trails along the river here are also suitable for cyclists. The walk could be extended by climbing Machen Mountain which lies just to the south east of the park. In Crosskeys you can also pick up the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and enjoy a stroll along the towpath.",
