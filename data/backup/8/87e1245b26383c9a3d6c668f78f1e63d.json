  "description": "This walk takes you to the impressive Leaderfoot Viaduct in Melrose on the Scottish Borders. The disused railway viaduct crosses the River Tweed a few miles east of the town. Start the walk from Melrose Abbey and head north to the River. You can then pick up a nice riverside path heading east to the structure. Here you'll also find the Drygrange Old Bridge, a road bridge dating from 1776, and its modern successor sitting just to the east of the viaduct. To the south you will find the fascinating Roman settlement of Trimontium where there are great views back to the viaduct. Cross the river on the new bridge an you can enjoy more fine views down the Tweed. To continue your walking in Melrose head up to the Eildon Hills. There's fabulous views over the Scottish Borders, Melrose Abbey and Leaderfoot Viaduct from here.",
