When in full operation there was a half-hourly service and as many as 3,650 passengers were carried each day. In 1944 extensive sidings were built and used to store locomotives and rolling stock. After D-day, when the allied bridgehead in France was completed, these were delivered to France via Liss and Portsmouth."

  "description": "This circular walk around the Hampshire village of Liss, uses waymarked trails to explore the surrounding countryside and woodland. On the route you will visit the hamlet of Liss Forest, the Riverside Railway Walk and the villages of Rake and Hill Brow. There's also some nice views over the South Downs as you make your way along Rake Hangar. The walk starts from Liss train station where you can pick up the Liss Riverside Railway Walk which is a waymarked trail running through a nature reserve. The path runs north from the station along the line of the old Longmoor Military Railway. There's views of the River Rother and the River Blackwater and lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for on the trail. At Liss Forest you pick up a section of the Shipwrights Way and follow it east towards the village of Rake. Near here you join with the Sussex Border Path and the Serpent Trail which lead you south west along Rake Hangar toward Hill Brow. You then head west across Farther Commons before following country lanes and bridle paths back to Liss train station.",
