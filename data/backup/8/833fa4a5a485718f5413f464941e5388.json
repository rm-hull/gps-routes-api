  "description": "This walk visits the photogenic Smoo Cave in Durness, Sutherland, Highland. The cave is in a wonderful coastal location and includes a number of walkways you can follow around the imposing cave entrance. Other paths then head off to the north so you can explore the coast and enjoy some wonderful sea views. You can even head inside and explore the murky cave at low tide. Boats tours can take you deeper inside the cave system along the Allt Smoo stream. The site also has good facilities with a car park, toilets and stairs. Just to the west of the cave there's the John Lennon Memorial Garden to see. From the age of nine famous Lennon shared his holidays with his cousins at Sangomore in Durness. Amongst the attractive flora are lyrics from popular Beetles songs and seating with extensive views of the surrounding mountains. It's a nice additional place to visit in the area if you have time.",
