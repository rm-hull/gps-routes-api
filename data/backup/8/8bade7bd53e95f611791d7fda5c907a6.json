  "description": "Climb to the 856 feet (261 m) summit of Holmbury Hill on this circular walk in the Surrey Hills. The hill is the fourth highest point in the county and commands wonderful views over the surrounding area. The walk starts in the village of Holmbury St Mary, next to the church. You then pick up the Greensand Way and follow it through Hurt Wood to the hill summit where you will find an Iron Age hillfort and great views over the Weald of Sussex. You descend on more good woodland trails, returning you to the village. The area is also good for mountain bikers with a number of bridleways through Hurt Wood to try. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head east and climb the nearby Leith Hill, the highest point on the Greensand Ridge. Around here you'll also find the expansive Abinger Common and Holmwood Common with miles of good trails to try. If you head west you can climb Pitch Hill and explore the expansive Hurt Wood and Winterfold Forest .",
