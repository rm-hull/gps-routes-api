  "description": "This walk climbs Slieve League (Sliabh Liag) Mountain on the spectacular Atlantic coast of County Donegal. The walk starts from the car park at the Slieve League viewing platform. You can then follow a wonderful path north heading along some of the highest sea cliffs in Europe. The path is quite rocky and challenging so a good pair of hiking boots is recommended. On the way you will pass One Man's Pass which will take you to the 609m (1,998 ft) summit of the mountain. From here there are some truly breathtaking views over the sea. Historically, the area is associated with pilgrimages with the remains of an early Christian monastic site to see on the walk.",
