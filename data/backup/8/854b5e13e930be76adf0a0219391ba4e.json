  "description": "This pretty reservoir in Banbury has a nice circular footpath to follow around the perimeter. At the northern end there's also the Grimsbury Woodland nature reserve where there's some nice woodland trails and wildlife to see. The site is a popular fishing spot and also home to the Banbury Cross Sailing club. You can extend your walk in Spiceball Country Park which lies just to the south of the site. There's some more waterside walking along the Oxford Canal here.",
