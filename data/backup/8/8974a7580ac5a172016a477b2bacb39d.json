  "description": "This Powys based village sits in a lovely canalside location with walkers able to enjoy the scenery of the Usk Valley and Brecon Beacons National Park. This route uses sections of the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and the Taff Trail to create a circular walk from the village. There's nice easy paths along the towpath before following country lanes to the neighbouring village of Llanfrynach. On the route there are fine views of the Cefn Brynich Aqueduct, the River Usk and the Brecon Beacons in the distance. To extend the walk head north into the town of Brecon where you can visit the canal basin. Heading south will take you to the worthy village of Talybont On Usk with more details on the Brecon to Talybont Canal Walk page. The popular climb to the wonderful viewpoint at Pen Y Fan is also nearby.",
