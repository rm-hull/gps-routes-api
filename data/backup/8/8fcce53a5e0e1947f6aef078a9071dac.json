  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Kennet and Avon Canal from Bradford on Avon to Devizes. The route is just over 12 miles so it's perfect for a day's walk. You'll pass along the flat towpath and visit the noteworthy Caen Hill Locks as you approach Devizes. Along the way there's a series of pretty locks and lots of barges to see. Starting in Bradford on Avon you head east, passing Trowbridge and Hilperton before coming to Semington. You continue past Seend Cleeve and Martinslade before coming to Caen Hill Locks. The 29 continuos locks have a rise of 237 feet in 2 miles (72 m in 3.2 km). It's an impressive sight with views of some lovely Wiltshire woodland and countryside to see in the area surrounding the locks. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for with Kingfishers, Moorhens, Ducks and Swans to see on the water. Shortly after passing the locks you come into Devizes. Here you can pick up the long distance Wessex Ridgeway and follow it north along Quaker's Walk to Roundway Hill. The hill is the site of a famous Civil War battle where a Royalist cavalry force under Lord Wilmot won a crushing victory over the Parliamentarians in 1643. To continue your walking in the Bradford on Avon area try our Bradford on Avon Canal and River Walk .",
