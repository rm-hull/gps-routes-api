The white object, at top right, is the moon. The area has been a tourist destination since Victorian times when the railway between Dublin and Belfast was opened. Situated approximately halfway between the two cities, the access to the area combined with its scenery and sheltered location are still factors in its popularity today."

  "description": "This walk in County Louth visits Carlingford lough before a climb to the viewpoint at Slieve Foye. You can start the walk in the town of Carlingford on the shores of the lake. From here you can follow tracks heading north west and then south to reach the 589 metre summit of Slieve Foye. At the summit you can enjoy some wonderful views over the lake to the surrounding hills and mountains. The walk then continues south to Barnavave before descending back to the town and the lake. The area is great for wildlife watching with pale-bellied brent goose\u00a0to look out for around the saltmarsh and terns to see around the shingle islands. Carlingford is notable as one of only 3 glacial\u00a0fjords\u00a0in Ireland with the others being Lough Swilly\u00a0and Killary Fjord .",
