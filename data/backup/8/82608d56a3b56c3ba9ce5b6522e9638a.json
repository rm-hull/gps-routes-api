  "description": "This varied walk between Rye and Hastings includes a nature reserve, a canal-side path, exhilirating cliff top trails, beautiful bays and lovely beaches. It follows a section of the Saxon Shore Way long distance trail so there are good waymarked footpaths for the duration of the walk. Starting in Rye you head south through the beautiful Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. The reserve is a great place for wildlife spotting and includes saltmarsh, lagoons, grazing marsh, shingle and reedbeds. The path will lead you to the small town of Winchelsea where you pick up the Royal Military Canal Path . Constructed in the early 19th century as a defence against a possible invasion by Napoleon, the canal-side path now makes for a nice easy walk. It will lead you all the way to Pet Level where you pick up the coast path to Fairlight Cove . Here you'll find a lovely beach surrounded by cliffs. The path continues west past the pretty Covehurst Bay before coming to Hastings Country Park . The site includes 600 acres of beautiful parkland with more great wildlife spotting opportunities. Peregrines, black redstarts and fulmars can be seen on the coastal cliffs, while Dartford warblers, stonechats and yellowhammers can be seen on the gorse covered hills. The final section takes you from the park to High Wickham before finishing in Hastings by the pier. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the long distance 1066 Country Walk which follows in the steps of William the Conqueror, taking you to Battle Abbey at the site of the Battle of Hastings.",
