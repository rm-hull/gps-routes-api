  "description": "This circular walk takes you up to the summit of Hawnby Hill from the village of Hawnby in Ryedale area of the North York Moors. The hill is located about a mile to the north of the settlement and can be reached by following a grassy footpath from close to the village centre. It will take you past Crooked Hill Wood to the limestone hill crag which stands at a height of 298 metres. From the top there are some excellent views over the surrounding moorland and hills. You can then descend back to the village on an alternative path via Hill End House. The area is one of the less visited places in the national park so it should be quite a peaceful walk. The village itself is also very quiet with a few stone cottages and a 12th century church by the River Rye.",
