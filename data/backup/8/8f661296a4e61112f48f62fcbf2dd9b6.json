Beyond is the dome of the Royal Devonshire Hospital, originally the stable block for the hotels and now part of the University of Derby."

  "description": "The popular spa town of Buxton has a number of waymarked trails taking you though this beautiful area of the Peak District. There's also challenging hill climbs, riverside paths, pretty reservoirs and delightful parks to explore. This walk from the town visits a series of beautiful valleys along the River Wye. You'll pass through Wye Dale, Chee Dale, and the popular Miller's Dale before finishing at Cressbrook Dale. It's about a 10 mile walk so 20 miles there and back. You can shorten it by going as far as Miller's Dale which is one of the highlights of the area. Here you have the option of heading north from the river and visiting Tideswell Dale and the village of Tideswell. It's a fantastic area for walking with the rushing waters of the river, shady woodland and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Please note it's downhill on the way there so save some energy for the way back! You could turn it into a circular walk by heading north at Monk's Dale and returning through the countryside via Tunstead. The walk uses some of the excellent long distance trails you can pick up near the town. This includes the Midshires Way, Pennine Bridleway and Monsal Trail .",
