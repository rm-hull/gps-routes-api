  "description": "This walk takes you from Exford to nearby Winsford using a section of the Samaritans Way South West long distance trail. The trail runs along the River Exe with some nice countryside and woodland trails on the way. The walk starts in Exford where you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it south east to Lyncombe Wood. The trail continues along the river to West Nethercote before passing Bye Common and Bye Hill. This area marks the high point of the walk, rising to a height of over 1100 feet. There's some lovely views over Exmoor and Exe Valley from this elevated position. The final stage descends Bye Hill to take you into Winsford. It's a pretty village with a ford, weir, thatched cottages, an old bridge and refreshment options.",
