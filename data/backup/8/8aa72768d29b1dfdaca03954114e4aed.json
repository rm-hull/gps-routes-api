  "description": "This walk takes you from Exford to nearby Winsford using a section of the Samaritans Way South West long distance trail. The trail runs along the River Exe with some nice countryside and woodland trails on the way. The walk starts in Exford where you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it south east to Lyncombe Wood. The trail continues along the river to West Nethercote before passing Bye Common and Bye Hill. This area marks the high point of the walk, rising to a height of over 1100 feet. There's some lovely views over Exmoor and Exe Valley from this elevated position. The final stage descends Bye Hill to take you into Winsford. It's a pretty village with a ford, weir, thatched cottages, an old bridge and refreshment options.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area head south west to Withypool to visit the Tarr Steps. You can reach the steps on the Withypool to Tarr Steps Circular Walk which uses a section of the waymarked Two Moors Way. The popular site includes a wondeful clapper bridge which is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument, dating from the medieval period. The popular Whitegate Way starts/finishes in Winsford. The shared cycling and walking trail follows a disused railway line north to Cuddington. A car park and the old station can be found at the Winsford end. To the west is the village of Simonsbath, a popular starting point for a number of walks on Exmoor. Our circular walk visits the River Barle and the source of the River Exe at Exe Head. Near here there's also Pinkery Pond, a remote beauty spot with a picturesque pond popular with wild swimmers. You'll also find the 487m high Chains Barrow Hill in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Exmoor Walks page."
