This route is now a bridleway followed by the Taff Trail. Other stone was sourced from quarries between Pant and Pontsticill down the valley. With a water level of 1506ft, this reservoir is the highest in Fforest Fawr Geopark and indeed in Brecon Beacons National Park. The Upper Reservoir has a capacity of 340 million gallons and the dam, seen here on the right, is 75ft high. The ridge in the background is Tor Glas reaching over 600m in height. A snow storm was on its way, indicated by the ominous black clouds."

  "description": "These two pretty reservoirs are located on the edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park near to the town of Merthyr Tydfil. It's a remote spot and a lovely place for a peaceful walk in stunning surroundings. The walk starts from the Neuadd car park at Taf Fechan Forest, just south of the reservoirs. From here you can follow country lanes and other tracks up to the water. You can then follow trails along the eastern side of the reservoirs with Tor Glas towering above you on your right. It's a beautiful place with fine views across the water to the other surrounding hills and mountains.",
