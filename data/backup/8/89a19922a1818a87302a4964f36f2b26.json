      "caption": "Duckboards over the River Ravensbourne in Padmall Wood. These woods are located between Keston and Hayes Common. Padmall Wood is a semi-natural ancient woodland and Local Nature Reserve (LNR), located along the banks of the River Ravensbourne, just north of Ravensbourne Open Space. This woodland has a long history, with its sweet chestnut trees having been planted in the 19th century. Historically, the chestnut was harvested every 15 to 20 years, primarily for the production of hop poles and heavy hurdles, though today, it's used mainly for post and rail fencing. The wood also contains birch trees, traditionally utilised for making broom handles and cotton reels, and hazel, a versatile wood historically important in the construction of wattle and daub house walls. Hazel continues to be used for wicker hurdles, hedging, and bean poles. The diversity of tree species in Padmall Wood reflects its long-standing use and the traditional woodland management practices that have shaped it over the centuries."
