  "description": "Golitha Falls National Nature Reserve has woodland walking trails taking you through a steep-sided valley gorge. The River Fowey runs through the gorge with a series of spectacular cascades known as Golitha Falls. The reserve is excellent for interesting flora and fauna with diverse plantlife including bluebells, wildflowers, cow-wheat, bilberry and wavy-hair grass. Look out for wildlife including butterflies, bats and birds such as dipper, nuthatch, treecreeper and buzzard. There is a good size car park at Draynes Bridge from which this walk begins. Golitha Falls is located just a few miles north of Liskeard. If you would like to extend your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Siblyback Lake where you will find a lovely waterside footpath.",
