  "description": "This Renfrewshire village is in an ideal spot for easy waterside walks along the local lochs, meadows and wildlife rich nature reserves. This walk visits the RSPB's Lochwinnoch Nature Reserve on the southern side of the loch. You can start the walk from the reserve car park or from Lochwinnoch train station which lies right next to the reserve. Footpaths can then be followed through Aird Meadow to the waterside. The reserve is a great place for birdwatching with whooper swans and the great crested grebes highlights. You can extend the walk by heading south from the car park to visit Barr Loch. On the northern side of the water there's also the splendid Castle Semple Country Park to explore.",

Just south of Largs you can pick up the popular Fairlie Glen Circular Walk. It's a delightful route with babbling streams, woodland trails, open glens, photogenic waterfalls and fine coastal views."
