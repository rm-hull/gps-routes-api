  "description": "This large Buckinghamishire town is a great place to go for a country walk with some several attractive woodland areas, views of the Chiltern Hills and the wonderful Hughenden Park to enjoy. With a train station on the\u00a0Chiltern Main Line, the town is easily accessible from London with services operated by\u00a0Chiltern Railways\u00a0from\u00a0London Marylebone. As such it's a great place to come for a country weekend walk if you coming from the capital. This circular walk visits some of the highlights of the area including Hughenden Park , Naphill Common, Downley Common and Little Tinker's Wood. The walk starts just to the north of the town centre where you can pick up footpaths heading north to Hughenden Manor and Park. It's a short distance from the town centre and well worth exploring. On the site you will find 1,500 acres of parkland with woodland trails, pretty formal gardens and riverside paths to enjoy. After exploring the park the route follows more footpaths north west through Flagmore Wood and then up to Naphill Common. Here you will find 55 acres (63 hectares) of woodland, paths, bridleways, ponds, heathland and open glades.\u00a0You can also look out for a variety of wildlife including deer and a number of woodland birds. After exploring Naphill the route turns south to visit the adjacent Downley Common. There's more nice trails, here with lots of pretty wildflowers and bluebells in the spring. The final section of the route takes you through Little Tinker's Wood before returning to High Wycombe. To extend the walk you could head south west from Naphill to visit West Wycombe Park . Here you will find West Wycombe House which includes 45 acres of landscaped gardens with a lovely large lake, views of the River Wyre, woodland paths and sweeping lawns to enjoy. Also nearby is the National Trust's Bradenham Woods . The walk here includes lovely Chiltern views and a visit to the delightful village of Bradenham. The woods can be easily visited from Saunderton which has a train station. To the west of the village you can pick up The Ridgeway and the Chiltern Way to further explore the Chilterns AONB . The Chiltern Way Berkshire Loop long distance trail also starts in the town. The trail heads to Crowsley Park, near Henley on Thames, with nice riverside stretches along the river to enjoy.",
