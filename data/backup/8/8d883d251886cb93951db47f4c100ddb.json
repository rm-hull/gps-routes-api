Although there is no historical evidence of a 'Saints' Way', sections of the trail are known ancient routes connecting shrines, standing stones, holy wells, chapels and churches. Linked together, the trail forms a fairly direct cross-county path which may have been used by Christian missionaries and pilgrims in the Dark and Middle Ages. The Saints' Way was also known as the Mariners' Way and used by traders from Ireland and Wales who wanted to avoid the dangerous waters around Lands End. Granite steps are provided but not needed if the gate is kept open."

  "description": "This walk takes you across Cornwall from Padstow in the north to Fowey on the south coast. It follows the probable route of early Christian travellers making their way from Ireland to the Continent. The route begins by the delightful Padstow Harbour and heads south through Little Petherick, St Breck Downs and Lanivet before joining the Fowey River near Lostwithiel for a lovely waterside stretch that leads to Fowey. This final section passes the noteworthy Sawmills Studios, a recording studio used most notably by musicians such as The Stone Roses (Fools Gold) and The Verve (A Storm in Heaven), Muse, Oasis (Definitely Maybe), Catatonia, Ride, Swans and Supergrass. The main building is a 17th-century water mill and the site has a documented history stretching back to the 11th century. See the Fowey to Golant Walk for more details.",
