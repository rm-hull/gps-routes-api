The big glacier in the main valley (The Tay) created a deep trough and after the ice melted at the end of the Ice Age the rivers tumbled down the tributary valleys to form gorges. This is a very beautiful, and easily accessible place. The circular walk has recently been renovated - it takes around 1.5 hours and is an easy walk."

  "description": "Enjoy a series of beautiful waterfalls and peaceful woodland paths on this lovely walk in Aberfeldy, Perthshire. The walk starts in the car park in Aberfeldy and follows a good footpath along the Moness burn to the Falls of Moness. It's a lovely area with a shaded gorge, the rushing sound of the waterfalls, pretty little wooden bridges over the burn and a variety of birdlife to look out for and listen to. You'll also pass Burns' Seat where Robert Burns is said to have been inspired to write the poem 'The Birks of Aberfeldy' in the late 18th century. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Aberfeldy to Kenmore Riverside Walk. This will take you west along the River Tay to Kenmore where the river enters the stunning Loch Tay .",
