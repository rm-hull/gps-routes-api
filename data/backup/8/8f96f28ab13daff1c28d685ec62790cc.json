  "description": "These woods near the town of Amersham have some good footpaths and mountain bike trails to try. You can start off at the car park on Bottrells Lane at the northern edge of the site. From here you can pick up miles of footpaths and bridleways across the 250-acre woods. It's a delightful area with lots of pretty bluebells in the spring and a healthy population of Muntjac Deer to look out for. Also keep your eyes peeled for tawny owls, buzzards, kites and numerous other woodland birds. This basic circular route is designed for walkers but cyclists can also enjoy a series of permissive trails and a bike park with bumps and jumps. See the video below for an idea of what you can expect from the ride. Click here for a map showing the trails and visit the website below to get a permit for cycling in the woods. Our Amersham Circular Walk skirts the northern edge of the woods. You can pick it up to extend your walk and explore the countryside surrounding Amersham and the nearby village of Chalfont St Giles. The long distance South Bucks Way also passes just to the north of the woods. It's a great way to explore the Misbourne valley area of the Chilterns and extend your exercise. You can also visit the woods on foot from the nearby town of Beaconsfield. Our Beaconsfield Circular Walk starts from the train station in the town and follows public footpaths to the site.",
