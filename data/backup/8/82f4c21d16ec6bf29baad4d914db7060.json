  "description": "This walk follows the East Devon Way along the Exe Estuary and then through the East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to finish at Uplyme near the Dorset/Devon border. The walk takes you across a variety of landscapes including heathland, woodland and valleys and also includes some lovely riverside stretches. You start in Exmouth and follow the Exe Estuary to Lympstone where you turn east towards Harpford, crossing the East Devon Commons and the RSPB Aylesbeare Nature Reserve as you go. You'll pass the lovely Woodbury Common where you'll find heathland, gorse, heather and pebblebeds from rivers which once flowed across the basin. There's also the ancient hill fort of Woodbury Castle where there are great views of the Exe estuary, Haldon Hills, Otter Valley, and Portland Bill on the coast. The route continues through Harpford Woods and Harpford Common before a stretch through the Beacon Hill Nature Reserve takes you to the village of Sidbury and then onto Northleigh. Shortly after you join a pleasant riverside stretch along the River Coly taking you into Colyton. Another waterside section along the River Axe takes you to Musberry Hill where there are splendid views of the Axe Valley. The final leg then takes you from Musbury Hill to Uplyme where you finish by the River Lym.",
