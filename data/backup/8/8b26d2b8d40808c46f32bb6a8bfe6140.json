  "description": "This Cumbrian port town is located in a lovely spot on the Solway Firth, close to the Lake District hills. It's a fine place for a stroll with an attractive village green and a lovely promenade by the scenic harbour. This coastal circular walk visits Gurne Point and Skinburness to the north of the town. The route makes use of the Allerdale Ramble and the Cumbria Coastal Way which run through the area. The route starts from the public car park on the sea front in Silloth. From here you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it north along the beach to the Cote Lighthouse and Skinburness before coming to Gurne Point. You then head around the Point before picking up a trail along Skinburness Creek. This will take you back to the coast path before following an inland trail through Silloth town centre towards the docks. From here it is a short stroll back to the beach and the car park. The Solway Coast Walk starts in the town and runs to Bowness-on-Solway providing an opportunity for extending your walking from the town.",
