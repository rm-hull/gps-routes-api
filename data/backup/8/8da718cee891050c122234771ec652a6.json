      "caption": "Carrick Bridge, Carrick-on-Shannon, Co. Leitrim. Until the early 19th century, Drumsna was the head of the Shannon Navigation, serving as a key point for river trade. Significant improvements in the 1840s, including extensive dredging, the construction of the Jamestown Canal, and the building of locks at Drumsna and Knockvicar, transformed the navigation system. These developments were essential in enhancing the navigability of the Shannon River. A new bridge, constructed in 1846, replaced an earlier nine-arch stone bridge, which itself had succeeded a wooden structure. This new infrastructure played a crucial role in Carrick-on-Shannon's growth as a major depot for river trade. For over a century, the town was a significant hub, with goods such as timber, cement, hardware, and notably Guinness stout being transported from Dublin, Athlone, and Limerick. The river trade continued to thrive until the closure of the Grand Canal Company in 1960, marking the end of an era for Carrick-on-Shannon as a key commercial depot on the Shannon River."
