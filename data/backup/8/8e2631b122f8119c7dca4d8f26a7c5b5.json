      "caption": "Bradgate Park The Charnwood Forest landscape of rugged hills emerging from areas of thick woodland is unlike anywhere else in Leicestershire and can be quite a surprise for anyone unfamiliar with the county. Bradgate Park, an ancient deer park covering 830 acres, contains some of the best of this landscape and has benefited from being kept largely in its original condition - although much of the park has now been overtaken by bracken which replaced gorse and heather. This path leads up to the Leicestershire Yeomanry memorial."

  "description": "This Leicestershire based village is in a great location for walkers wishing to explore the National Forest area of the county. There's riverside trails along the Soar, some fine local country parks and a series of picturesque reservoirs to explore on foot. This walk from the village takes you to some of the local walking highlights including Swithland Reservoir, Swithland Woods, Cropston Reservoir and Bradgate Country Park . The varied route makes use of sections of the Leicestershire Round and National Forest Way long distance footpaths. The walk starts at Mountsorrel Lock on the River Soar just east of the village. Near here you can pick up the Leicestershire Round and follow it west past the old Mountsorrel Quarries. The trail will take you along the top of Swithland Reservoir before heading south to Swithland Wood. There's lots of peaceful woodland trails with a variety of wildlife to see here. You continue south to another waterside trail along Cropston Reservoir before looping back to explore the popular Bradgate Country Park. There's resident deer and a fine viewpoint with views across the surrounding countryside. The route then heads north back through the woods to the neighbouring village of Woodhouse Eaves. Here you could take a detour or extension to visit another great viewpoint at Beacon Hill Country Park which lies just to the north west.
