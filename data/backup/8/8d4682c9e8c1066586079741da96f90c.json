  "description": "With its own train station and easy access to a number of walking trails, the village of Ashurst is a popular visitor attraction. This circular walk takes you through the woodland on the south eastern side of the village. Starting from the train station you head through Ashurst Wood, the Longdown Inclosure, the Deerlap Inclosure and the Churchplace Inclosure. Along the way you should see New Forest Ponies and cattle. You could extend the walk by continuing west onto Longwater Lawn where there are nice views of the Beaulieu River.",

      "content": "Head a few miles north west and you could pay a visit to Minstead. The unspoilt village includes a pretty village green, thatched cottages, a popular local pub and a historic 13th century church. The Minstead Walk visits the beautiful Furzey Gardens before heading to the Rufus Stone just to the north east of the gardens. This historical stone apparently marks the spot where King William II was fatally wounded with an arrow, during a royal hunting outing in the Forest, in the year 1100. It's another local highlight with some nice tranquil walking trails and a picnic area. The Acres Down Walk also starts near Minstead. It visits the lovely Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary and the pretty streams and woodland of the Highland Water Inclosure For more walking ideas in the area see the New Forest Walks page."
