It is one of the few houses built during the Commonwealth period. The gardens were neglected since the turn of the last century and were totally overgrown when restoration began in 1994. Whilst the house remains private, the gardens are open regularly on Sundays."

  "description": "Enjoy a stroll through Highnam Park and Highnam Court gardens on this short walk in Gloucester. Highlights include the 19th century Pulhamite winter garden with rock gardens, waterfalls, evergreens and ferns. There is also an orangery, a kitchen garden, a number of ornate statues and a formal flower garden. The footpaths are well laid out and include a great surfaced path alongside the lake with views to the 17th century grade I listed country house. Look out for a series of attractive wooden sculptures as you make your way through the park. The gardens are only open at selected times and for private visits by request. Please see the link below for more details. To extend your walking in the area you could enjoy a stroll around the village of Highnam with its attractive 19th century church of the Holy Innocents and village hall. You could also visit the nearby Highnam Woods. It is located just a mile to the west and has a 2km nature trail through ancient woodland.",
