  "description": "The town of Atherton is based in Greater Manchester, near Wigan and Bolton. This walk takes you around the Hulton Park Estate and New Park wood to the north of the town. Hulton Park is a landscape park dating from the early 19th century, and originally associated with Hulton Hall, which was demolished in 1958. Most of the land is now private property but a small section of New Park Wood is owned by Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council. Features in the park include peaceful woodland, lakes, ponds and views of the Mersey valley. You can also look out for wildlife such as woodland birds, deer and herons. On the walk you will pass the Pretoria pit monument. It marks the site of a mining disaster in the early 20th century. In this area you can look out for evidence of the old mine workings and the colliery railway as well. Other local walking highlights include the nearby Pennington Flash Country Park and Moses Gate Country Park. Both parks have some fine cycling and walking trails and are within easy reach of the town.",
