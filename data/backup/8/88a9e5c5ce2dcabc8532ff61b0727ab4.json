  "description": "This Buckinghamshire based market town has some nice country trails to try. There's interesting buildings in the town too with old thatched cottages, a 14th century church and an old hall dating from 1700. This circular walk from the town uses part of the Cross Bucks Way to visit the neighbouring villages of Swanbourne and Granborough. There's some attractive cottages and more historic buildings to see, inclulding a noteworthy 13th century church in Swanbourne. The route starts at Winslow Hall in the town centre. The hall dates from 1700 and is thought to have been designed by famous architect Sir Christopher Wren. From here you can pick up the Cross Bucks Way and follow the waymarked footpath east to Swanbourne where the trail links with the epic Midshires Way. Follow the trail south west and it will take you past the Holcombe Cottages to Granborough. The route then heads north west to Tuckey Cottage and Bridge Farm Cottages where you turn east to follow a footpath back into the town.",
