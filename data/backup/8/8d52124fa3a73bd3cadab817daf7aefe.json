  "description": "Enjoy some lovely waterside walking along these two reservoirs in the Goyt Valley area of the Peak District.  The walk starts from the Erwood Hall Car Park at the southern end of Erwood Reservoir but you could also start the walk at Buxton and follow the Midshires Way to the reservoirs. The route follows good footpaths along the western side of the two reservoirs before following the River Goyt to Fernilee. You can return the same way or follow the Midshires Way through the woodland above the reservoirs. It's a beautiful area with the water surrounded by attractive woodland and the river feeding into Fernilee Reservoir at the northern end. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could explore the Errwood Estate with its old ruined hall and peaceful woodland with azaleas and rhododendrons. The Shining Tor and Cats Tor Walk starts from the same location so you could climb these hills to extend your walking. They offer wonderful views of the Cheshire Plain,  Winter Hill, the city of Manchester and Jodrell Bank .",
