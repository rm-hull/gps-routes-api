  "description": "This super country park in West Bromwich is perfect for a short cycle or walk. In the park you will find a fully restored working Victorian farm with grazing meadows, walled kitchen gardens, Grade II listed buildings, a small museum and tea rooms.  The park is also a RSPB nature reserve with several small lakes and bird hides. For cyclists there is an excellent mountain bike trail and National Cycle Network route number 5 runs through the park.  There are also several lovely walking trails taking you along the lakes and the River Thame to the nature centre.  With 660 acres to explore there is plenty to keep you busy for the day but if you'd like to continue your walk the Beacon Way walking route runs through the park.",
