  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll around the beautiful grounds and gardens of this Grade I listed building in Ravenglass. There are 77 acres of beautiful gardens to explore and over 6 miles of walking paths through the estate. Visit the bluebell wood, the wildflower meadow, the Japanese garden, the Himalayan garden and the pretty Dragonfly pond. From the castle there's also wonderful views towards the Lake District mountains. The castle sits just below Muncaster Fell which is a great place to extend your walk. Our circular walk starts from castle car park where you can pick up trails to take you up on to the fell. It's a great ridge walk with fine views to the coast and Eskdale. You could also pick up the Cumbria Coastal Way which runs through Ravenglass. It's a beautiful area located on the estuaries of three rivers - the Esk, Mite and Irt. The Drigg, Dunes and Irt Estuary Nature Reserve is also a great place for bird watching.",

      "content": "A few miles to the south east you'll find the mysterious Swinside Stone Circle. It's a beautiful, remote spot with the Lake District mountains making a fine backdrop to these photogenic ancient stones. Also of interest is the Ravenglass Circular Beach Walk which visits the Drigg Beach Nature Reserve from the village. Here you'll find sand dunes, an abundance of interesting plantlife and lots of wildlife, with several species of wading birds to look out for on the river estuary. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cumbria Walks and the Lake District Walks pages."
