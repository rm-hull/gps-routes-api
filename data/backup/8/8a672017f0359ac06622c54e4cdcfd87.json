  "description": "Enjoy a stroll around the grounds of this medieval castle in the town of Ruthin, North Wales. There's parkland, woodland and beautiful gardens with lots of wildlife to see. Look out for the resident peacocks, rabbits, butterflies and various birds. The castle dates from the 13th century with some of the ruined walls now forming part of the Ruthin Castle Hotel. You can turn it into a longer circular walk by picking up footpaths along the River Clwyd which runs past the grounds. To extend your walking in the Ruthin area head along the river to enjoy lovely views of the Clwyd Valley. A nice riverside path runs north from the town toward Llawog. To the east of the town you can pick up the Offa's Dyke Path and follow it to the nearby Moel Famau Country Park. Here you can enjoy wonderful views of the Wirral, Merseyside, Snowdonia, the Dee Valley and the coast. Also nearby is Loggerheads Country Park and the Iron Age Hillfort at Moel Arthur .",
