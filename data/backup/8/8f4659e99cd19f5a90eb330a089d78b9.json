      "caption": "Magic Roundabout, Swindon. The Roundabout is actually five mini-roundabouts in a circle, meaning that the actual roundabout is not one-way. As can be seen from the sign in this picture 604478, one can travel in either direction as each of the five 'arms' of the roundabout is effectively a road in its own right. The chevrons in the middle thus correctly point anticlockwise. The junction used to be called County Island, but I guess Magic Roundabout was a nickname that stuck! In the background is the County Ground, the home of Swindon Town Football Club."
