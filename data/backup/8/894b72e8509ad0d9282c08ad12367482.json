    "description": "The West Wiltshire town of Bradford on Avon is a great place for walkers, officially recognised as a Walkers are Welcome town. There's good waterside paths along the canal and river, with waymarked trails also running into the surrounding countryside. This circular walk takes you along the Kennet and Avon Canal and the River Avon which both run through the area. You can start the walk just to the west of the train station on the riverside path. Follow it a short distance to the south and it will take you to the pretty Barton Farm Country Park. Here you will find historic buildings, craft shops and nice tea rooms for refreshments. There's also a farmhouse, granary and an impressive 14th century Tithe Barn. The monastic stone barn, is over 50 metres long, and includes a fine timber cruck roof. In the park you pick up the towpath of the canal and turn east, heading towards Trowbridge. This section passes Bradford Lock and the marina before coming to the river. Here you can pick up another footpath heading west past the golf course back into the town centre. If you have time you can also cross the river on Mckeever Bridge and visit the beautiful old Saxon Church on Church Street. The church dates from the 10th century and contains some wonderful architecture. To extend your walking in the area you could follow the canal in the other direction and visit Bath on our Bath Canal Walk. It's a lovely section of the canal with highlights including the Dundas Aqueduct and the villages of Monkton Combe and Bathampton. The long distance Macmillan Way also runs through the town. You can pick it up just to the east of the train station and explore the wider countryside. Following it north will take you to South Wraxall. If you follow it south west it will take you to the River Frome and Farleigh Hungerford. Also nearby is the pretty Southwick Country Park. Located just a few miles to the south of the town the 100 acre park has a series of good walking trails to try.",
