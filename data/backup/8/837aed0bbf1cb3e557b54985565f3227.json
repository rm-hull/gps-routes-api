  "description": "This delightful National Nature Reserve near Kippen has a 0.5 mile boardwalk trail to follow over the peat bogland. It's a fascinating and beautiful spot with sphagnum moss, heather, birches and cotton grass. Look out for a wide variety of wildlife including adders, lizards, snipe and stonechat. There is also a great viewing tower which you can climb for views over the reserve to the Trossachs. This short walk starts from the parking area just off the B822 north of Kippen and follows the boardwalk trail, visiting the viewing tower on the way.",
