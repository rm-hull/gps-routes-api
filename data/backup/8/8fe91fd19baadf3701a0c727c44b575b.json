  "description": "This walk visits the Scorhill Stone Circle and the Wallabrook Clapper Bridge in the Teign Valley of Dartmoor. The walk starts from the parking area at Scrohill Farm near Gidleigh. Here you can pick up a footpath along the River Teign Walk and follow it south west up to the stone circle on Scorhill Down. The site is an English Heritage scheduled monument and has been described as Devon's finest, most intact stone circle. It was constructed during the Bronze Age. If you continue a short way along the path you will soon come to the photogenic Wallabrook Clapper Bridge.",
