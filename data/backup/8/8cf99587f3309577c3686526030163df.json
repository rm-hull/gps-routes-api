  "description": "A short riverside walk from Richmond along the River Swale to the National Trust owned Hudswell Woods. You can start the walk from Richmond Bridge and then pick up the footpaths to Billy Bank Wood, Round Howe and Hudswell Woods. It's a lovely stroll through riverside woodland with bluebells, wild garlic, lesser celandines and wood anemones to look out for. There's lots of wildlife such as chiffchaff, blackcap, garden warblers and a variety of butterflies. The Richmond Way long distance footpath starts at Richmond so it's easy to extend your walking in the beautiful Swaledale. If you follow the trail west it will take you through Whitecliffe Wood to Applegarth Scar. Our Richmond Circular Walk visits the historic castle and the rushing waters of Richmond Falls.",
