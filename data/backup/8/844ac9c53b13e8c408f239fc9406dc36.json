The route visits the stepping stones in Dovedale before climbing the hill and returning to the town. The circular Fenny Bentley Walk also visits the hill from the pretty village to the east. The village is worthy of exploration with the pretty Bentley Brook, a 14th century church and a fine inn with particularly lovely gardens to see. The delightful village of Parwich lies just a few miles to the north east. There's a pretty village green, old limestone cottages and a pub dating back to the 1600s. You can reach the village on the Limestone Way which passes through both settlements."
