By the late sixteenth century the fabric of the castle began to decay, although James I stayed there a number of times between 1619 and 1624. It was then damaged during the English Civil War. When the Parliament seized control of the castle, they ordered the fortification to be destroyed; demolition work being carried out from 1647 to 1648. The castle often holds spectacular themed events including Vikings, Knights in Armour 1940s and Fairytale weekends."

  "description": "This pretty Staffordshire village sits in a lovely position next to the River Dove and the border with Derbyshire in the National Forest. This short circular walk around Tutbury visits the mill and castle in the village. The walk starts at the Tutbury Mill car park just to the north of the village near Tutbury Bridge on the River Dove. From here you can pick up a footpath heading west along the Mill Fleam to a weir. Here you head south and then east to visit the historic Tutbury Castle. Here you'll find the photogenic ruins of the medieval castle surrounded by a lovely Tudor garden. You can explore the ruins from where there are great views over the Derbyshire hills from its elevated position above the Dove. The route then heads through the village where there are some splendid old half timbered buildings.",
