  "description": "This Herefordshire based market town lies very close to the Welsh border. It's location next to Offa's Dyke and the wonderful Hergest Ridge make it a fine base for walking. There are also two significant waymarked footpaths passing through the town and the gorgeous Hergest Croft Gardens to visit. This circular walk around the town visits Rushock Hill, Herrock Hill and the River Arrow. It uses sections of the Mortimer Trail and the Offa's Dyke Path , two waymarked footpaths which run through the area. Start the walk in the town where you can pick up the Offa's Dyke Path. Follow the waymarked trail north and it will take you to Bradnor Green before climbing to Rushock Hill and Herrock Hill. You'll climb to over 1200ft in this area, with fine views over England and Wales to enjoy. You then turn east passing Knill Garraway Wood and picking up the Mortimer Trail. Follow the trail south past Rushock to Portway. Here you follow a footpath west along the River Arrow to return you to the town.",
