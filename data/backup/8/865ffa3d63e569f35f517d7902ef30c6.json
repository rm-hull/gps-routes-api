  "description": "Enjoy a walk to the beautiful Loch Shiel from Polloch on this delightful walk. The walk begins at the car park at Polloch and takes you along the River Polloch to the lochside on peaceful woodland footpaths. It's a beautiful, peaceful place with the surrounding mountains making a wonderful backdrop. Loch shiel is located 20 km (12.4 miles) west of Fort William in Lochaber. If you head to the north eastern end of the loch you can visit the magnificent Glenfinnan Viaduct and the Glenfinnan Monument. The monument, sits at the head of the loch, commemorating the Jacobite Rising of 1745, which began here when'Bonnie Prince Charlie' raised his standard on the shores of Loch Shiel. The Glenfinnan House Hotel can also be found here. It's a special place with a lovely lawn stretching down to the shores of the loch. You can sit outside and enjoy a drink with wonderful views. The hotel also has an interesting history, built as an inn between 1752 and 1755 by Alexander MacDonald VII of Glenaladale who was wounded at Culloden (1746) fighting for Prince Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie). It's located close to the pier at postcode PH37 4LT.",
