  "description": "Climb the Dragons Back on this challenging circular walk in the Black Mountains, Wales. The route runs for just over 7 miles and includes a visit to the highest point of the Black Mountains at Waun Fach. The views along the ridge are breathtaking in all directions. The walk starts from the parking area near Pengenffordd. Head north from here toward the village where you can pick up a trail heading east to Castell Dinas. This Iron Age hillfort\u00a0has the highest castle in England and Wales. A Norman castle was built here in the 11th century. What remains now are crumbling walls mainly covered with earth and the outlines of ditches and ramparts from the original Iron Age fortifications, commanding extensive views up into the\u00a0Black Mountains\u00a0and over Talgarth towards\u00a0Brecon. After exploring the fort the route continues east to Y Grib and Pen Y Manllwyn. Here you turn south to Waun Fach which stands at a height of 811 m (2,661 ft). From here there are views over the Brecon Beacons including Rhos Fawr\u00a0and the\u00a0Radnor Forest.\u00a0You may also see some wild ponies wandering around the area. The walk then descends to the south west toward Pen Trumau. Soon after you turn west along Rhiw Trumau and Cwmmfforest. The route then returns to the car park. You can enjoy well earned refreshments at the Castle Inn in Pengenffordd after your exercise. For a shorter walk you could try the climb to Waun Fach from the Castell Dinas car park.",
