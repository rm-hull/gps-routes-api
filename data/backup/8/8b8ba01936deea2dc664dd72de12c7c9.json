      "caption": "Capel island & Knockadoon Head and Headland taken from Caliso Beach. View across Youghal Bay. Capel Island and Knockadoon Head were designated as a national nature reserve by the Irish government in 1985, covering an area of 354 acres (1.43 km\u00b2). Most of this area, 314 acres, is state-owned, while 40 acres remain in private hands. The reserve encompasses Capel Island, Knockadoon Head, and the surrounding marine area. Knockadoon Head is notable for its historic signal tower, constructed in 1803 to monitor for possible French invasions during the Napoleonic Wars. The tower was abandoned in 1815 after the threat subsided. Visitors to the reserve can enjoy a looped cliff walk that offers stunning views of the coastline. In 2003, Knockadoon Head gained ornithological significance when a Hume's Warbler was recorded there, marking the first sighting of this bird species in Ireland. This adds to the area's appeal for birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts."
