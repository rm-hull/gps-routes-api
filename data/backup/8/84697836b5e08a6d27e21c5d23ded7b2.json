It once comprised several ranges of single storey buildings. This three storey building was probably a store for barrels of the finished product. Later it was used as a stable for the ironstone mine. Liquid alum was culverted from the workings to the alum house where further refining took place. Somewhere on the \"lawn\" a vertical shaft was sunk in 1683 leading to a tunnel at the bottom of the cliff 100' below. A horse gin would have operated to drop the barrels of alum down to waiting boats."

  "description": "This walk follows a fine section of the Cleveland Way from Saltburn to Staithes. The route runs for about 8 miles along an undulating, waymarked footpath. On the way there's some wonderful cliff top views, lots of seabirds, fascinating geology, lovely beaches and interesting villages to enjoy. The walk starts at Saltburn Sands Cliff, just a short distance from the train station. From here you can pick up the trail and follow it east, past Saltburn Scar to Hunt Cliff. You continue south east to Skinningrove, passing the pretty Cattersty Beach on the way. After leaving the village the path heads past Hummersea Point towards Boulby, passing Rockhole Hill on the way. At Boulby you will past some of the highest cliffs in England, standing at a height of 203 metres (666 ft) above sea level. The final section takes you past Cowbar Nab to finish at the delightful Staithes Harbour. Here you can enjoy a stroll through the characterful village with its old cobbled streets and little cottages. Also look out for the large seabird colony in the are which includes Kittiwake, Fulmar and Razorbill.",
