  "description": "This challenging circular walk climbs to Great Whernside, Blackfell Top and Blackfell Dike from the popular village of Kettlewell, in the Nidderdale area of the Yorkshire Dales. The route starts in the village and heads along the lovely Dowber Gill Beck where there's a series of pretty waterfalls. You continue to the Providence Pot cave where you turn left to Hag Dike. Turn right here and the path will take you directly up to the Great Whernside summit. It's a splendid viewpoint with views to the Lake District Fells, Pendle Hill, Wharfedale, Buckden Pike and the Pennines. After soaking in the summit views the route descends to Blackfell Top, Black Dike and Tor Dike, where there are more nice views down the valley to enjoy. The final section takes you along Starbotton Road before turning left down Top Mere Road. Follow the track for about 1.5 miles and it will return you to Kettlewell. For a more direct path to the summit try the Great Whernside Walk. The Dales Way long distance trail runs through the village. You could follow it north through Wharfedale to extend your exercise. It's a lovely riverside path which will take you to the village of Buckden where you can try the climb to Buckden Pike. Heading in the other direction will take you to Grassington. You can see more details on the Grassington to Kettlewell Walk .",

There's excellent views of the countryside of Wharfedale and the Littondale valley on this walk. Just to the north west of Arncliffe you can pick up the Littondale Walk. This starts from the nearby village of Litton and explores the northern end of the dale with more riverside trails and excellent views.
