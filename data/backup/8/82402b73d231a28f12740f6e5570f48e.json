  "description": "This walk explores the Smestow Valley Local Nature Reserve in Wolverhampton. The reserve is located to the west of the city centre on the pretty Smestow Brook. The site is great for an easy cycle or walk along the old South Staffordshire Railway Line which runs through the park. Features include meadows, scrubland and woodland with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. There's also easy waterside trails along the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. You could extend your outing by heading south west along the towpath to visit Wightwick Manor. The National Trust owned site includes an historic Victorian half-timbered Manor House with gardens and a collection of paintings and ceramics.",
