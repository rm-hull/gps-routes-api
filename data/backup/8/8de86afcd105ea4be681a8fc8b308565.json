  "description": "This route uses a section of the Chess Valley Walk and other public footpaths to create a circular walk through the area. On the way there's nice river trails, woodland paths and country views to enjoy. The walk starts from the tube station at Chorleywood on the\u00a0Metropolitan line\u00a0of the\u00a0London Underground. From here you can pick up the Chess Valley Walk and follow it north east through Chorleywood Common to the Chorleywood House Estate . There's some lovely grounds here with ponds, gardens, sculptures and woodland to explore. After passing the house you soon arrive at the River Chess where you follow the river path north west to Sarratt Bottom and Latimer . Here you cross the river and head east through woodland to Chenies where there's a splendid manor house and grounds. After exploring the house you head south along the Chiltern Heritage Trail and the Chiltern Way to Halsey's Wood and Carpenter's Wood where you turn south east. Shortly after passing through the wood you arrive back at Chorleywood station.",
