  "description": "This North Yorkshire based village sits in a lovely spot close to the Lake District National Park, the Forest of Bowland AONB and the Yorkshire Dales. There's plenty of good walking options, with country trails and waterside paths along the River Greta which flows through the village. This short walk from the village takes you west along the river to Greta Wood and the weir. There's some lovely views along the tree lined, peaceful river in this delightful scenic spot. To continue your walking in the area you could head south to visit neighbouring Bentham where there's some nice trails along the River Wenning. Also nearby is a major local highlight at the popular Ingleton Falls .",
