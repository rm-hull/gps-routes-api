  "description": "This walk visits an ancient Iron Age Hillfort and viewpoint in South Devon near Loddiswell . As well as its archeological significance the hill fort commands fine views over the area from its 185 metres (607 ft) high summit. You can start the walk from the reasonably sized public car park off a country lane just south west of the site. From here you can follow footpaths north east up to the hill top. The area includes some picnic benches where you can relax and enjoy lunch with a view. Flora and fauna are also in abundance with pretty bluebells in the spring and buzzards to look out for overhead. You could extend the walk by heading west and visiting the Andrew's Wood Nature Reserve. It's only about 15 minute walk from the car park and has some nice woodland and heathland trails to try.",
