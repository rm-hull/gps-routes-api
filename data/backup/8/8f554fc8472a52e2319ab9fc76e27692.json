Catering to various skill levels, these routes provide an exciting way to explore the forest and its rich history. The trails, designed for children and families, offer a glimpse into the area's heritage. For more experienced riders, there are blue, red, and black routes that offer different levels of challenge. The red route, featuring a thrilling section called Spooky Woods with numerous bermed corners, is particularly popular. Additionally, there's a green trail designed as a \"skills loop\" for beginners, although it also offers challenges for riders looking to practice rocky sections or elevated wooden trails. In August 2023, Glentress hosted the UCI MTB World Championships, attracting elite mountain bikers from around the world."

At the summit of Janet's Brae, remnants of an Iron Age hill fort can be found, providing breathtaking views of Peebles town. A brief stroll leads to the spot where a reconstruction of an Iron Age timber roundhouse once stood before being destroyed by fire in 2010."

  "description": "This expansive forest is located near Peebles in the Scottish Borders. There's miles of great walking trails and some of the best mountain bike trails in the country. This circular route starts from the main visitor centre and car park. From here you can pick up the Multi User Trail and link up with the Buzzard\u2019s Nest Trail and the Glen Trail. The waymarked walks will take you to the pretty Glentress Burn, picturesque ponds and a fine viewpoint at Cardie Hill. Keep your eyes peeled for wildlife such as herons, bats and red squirrels on the way. You can see the mountain bike (mtb) routes mapped in blue on the Open Street Map below. The video below also gives a good idea of what you expect to find at the site.",
