The bridge is one of the finest medieval bridges in the south-east of England. It is just downstream of the automatic sluice where the river drops from +11.2m to +7.41m above mean sea level. The navigation bears left through Hampstead Road Canal and Hampstead Lock; the main stream drops over the weir and sluice and is joined by the River Teise (Lesser Teise) and both pass under Twyford Bridge. The river then flows in a loop towards Yalding, where it is joined by the River Beult which has been joined by the River Teise (the other bit!) and has passed under Town Bridge. Twyford Bridge is not navigable and about 10 miles from Allington Lock."

  "description": "This little Kent based village is situated in a pleasant spot next to the River Medway, a few miles south west of Maidstone. This circular walk from Wateringbury takes you along the River Medway and the Yalding Canal also visiting the neighbouring villages of Nettlestead, Yalding and West Farleigh. The walk starts just south of the village at Wateringbury train station where you can pick up the Medway Valley Walk and follow the waymarked trail south to the Medway Wharf Marina, Nettlestead and Twyford Bridge. The bridge is a very photogenic medieval structure and one of the highlights of the village. You can cross the bridge and then follow country lanes to Yalding. The route then heads north through the countryside to West Farleigh before picking up the river path and heading west to return to the train station.",
