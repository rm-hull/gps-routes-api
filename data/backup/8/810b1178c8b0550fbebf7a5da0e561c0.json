  "description": "This Staffordshire based village has some nice riverside trails along the River Dove and through the nearby Churnet Valley. There's also some interesting history with a 16th century church and the site of a 12th century ruined abbey to visit. This walk from the village uses part of the Limestone Way to visit some of the highlights of the area including Calwich Abbey Abbey, the River Dove, Norbury and the ancient Rocester Roman Fort. The walk starts at the public car park in the village and heads south to link up with the Limestone Way. You can follow this waymarked footpath south along the River Dove to Riverside Doveley, crossing into Derbyshire at Norbury. The Dove is notable as the historic boundary between the two counties of Derbyshire and Staffordshire. The route then continues past Dalesgap before coming to Rocester. In this historic village a Roman fort was founded in about 69 AD, as an intermediate point between Derby and Newcastle Under Lyme on a route later known as Long Lane. The remains of the earthworks can still be seen today. The route then retraces its steps before turning east to visit Norbury with its weir and old church. You then cross the Dove before following footpaths around Calwich Park and Abbey. The route then returns to the village via Upper Ellastone.",
