This shows the wider piece of canal where boats can perform the equivalent of a three point turn in order to go back the way they came. An indentation in the bank allows the bows of a narrowboat to be held whilst the prevailing wind blows the boat round. Hence the unusual pronunciation - \u0091winding hole\u0092. The road is Newton Lane and the green contraption mounted by the side of the bridge is a pipeline bridge."

  "description": "This Leicestershire based hamlet is a fine place to visit with a variety of attractions and an interesting history. It includes the\u00a0popular Wistow Maze, a Rural Centre with a large garden centre, a model village, a cafe/bistro, a Mediterranean deli and an art gallery. It's a lovely place for a walk too, with some attractive countryside and waterside paths along the Grand Union Canal and the River Sence. This circular walk starts from the car park and follows footpaths south towards Fleckney. You then turn north east to meet up with the canal before turning west to past the site of the old medieval village of Wistowe. Shortly after you pass the small lake next to Wistow Hall and return to the car park. On the way you'll also pass the historic church which dates back to the 12th century and is worth some investigation.",
