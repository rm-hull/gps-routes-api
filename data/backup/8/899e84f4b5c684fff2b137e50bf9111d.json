This shows the wider piece of canal where boats can perform the equivalent of a three point turn in order to go back the way they came. An indentation in the bank allows the bows of a narrowboat to be held whilst the prevailing wind blows the boat round. Hence the unusual pronunciation - \u0091winding hole\u0092. The road is Newton Lane and the green contraption mounted by the side of the bridge is a pipeline bridge."

  "description": "This Leicestershire based hamlet is a fine place to visit with a variety of attractions and an interesting history. It includes the popular Wistow Maze, a Rural Centre with a large garden centre, a model village, a cafe/bistro, a Mediterranean deli and an art gallery. It's a lovely place for a walk too, with some attractive countryside and waterside paths along the Grand Union Canal and the River Sence. This circular walk starts from the car park and follows footpaths south towards Fleckney. You then turn north east to meet up with the canal before turning west to past the site of the old medieval village of Wistowe. Shortly after you pass the small lake next to Wistow Hall and return to the car park. On the way you'll also pass the historic church which dates back to the 12th century and is worth some investigation.",

      "content": "For a longer walk you could continue round on the canal to Newton Harcourt and Kilby where you can pick up country paths to take you back towards Wistow. Continuining north west along the canal will eventually take you into Leicester where you can try the Leicester Canal and River Soar Walk. Just south of Fleckney you can pick up the Leicestershire Round. This long circular walk explores the countryside and villages around the city of Leicester. Heading east will take you to the attractive market town of Uppingham where you can enjoy a stroll to the pretty Eyebrook Reservoir. The popular town of Market Harborough is just to the south east and has some nice canal walks to try. A few miles to the east there's Hallaton to explore. The village includes a particularly picturesque pond, a 13th century church and quaint thatched cottages. Hallaton is also the location for the famous annual bottle kicking contest which takes place on Easter Monday. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks page."
