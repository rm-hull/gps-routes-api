  "description": "This walk uses a section of the Stour Valley Way to create a circular walk around Throop Mill on the outskirts of Bournemouth. You'll visit the interesting old mill before exploring the pretty Stour Valley Nature Reserve where there's lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. Start the walk at the car park at Throop next to the river and mill. It's located on the Throop Road, less than half a mile behind Castlepoint, between Holdenhurst and Muslcliffe. The mill is in a very picturesque and peaceful setting with a weir, watermill and the thatched Throop Mill cottage. From here you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it west through the Stour Valley Nature Reserve to Muslcliffe and Ensbury. Look out for wildlife such as otters and kingfishers as you make your way through the reserve. At Ensbury you cross the river to follow a countryside path back through Parley Green where there's a nice pond, golf course and attractive farmland to see. The last section heads through Merritown before turning south to return you to Throop. To extend the walk continue east along the path to visit the lovely Christchurch Harbour .",
