  "description": "This nature reserve near Falmouth has a series of walking trails to follow. The reserve consists of woodland with pretty streams and interesting flora and fauna to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for the pipistrelle bat and a variety of woodland birds. It's a lovely shady spot with the rushing waters of the River Kennall and the sound of the birds in the trees. The area also has an interesting history with the ruins, leats and waterwheel houses of Kennall Vale Gunpowder Works. You can start the walk from the little village of Ponsanooth which lies just to the east of the reserve. To extend your walking in the area then you could visit the nearby Stithians Lake. The country park includes nice cycling and walking trails around a large lake.",
