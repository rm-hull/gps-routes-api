  "description": "This circular walk takes you through this peaceful common near Crowthorne. There are a number of delightful woodland trails, heather, bracken and two tranquil ponds to relax next to. From the high points on the ridges there are wonderful views over the River Blackwater Valley. The walk also visits Simon's Wood where there is a very large Heath Pond. You can start the walk from the National Trust car park here at a postcode of RG45 6AE for your sat navs. Also look out for a variety of wildlife including the Green Woodpecker in this peaceful area. You can easily extend your walk by heading to the nearby Tri Lakes Country Park, Horseshoe Lake or Yately Common Country Park for more lovely walking trails.",
