  "description": "Climb to the 'Matterhorn of Wales' on this challenging walk from the village of Croesor in Gwynedd. Although several thousand metres lower, Cnicht has a similar appearance to the famous mountain of the Alps. It's about a 2 mile walk from the village to the 689 m (2,260 ft) summit. It's generally a good stony path with some grassy sections as well. There is some scrambling required as you make your way to the top though. Cnicht is generally a very peaceful place with stunning views to the coast at Porthmadog from the summit. The walk begins in Croesor where there is a small car park. Then head north out of the village on a country lane before a stony track climbs through woodland. When you come out of the woodland section there are splendid views of the surrounding hills and mountains. The path continues in a north easterly direction, climbing steadily towards the summit. You can turn it into a longer circular walk by descending to Cwm Croseor and returning along the Afon Croesor. You can virtually climb to Cnicht using the google street view link below!",
