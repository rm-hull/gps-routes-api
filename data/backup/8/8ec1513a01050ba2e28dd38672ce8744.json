  "description": "This coastal village is located in the East Riding of Yorkshire. It's a nice place for a stroll with a historic castle, beach walks and a Grade I listed 11th century church to see. This walk from the village takes you to Skipsea Castle before heading to Skipsea Sands for an easy walk along the beach to the neighbouring village of Atwick. The walk starts in the village centre and heads west to visit Skipsea Castle . The site is run by English Heritage and includes the remains of a Norman motte and bailey castle, dating from before 1086. You can climb to the top of the mound and enjoy some nice views over the area. The site also includes an Iron Age fort and an information board with more details. The castle can be found at Beeford Road, YO25 8TH. After exploring the castle the walk then heads east back to the village before following a pleasant country lane to the coast. Here you can enjoy a walk south along the beach to the neighbouring village of Atwick, passing the Far Grange Park golf course and holiday caravan sites. On the way you will see evidence of significant coastal erosion which has left some properties very close to the edge.",
