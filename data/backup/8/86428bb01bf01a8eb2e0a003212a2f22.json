  "description": "This circular walk takes you on a tour of the lovely Rossendale area of Lancashire and Greater Manchester. The path passes Haslingden, Rawtenstall, Whitworth, Stubbins and Healey with a series of attractive reservoirs including Cowpe and Calf Hey real highlights. Near Calf Hey you'll cross Holcombe Moor where you'll pass Musbury Tor and the Peel Tower. The distinctive monument is dedicated to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th century Prime Minister considered the father of modern British policing. It's a major local landmark and worth the climb to the top for the views over the area. The walk also takes you through the delightful Healey Dell Nature Reserve with waterfalls and wildlife to enjoy here. The views of the South Pennine hills are also splendid and make a fine backdrop to the walk.",
