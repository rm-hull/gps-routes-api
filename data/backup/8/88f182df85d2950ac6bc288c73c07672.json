  "description": "This large town in Merseyside is located on the Wirral Peninsula, along the west bank of the River Mersey, opposite the city of Liverpool. The town includes a significant public park which is a great place for an easy stroll. There's lakes, woodland and pretty gardens to visit on a series of surfaced footpaths. Birkenhead Park is the first publicly funded park in the UK. It is also notable as the inspiration for the most famous urban park in the world \u2013 Central Park in New York. The area is also architecturally significant with a number of notable listed buildings. Look out for 'The Grand Entrance' which was designed by Lewis Hornblower and is located at the northeast corner. The piece consists of three arches flanked by lodges and is in Ionic style. The photogenic Swiss Bridge spans the pretty lake and is unique as being the only covered bridge of traditional wooden construction in the UK. There is also a Pavilion called the Roman Boathouse next to the lake, the upper storey of which was originally intended to be a bandstand. The park includes good facilities with an excellent visitor centre and cafe for refreshments after your walk. To continue your walking in the area, head west to Bidston Hill. Here you will find 100 of acres heathland and woodland with historic buildings and ancient rock carvings. At the western end of the town there's Arrowe Country Park with wildflower meadows, ponds, a lake and a brook attracting a variety of wildlife.",
