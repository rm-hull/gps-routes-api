Bunkers built against the cliff were used to store the quarried rock."

  "description": "This circular walk on Anglesey visits the Porth Wen Brickworks before heading to the nearby Dinas Gynfor coastal hillfort and Llanlleiana Porcelain Works. It's an interesting area with fascinating history and wonderful coastal views. The route runs for just under 3 miles with some small hill climbs on the way. It uses a mixture of public footpaths and quiet country lanes. There's also a section along the Anglesey Coast Path which runs through the area. You can start the walk from the road just to the west of the site where there is some roadside parking. From here you can pick up footpaths up to the brickworks. The scheduled ancient monument consists of a disused Victorian brickworks which produced fire bricks, made from quartzite (silica) used to line steel-making furnaces. The remains include a number of buildings and some of the machinery. It's a photgoenic spot with the coastal scenery making a wonderful backdrop to the old buildings. After exploring the site you can pick up the coast path and follow it west to Hell's Mouth or Porth Cynfor and the hill fort of Dinas Gynfor. From the elevated position of the fort there are fine views down to Porth Llanlleiana and across to Middle Mouse island. Just to the south of the fort you will find Llanlleiana Porcelain Works. Here you'll find more ruined buildings, which when operational, produced porcelain from deposits of china clay found on Dinas Gynfor. After exploring the site the route heads east along the country lane passing Bryn Llewelyn before returning to the start point.",
