  "description": "Enjoy peaceful, waterside walking and cycling at Leybourne Lakes Country Park, near Maidstone in Kent. In the park you will find 230 acres of lakes and woodland providing a peaceful location for wildlife and birdwatching. The expansive park includes several lakes with the River Medway running along the eastern section of the park. You could extend your walk outside the park by picking up the Medway Valley Walk and heading along the riverside path. Following it south will take you into nearby Aylesford while heading north will take you past Burham Marshes to Wouldham.",

If you fancy a pub lunch then there's the Freemasons Arms in nearby Snodland. The pub dates to 1753 and serves good quality dishes. They have an excellent outdoor area with a covered Pergola and patio area which can accommodate seating for over one hundred customers. You can find them at 267 Malling Road, Snodland, ME6 5JR. They have a large car park and are also dog friendly. Snodland is also a nice place for a stroll with its Tudor Mulberry Cottages on the High Street and an ancient church dating to the 12th century. Our walk from the train station in the town visits the Holborough Marshes Nature Reserve where you can look out for a wide variety of wildlife next to the River Medway."
