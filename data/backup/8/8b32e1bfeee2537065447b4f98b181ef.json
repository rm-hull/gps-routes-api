The expansive park includes several lakes with the River Medway running along the eastern section of the park. You could extend your walk outside the park by picking up the Medway Valley Walk and heading along the riverside path. Following it south will take you into nearby Aylesford while heading north will take you past Burham Marshes to Wouldham.",
