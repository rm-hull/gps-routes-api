While most of the trail is within Derbyshire, it also crosses into Staffordshire, Cheshire, and Yorkshire. The walk\u2019s highest point is at Shutlingsloe, which stands at 506 metres (1,660 ft) above sea level, contributing to the total ascent of 7,590 metres (24,900 ft) throughout the trail."

For those interested in tackling this long-distance route, an official guide by Andrew McCloy is available, providing detailed insights and guidance for the journey. In August 2022, ultra runner Catharine Crossley set a remarkable record by completing the entire route in just 3 days, 11 hours, and 21 minutes, showcasing the walk's appeal not only to hikers but also to endurance athletes. This walk is a fantastic way to explore the boundary of the Peak District, with its rich history and stunning natural beauty."
