For those interested in tackling this long-distance route, an official guide by Andrew McCloy is available, providing detailed insights and guidance for the journey.\nIn August 2022, ultra runner Catharine Crossley set a remarkable record by completing the entire route in just 3 days, 11 hours, and 21 minutes, showcasing the walk's appeal not only to hikers but also to endurance athletes.\nThis walk is a fantastic way to explore the boundary of the Peak District, with its rich history and stunning natural beauty."
