  "description": "This walk climbs to the summit of Pendle Hill in Lancashire. It starts in the delightful village of Barley and makes use of the Pendle Way long distance footpath to take you on a circular tour of the area. It's a steep climb but the path is pretty well defined for most of the way. From the 557 metre (1,827 ft) summit there are fabulous views over the Pennines to the east, the Bowland Fells to the northwest, and the West Pennine Moors to the south. After leaving the summit you descend to Boar Clough before enjoying two waterside stretches along the Upper and Lower Ogden Reservoirs. The path then leads you back into Barley. The area is famous for the Pendle Witch Trials. These took place in 1612 when twelve people from the area were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft. Ten were subsequently found guilty and executed by hanging. To extend your walking in the area you could try the Pendle Hill Witches Walk. The double looped trail  visits several local landmarks connected to the accused, while also exposing you to some lovely Lancashire scenery. You could also head to the nearby Black Moss Reservoir. The reservoirs are easily reached from Barley village and are a great place to see a wide variety of wildlife. There are also great views up to Pendle Hill from here. The hill is located close to the town of Clitheroe. The attractive town has a train station and makes for an alternative start point for the climb.",
