  "description": "This attractive Lancashire village is located in a lovely position in the Forest of Bowland. This walk from the village picks up the long distance Hodder Way and follows it up to the delightful Dunsop Bridge which is the gateway to the popular Trough of Bowland . It's about a 10 mile hike up to the Trough from the village but you have the option of catching a bus part of the way back to save your legs! Starting in the village you head east to the River Hodder at Doeford Bridge. Cross the river and head north and it will take you past the splendid Inn at Whitewell before coming to Dunsop Bridge. The pretty village lies very close to the geographic centre of Great Britain at the confluence of the River Dunsop and the River Hodder. Head west and it will take you along the Langdon Brook to one of the most scenic areas of the AONB at the Trough of Bowland. Also near the village is the climb to Parlick and Fair Snape Fell which provides fabulous views over the area. There's also the Forest of Bowland Walk and nice waterside trails around Stocks Reservoir . Beacon Fell Country Park , Brock Bottom , Calder Vale and Longridge Fell are also reachable from the village.",
