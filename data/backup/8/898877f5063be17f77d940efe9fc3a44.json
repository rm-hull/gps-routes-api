  "description": "This park near Carshalton has good footpaths to follow along the River Wandle and around the pretty lake. There are 58 hectares of landscaped wooded park and the Carew family Manor house to enjoy. Beddinton Park has a fascinating history with the site of a Roman villa and bath-house at the northern side of the park. The park can be accessed from the nearby Hackbridge Station. If you are coming by bike then you can follow the Wandle Trail from Wandsworth or Croydon. If you head north you will soon come to Morden Hall Park and Mitcham Common. You can virtually explore part of the park using the google street view link below!",
