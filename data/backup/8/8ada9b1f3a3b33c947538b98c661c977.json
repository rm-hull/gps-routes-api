The trail forms part of National Cycle Route 57 (the Oxford to Welwyn Garden City route), and runs for about eight miles on a flat path.

The Hollybush dates from the 16th century and does a fine Sunday roast which you can enjoy in the nice garden area to the rear. You can find them at postcode AL3 7DU. There's also the Cricketer's which is in a lovely spot overlooking Redbourn Common. They also serve high quality food and can be found at postcode AL3 7ND. Both pubs are also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."
