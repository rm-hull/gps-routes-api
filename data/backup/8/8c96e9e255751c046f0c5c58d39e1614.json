  "description": "This walk visits Killary Fjord or Habrour in northern\u00a0Connemara.\u00a0There's some wonderful scenery here with the fjord flanked by the mountains of\u00a0Mweelrea\u00a0and\u00a0Ben Gorm. The 16km long fjord is one of just three glacial fjords that exist in Ireland, the others being Lough Swilly and Carlingford Lough . The walk starts in Leenaun where there are some facilities and a car park near to the Fjord. From here you can pick up a section of the Western Way and follow it west along the water before climbing into the hills above the harbour. From here you can enjoy some wonderful views back down to the fjord and to the surrounding hills and mountains. To continue your walking in the area head south west to visit the 19th century Kylemore Abbey . The popular estate includes loughside trails, a Victorian walled garden, woodland paths and excellent views of the surrounding\u00a0Twelve Bens Mountains.",
