  "description": "Explore the stunning gardens surrounding this fine house in the village of Minterne Magna in Dorset. The house has been the home of the Churchill's and Digby's family for the last 350 years. The first Sir Winston Churchill rented Minterne from Winchester College in 1660, and left it to his younger son General Charles Churchill. His widow then sold the house to Robert Digby. The house is surrounded by wonderful gardens with good footpaths taking you to lakes, waterfalls and streams with delightful little bridges. Flora and fauna includes Himalayan Rhododendrons and Azaleas, Cherries, and Maples. The gardens are generally open daily between mid February and early November but check the website link below for more details. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Wessex Ridgeway and follow it to the nearby Cerne Abbas Giant .",
