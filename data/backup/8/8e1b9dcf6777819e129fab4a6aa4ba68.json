  "description": "Explore the stunning gardens surrounding this fine house in the village of Minterne Magna in Dorset. The house has been the home of the Churchill's and Digby's family for the last 350 years. The first Sir Winston Churchill rented Minterne from Winchester College in 1660, and left it to his younger son General Charles Churchill. His widow then sold the house to Robert Digby. The house is surrounded by wonderful gardens with good footpaths taking you to lakes, waterfalls and streams with delightful little bridges. Flora and fauna includes Himalayan Rhododendrons and Azaleas, Cherries, and Maples. The gardens are generally open daily between mid February and early November but check the website link below for more details. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Wessex Ridgeway and follow it to the nearby Cerne Abbas Giant .",

The village has strong connections with Thomas Hardy and includes a noteworthy 16th century pub and walking trails to the nearby Melbury Park Estate. The Frome Valley Trail can also be picked up here and followed along the picturesque river to Maiden Newton and Dorchester. Just to the south west is the neighbouring village of Sydling St Nicholas. It's a delightful place with thatched 18th century cottages on a chocolate box High Street, a noteworthy 15th century church and a fine centuries old pub. There's also nice walks along the pretty Sydling Water here. You can follow the Wessex Ridgeway Trail north east for about 2 miles to reach the village."
