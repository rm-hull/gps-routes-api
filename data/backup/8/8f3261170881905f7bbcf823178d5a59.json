  "description": "This Lancashire based town is in a great place for exploring the River Irwell and the Rossendale Valley. There's also miles of footpaths and hill climbs over the surrounding Pennine Moors to enjoy. This route makes use of sections of the Irwell Sculpture Trail , the Pennine Bridleway and the Rossendale Way to create a circular walk around the town. The walk starts near the town centre near the train station on the heritage East Lancs Railway . You can pick up the Irwell Sculpture Trail and follow the waymarked footpath east along the river towards Hareholme and Waterfoot. Here you can pick up the Pennine Bridleway and follow the shared cycling and walking trail south towards Cowpe Lowe and Black Hill. You then pick up the Rossendale Way and follow it south to Tottington Higher End Moor, passing Scout Moor and Whittle Hill to your west. At the Grain Brook the route bends to the west passing Turf Moor and Fecit Hill before coming back to the River Irwell near Chatterton. Follow the riverside trail north and it will take you past Ewood Bridge before returning to Rawtenstall.",
