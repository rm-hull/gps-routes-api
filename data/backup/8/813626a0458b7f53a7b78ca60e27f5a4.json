  "description": "This walk follows a lovely section of the Fife Coastal Path from Pittenweem to Anstruther. It's about a 2 mile walk along a fairly flat, waymarked footpath. The route starts in Pittenweem, a historic fishing village on the Fife coast. Highlights in the picturesque village include the artisan chocolatiers, 17th century buildings, fine shops, galleries and the ancient St Fillan's Cave. In the village you can pick up the waymarked coastal trail and follow it east past St Fillan's Cave to the Anstruther golf course and the striking coastline at Billow Ness. The route then passes along the attractive Anstruther Harbour before finishing in the town.",
