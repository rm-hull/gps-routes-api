  "description": "This Dorset based market town has some nice walks along the River Stour and in the Dorset AONB to try. This route uses sections of the Stour Valley Way and the North Dorset Trailway to create a circular walk around the town. On the way there's nice views of the river and a visit to the local villages of Durweston and Stourpaine. The walk starts on Blandford Bridge which crosses the Stour to the south of the town centre. From here you can pick up the Stour Valley Way long distance footpath. Follow the waymarked trail north east passing the lovely Crown Meadows and Deer Park. The trail continues to Bryanston and Durweston where you cross the river. A short stroll from here is the village of Stourpaine where you can stop for refreshments at the popular White Horse Inn. There's also lots of pretty thatched cottages and an old church to see here. After exploring the village the route picks up the North Dorset Trailway, a shared cycling and walking trail running along a dismantled railway line from Stalbridge to Spetisbury . The trail will lead you all the way back into the town centre where the route finishes. Here you can enjoy refreshments at the fine Crown Hotel on West Street. To extend your walking around Blandford you pick up the Jubilee Trail near Durweston and follow it into Blandford Forest where there's miles of cycling and walking trails to try.",
