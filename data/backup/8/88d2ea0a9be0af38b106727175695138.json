  "description": "The Wysis Way runs for 55 miles from Monmouth in Wales to Kemble, in Gloucestershire. The way links the Offa's Dyke Path and Thames Path national trails. Starting from the Wye Bridge in Monmouth the Wysis Way heads eastwards up to The Kymin and on into the Forest of Dean. Continuing east the trail goes through Hillersland before continuing through the Forest, passing through Nailsbridge, Harrow Hill and Mitcheldean on its way to the top of May Hill where there are fabulous views of the River Severn. From May Hill, it continues eastward through Glasshouse, Taynton, Tibberton and the edge of Highnam before reaching Gloucester. At Gloucester, the trail heads south east to Robinswood Hill, before continuing southeasterly through Painswick, Bisley and Oakridge Lynch before reaching its end in Kemble, where it meets the Thames Path.",
