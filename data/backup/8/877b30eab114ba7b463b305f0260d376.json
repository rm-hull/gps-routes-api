During this imprisonment she was forced to abdicate in favour of her son King James IV. With some help from residual loyals she escaped to regain some support but was routed at the Battle of Langside (Glasgow). Exiled from Scotland she put her faith in cousin the English Queen Elizabeth I, who allowed her Fotheringhay Castle as a place of 'house arrest'."

  "description": "This splendid circular walk follows a footpath around the whole of Loch Leven in Kinross. It's a beautiful area and also a National Nature Reserve so there's plenty of good wildlife spotting opportunites on the way. The route is also suitable for cyclists and runs for a distance of about 20km (12 miles). The walk starts at the car park at Kinross House on the north western side of the loch. There's nice views out to Kinross Castle which sits on an island in the northern part of the loch. From the car park you pick up the trail and follow it west through the attractive Kirkgate Park. You then pass along the western side of the loch before coming to the Vane Farm Nature Reserve. This RSPB reserve is a great place to see Ospreys which visit the loch to fish during the summer, while up to 20,000 pink-footed geese fly in from Iceland come autumn. There's a visitor centre and car park if you'd prefer to start the walk from here. The trail then passes along the southern section of the loch where there are nice views out to St Serf's Island where there are the ruins of Augustinian Priory founded in 1150. The path then runs along the eastern side of the water, with some woodland sections and waterside paths to enjoy. There's a short climb to Grieg Hill where there are fine views over the loch. The final section then takes you past the golf course before returning to the car park. To continue your walking in the area just head south to Lochore Meadows Country Park . There's another wonderful waterside trail to follow along Loch Ore with woodlands, meadows, grasslands, ponds and a Nature Reserve.",
