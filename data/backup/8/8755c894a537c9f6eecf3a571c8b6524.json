  "description": "This pretty riverside village is a nice place to enjoy a walk through the surrounding countryside of the Nidderdale AONB. This circular walk from the village visits the River Nidd, Hartwith and Old Spring Wood. The walk starts in the village on Summer Bridge where you can pick up the Nidderdale Way and follow the waymarked trail south along the Nidd. The route leaves the river near Darley, heading north to Harwith and Old Spring wood where there are some pleasant woodland trails and lots of bluebells in the spring. You can extend the walk at Old Spring Wood by heading a couple of miles north to visit Brimham Rocks. The elevated rocks are a local highlight with some fascinating geologily and wonderful views to enjoy. Just to the west of here there's the Pateley Bridge Circular Walk where you can enjoy more waterside walking along the expansive Gouthwaite Reservoir .",
