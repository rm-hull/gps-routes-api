  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Uldale Force waterfall on the River Rawthey in Cumbria. The area also includes a series of other smaller waterfalls so is a bit of a hidden gem of this part of the Yorkshire Dales. You can start the walk from the public parking area near Rawthey bridge a couple of miles north west of the falls. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south east to Wraygreen, Uldale House and Blea Gill Bridge before coming to the falls near Whin Stone Gill Bridge. Along the way there's nice views of the River Rawthey which flows through a narrow limestone gorge to the secluded falls. You can extend the walk by continuing south east to visit Garsdale. It's a beautiful place with trails along the Grisedale Beck and more pretty waterfalls to see. You can also pick up the scenic Settle and Carlisle Line from Garsdale Railway station here. The station offers an alternative start point for the walk to Uldale Force by providing a public transport option.",
