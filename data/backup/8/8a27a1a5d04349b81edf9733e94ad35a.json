The first recorded mention of a mill at Worsbrough dates back to the Domesday Book of 1086, although the exact location of this early mill along the River Dove remains unknown. The oldest existing part of the mill today dates from around 1625 and forms the two-storey stone structure known as the Old Mill, which houses the waterwheel. Before the construction of the Mill House in the mid-18th century, the miller and his family would have lived within the mill itself. The Old Mill features large fireplaces on both the ground and first floors, with the lintel over the first-floor fireplace inscribed with various dates and the initials of the millers who lived there."

In the 1840s, the New Mill was constructed next to it, equipped with machinery powered by a steam engine, and a third floor was added for bulk grain storage. However, towards the late 19th century, the demand for corn and flour began to decline due to the influx of cheaper imported wheat. By the early 20th century, Worsbrough's New Mill had fallen into disuse, and the steam engine was scrapped, though the Old Mill continued to grind corn and oats for local farmers well into the 1960s."

Since the original steam engine had been scrapped in 1922, a rare 1911 Hornsby hot-bulb oil engine, previously located at Sykehouse Windmill, was rebuilt in the engine room. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, South Yorkshire County Council took over the project, and the museum officially opened to the public in 1976. Today, the mill is owned and operated by Barnsley Council."
