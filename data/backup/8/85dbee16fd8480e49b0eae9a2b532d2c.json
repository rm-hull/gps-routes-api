With an area of about 48 square kilometres (19 sq mi), it is Ireland's seventh largest lake.  With its immediate neighbour to the south, Lough Cullin, it is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the River Moy. Lough Conn is noted for its trout and salmon fishing."

  "description": "This walk visits the historic Errew Abbey on Lough Conn in County Mayo. The ancient abbey is located in a fine spot on a peninsula stretching into Lough Conn. There is a footpath at the end of a country lane on the western side of the lake that will take you to the remote spot. It's a photogenic area with the lough and its islands making a fine backdrop to the abbey ruins. There are also views across the water to Nephin, the highest standalone mountain in Ireland and the second-highest peak in Connacht. To continue your walking in the area head east to try the circular walk around the pretty Lough Talt ."
