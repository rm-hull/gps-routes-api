  "description": "This walk climbs to Haverthwaite Heights near the Cumbrian village of Haverthwaite. The little village is located just to the south west of the southern tip of Lake Windermere, near the edge of the Lake District National Park. You can start the walk from Haverthwaite Railway Station on the heritage Lakeside & Haverthwaite Railway. You can catch a boat from Bowness to the Lakeside station on Windermere and then catch the popular tourist train to the village. From the station you can pick up trails heading up to the heights. Here you will find woodland paths, rocky outcrops and some good views from the high points. To continue your walking around the village head south to pick up the Cumbria Coastal Way. You could follow the waymarked footpath west to visit Greenodd and enjoy some lovely views over Greenodd Sands and the Channel of the River Leven. You can also pick up a lovely easy path along the Rusland Pool, a pretty stream running north through the Rusland Valley to the neighbouring village of Bouth .",
