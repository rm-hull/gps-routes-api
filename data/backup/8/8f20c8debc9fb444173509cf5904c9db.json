  "description": "Enjoy miles of splendid walking trails in this stunning 18th century landscaped park in Cobham, Surrey. There's 158 acres to explore with lovely waterside footpaths along the large Serpentine Lake and a number of peaceful woodland trails. The River Mole also runs through the southern side of the site. This circular walk takes you around the lake and the grounds with a small hill climb on the way. The park includes several interesting 18th century buildings including The Ruined Abbey, Turkish Tent, Gothic Temple and Gothic Tower. There is also a vineyard, a large working waterwheel and a fascinating crystal grotto with thousands of crystals including calcite, gypsum and quartz. The park is also great for flora and fauna. There are many fine specimen trees in distinct areas including the amphitheatre, water meadow and alpine valley. Look out for frogs, toads, various fish and birds around the lake. Most of the paths are fairly flat but you can enjoy a climb to Tower Hill on the western side of the park. Here you'll find a gothic tower with nice views across the surrounding woodland. If you'd like to extend your walk you could head to the nearby Wisley Gardens. It's a stunning garden and located only a couple of miles away, on the other side of Wisley and Ockham Common where there's also miles of nice footpaths to try.",
