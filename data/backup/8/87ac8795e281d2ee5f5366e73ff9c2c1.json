  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll around these beautiful gardens on this short walk near Sevenoaks. The gardens include bluebell woodland, rhododendrons and azaleas. There's also a walled garden with Himalayan-inspired grass-sculpted terraces and a large pond with fountains. You can enjoy a short climb to the little Everest viewpoint for wonderful views over the Weald of Kent. After your walk you can refresh yourself at the delightful Riverhill Cafe which offers a range of homemade and locally-sourced food and drink. The gardens are situated on the Greensand Way long distance walk so there is scope for extending your exercise. You could pick up the path and head north to the nearby Knole Park where you will find 500 resident deer, ancient woodland, dry heathland, acid grassland and wood pasture.",
