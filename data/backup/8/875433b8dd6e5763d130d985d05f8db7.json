  "description": "Enjoy stunning coastal views and delightful coastal villages on this walk on the Llyn Peninsula. There are also fine sandy beaches, interesting rock pools and great views to the mountains of Yr Eifl and Snowdonia to enjoy on this bracing walk. The walk starts from the car park at the little village of Morfa Nefyn. You then walk along the attractive headland to the fishing village of Porthdinllaen where you will find the well known Ty Coch Inn. The distinctive pub is considered one of the best in Wales with its wonderful views over the Irish Sea to The Rivals. You continue around the headland passing the lifeboat station and heading through the local golf course before returning to the car park. The area is wonderful for wildlife. Look out for a variety of sea birds including oystercatchers, sand martins and cormorants. Grey seals can also be seen around the coast. The area can also be reached on the Nefyn Walk which starts at the nearby town and heads along the beaches to the site.",
