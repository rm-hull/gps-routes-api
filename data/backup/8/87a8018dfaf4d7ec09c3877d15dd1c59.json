  "description": "This large Hampshire based village is a great place to start a walk. There's miles of woodland and heathland trails on the nearby Ludshott Common, Woolmer Forest and Bramshott Common. The village also has a train station so is easily accessible by public transport. This circular walk from the village explores the Foley Manor estate to the west of the settlement. You'll also visit Weavers Down on the edge of Woolmer Forest. The walk starts at the train station and heads west to explore the Foley Manor Estate. Here you'll find a number of pleasant woodland trails with pretty lakes and ponds. Just west of here there's mile of good trails across Weavers Down with attractive heathland and some fine views from the elevated spot. Around here you'll pick up a section of the Shipwrights Way, a shared walking and cycling trail running from the nearby Alice Holt Forest to Portsmouth along the imagined route a tree may have taken from forest to warship. Liphook dates back to Norman times and was for many years a coach stop on the route between London and the naval port of Portsmouth. You then follow part of the Sussex Border Path east to visit the large Folly Pond and Wheatsheaf Common before returning to the train station.",
