  "description": "This Leicestershire based village is located in a pleasant rural spot on the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal and the River Sence. This circular walk from the village takes you to the neighbouring village of Carlton before heading to the Ashby Canal for a pleasant waterside walk along the towpath. You can reach Carlton by following the Leicestershire Round south east for just under 2 miles. The long distance footpath passes right through Shackerstone and is a good way of exploring the surrounding countryside on a waymarked trail. From Carlton you can follow a country lane west to the canal at Carlton Bridge. This will takes you north past Congerstone to return to the village. The village includes a railway station on the Battlefield Line, a heritage railway running from Shackerstone via Market Bosworth to Shenton. The station includes an interesting museum, Victorian tea room souvenir shop, loco shed and main rolling stock. To continue your walking in the area head north east to Ibstock where you can explore the splendid Sence Valley Forest Park. There's miles of great cycling and walking trails with three lakes, meadows and peaceful woodland to explore.",

The authentic setting is a lovely way to step back in time while enjoying a fine range of cobs, pasties and delicious cakes. It's very quaint and includes a nostalgic railway museum. You can find them at postcode CV13 6NW for your sat navs. If you fancy a pub lunch then there's the Rising Sun. The pub is located near the canal and the station at postcode CV13 6NN. They have a family-friendly conservatory and an attractive garden for warmer days. There's also a car park and restaurant dining area. The pub is dog friendly."
