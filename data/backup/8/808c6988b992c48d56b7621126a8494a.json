  "description": "This little Kent based village has some nice waterside walks along the Conyer Creek and the Swale River. This circular walk from the village takes you east along the Saxon Shore Way and the Swale River to the Little Murston Nature Reserve near Sittingbourne. You can then return on country lanes and a section of the Swale Heritage Trail. The walk starts in the village and heads north west along the Conyer Creek to the Swale. You can then follow a waymarked footpath east to visit the Nature Reserve at Little Murston. There's a number of pretty pools and lots of wading wildlife to look out for here. The route then heads south to Tonger Corner and Cheke's Court where you pick up the Swale Heritage Trail. You can follow this long distance footpath east to Blacketts Cottages before returing to Conyer.",
