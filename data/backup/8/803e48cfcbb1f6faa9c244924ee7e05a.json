  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around the pretty Wardle reservoir in Greater Manchester. There's a car park at the southern end of the water on Ramsden Road where you can pick up the footpath around the water. The reservoir is surrounded by attractive moorland with great views across Manchester to the Cheshire plain. Watergrove is great for wildlife watching with birds such as Common Sandpiper and Curlew to look out for. There's also mammals such as Fox, Stoat and Weasel. In the summer there are lots of wildflowers such as Marsh Orchid, Birdsfoot Trefoil, Tormentil, Harebell and Sneezewort. These attract a wide variety of butterflies to the area. The Weighver's Way and the Pennine Bridleway run past the reservoir so you could pick up these long distance paths to extend your walk. If you head west you can climb to Brown Wardle Hill for more great views over the Pennines. The hills stands at 400m (1,312 ft) making it one of the highest points in Rochdale and Greater Manchester. Just beyond the hill is the town of Whitworth and Cowm Reservoir where there's another circular trail. Greenbooth Reservoir is also nearby and well worth a visit. If you head east from Watergrove Reservoir you can climb to Dobbin Hill and Stansfield Hill.",
