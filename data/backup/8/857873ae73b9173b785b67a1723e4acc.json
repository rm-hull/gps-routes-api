  "description": "Enjoy 1000 acres of landscaped parkland and forest at Staunton Country Park near Havant. Here you'll find a farm, two pretty lakes, a maze, a walled garden and glasshouses containing exotic tropical flowers and plants from around the world. There is also a visitor center, with animals and attractions and a number of interesting buildings including follies and a gothic library. There are a number of trails ideal for walking and cycling while cycle hire is available at the Victorian Coach House. The route below starts and ends at the car park but Rowland's castle train station is another good access point situated less than a mile from the park. The park includes the large woodland area of Havant Thicket which forms part of the Forest of Bere. You can extend your walking in the area by visiting Creech Woods near Denmead and West Walk. The Shipwrights Way long distance cycling and walking trail runs past the park. You can follow the trail all the way to Portsmouth via Havant and Hayling Island. Just to the east of Rowlands Castle you will find Stansted Park where you will find a fine 1800 acre park surrounding the Edwardian Stansted House.",

      "content": "The Rowlands Castle Walk starts from the train station in the nearby village. It heads to Stansted Park and Havant Thicket before making its way to the park. The route is a nice way of seeing all of these local attractions in one loop. The village is also worth exploring with its picturesque village green and remains of the old castle to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
