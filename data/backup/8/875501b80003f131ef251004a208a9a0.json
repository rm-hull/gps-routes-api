      "caption": "Footbridge over a stream in the wood. This footbridge crosses the stream which runs through Blakes Wood. Trees have been growing in the wood for 10.000 years, since the last ice age. The site has been managed by man for many centuries using the technique of coppicing - cutting trees to the ground and then allowing them to regrow in following years. Traditionally this process provided a regular supply of timber for fences and firewood, but is now recognised as also being beneficial for wildlife by encouraging woodland flowers and providing an ideal habitat for insects and birds."

  "description": "Enjoy a series of nice woodland trails in this pretty wood in Chelmsford . There's a car park on Riffhams Chase in Little Baddow. From here you can pick up the paths taking you through the woods and along Blake's stream. In the woods you will find oak, hornbeam and sweet chestnut trees with bluebells in the spring. Look out for birds including hawfinches and nightingales. It's easy to extend your walk by heading south to Lingwood Common and Danbury Common . Here you'll find cycling and walking trails with woodland, common, heath, wild flowers, streams and bogs. Danbury Country Park is also very close by.",
