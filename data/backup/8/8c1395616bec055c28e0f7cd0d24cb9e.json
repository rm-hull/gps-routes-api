  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Bardowie Loch just to the north of Glasgow. It's a very peaceful spot which is used for sailing with the Clyde Cruising Club Dinghy Section at the eastern end of the site. On the northern side of the loch you'll also find the 16th century Bardowie Castle, a category A listed building.",

      "content": "The Kelvin Walkway runs to the west of the site. You could pick this up and follow it north through Milngavie and visit the Milngavie Reservoirs and Dumbrock Loch in Mugdock Country Park. The epic West Highland Way also starts in Milngavie. You could pick up the waymarked trail and follow it north to Craigallian Loch and Carbeth Loch on the Milngavie to Drymen Walk. The pretty Loch Ardinning is located very close to the park too. The small loch is owned by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and is a great place for easy walks and wildlife spotting. Head south and you could visit Hogganfield Loch at the northern tip of Glasgow. To the north east you can pick up the Strathkelvin Railway Path near Strathblane. This shared cycling and walking route runs along a disused railway line from Gartcosh to Strathblane, with lovely views of the Campsie Fells on the way. To the north west there's the interesting Burncrooks Reservoir Walk which visits the unusual narrow rocky chasm at the Whangie before heading to the pretty reservoir. Near here there's also something of a hidden gem at the Devil's Pulpit in Finnich Glen. There's a wonderful deep sandstone gorge and rushing waterfall to see in this geologically fascinating area."
