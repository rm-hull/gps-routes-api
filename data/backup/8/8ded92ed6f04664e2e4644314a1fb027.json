  "description": "This Durham based village is located in a nice position on the River Tees just to the west of Piercebridge. Gainford includes a picturesque village green, some historic Georgian Houses, a mineral spa fountain and a pleasant riverside park. The village is located on the Teesdale Way, a long distance waymarked trail which runs from Dufton, in Cumbria, to Redcar on the North Yorkshire coast. This circular walk from the village heads west along the trail to visit Winston. You can start the walk at the Gainford Millennium Green, a small riverside park on the south western side of the settlement. Then head west along the tree lined path to the Gainford Spa, a hidden natural fountain with supposedly healing mineral water. It has a sulphur smell, but is apparently quite sweet to drink. The route continues west past the West Tees Bridge to Winston where there is another riverside park and the historic Winston Bridge. The single arched stone bridge dates back to the mid 18th century and includes a small replica Spitfire.  In July 1988, the bridge was used in the filming of the television serial Piece of Cake, where a Spitfire flew under the bridge piloted by Ray Hanna, a founding member of the RAF Red Arrows aerobatic display team. You can return to Gainford on the same path or cross the bridge and follow alternative tracks on the southern side of the river. To continue your walking in the area head east along the Teesdale trail to visit the ancient Piercebridge Roman Fort.",
