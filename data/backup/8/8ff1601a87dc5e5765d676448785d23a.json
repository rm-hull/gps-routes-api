  "description": "This short, easy cycling and walking trail runs along the western shoreline of the beautiful Coniston Water in the Lake District National Park. The route starts at the car park at Lake Road and runs through Coniston Hall Park to Hoathwaite Farm. It's perfect for beginners and families looking for a safe, waterside ride. Bikes can be hired from the Coniston Boating Centre. If you'd like to continue your outing you could head to the nearby Grizedale Forest where you will find miles of way-marked cycling and walking trails. You could also follow the Cumbria Way a couple of miles to the north east where you will find the beautiful Tarn Hows and the pretty Monk Coniston estate. For a longer walk try our 16 mile Circular Walk around Coniston which visits the tarns, fells and forest on both sides of the lake.",
