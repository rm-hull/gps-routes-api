  "description": "This hill near Porthmadog offers fine views over North Wales including the Llyn Peninsula, the Rhinogydd, Moelwynion, Moel Hebog, and Snowdon. This walk starts at the lovely harbour in Porthmadog and follows the coastal path south to Borth-Y-Gest. Here you can leave the coast and follow a footpath north west to the hill summit which stands at a height of 263 m (863 ft). It's a lovely spot with fine views back down to Porthmadog and the adjacent river estuary. As well as the great views you will also find a hillfort which shows some resemblance to the \"nuclear forts\" of the Early Middle Ages found in Scotland. After taking in the views the route descends back to Porthmadog on the same paths. For a longer route try our Circular Walk around Porthmadog which visits the lovely Black Rock Sands beach at Morfa Bychan before climbing to Moel y Gest.",
