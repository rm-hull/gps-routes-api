  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the pretty Chelmarsh Reservoir in the Severn Valley. On the way you'll enjoy views of the River Severn and visit the little village of Chelmarsh. The walk starts from Hampton Railway station on the Severn Valley Railway. You can catch the fine heritage steam trains from Bewdley or Bridgnorth. From the station it is a short walk to the reservoir using a section of the Jack Mytton Way long distance footpath. Follow the waymarked trail north and it will take you around the northern part of the reservoir and into Chelmarsh. The route then heads south through Chelmarsh Common to Sutton before heading along the southern part of the reservoir and returning to the train station. If you are looking for a longer route then you could try our Bridgnorth Walk which uses the Severn Way to visit the reservoir from the town.",
