  "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking in this large country park near Glasgow. There are 1350 acres to explore including wetland, burn, woodland, grassland and scrub. The main attractions in the park are the beautiful Barrhead Dams with miles of waterside trails alongside a series of connected reservoirs. These include the large Balgray Reservoir and the smaller Ryat Linn and Waulkmill Reservoirs. The dams are excellent for birdwatching - look out for lapwing, ringed plover, redshank, common sandpiper and common gull. The park is located a few miles south west of Glasgow city centre at Barrhead. If you wanted to extend your outing you could head to the nearby Rouken Glen Park where you will find miles of walking paths.",
