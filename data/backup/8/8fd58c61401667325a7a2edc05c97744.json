  "description": "Climb this\u00a0Iron Age hill fort and enjoy wonderful views across the Dorset countryside on this circular walk near Wimborne . The route starts at the car park on Blandford Road and takes you around Badbury Rings on good footpaths. The countryside surrounding the fort is very attractive with woodland, fields and nice views towards Kingston Lacy. You'll also pass the ancient woodland of the Oaks which was planted in the 14th century. The site has evidence of Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman occupation. It is named after the Iron Age hill fort with the three rings, which date from around 500 to 600 BC. If you would like to continue your walk then you could visit the nearby Kingston Lacy . Here you will find miles of walking trails through woodland and attractive parkland and gardens.",
