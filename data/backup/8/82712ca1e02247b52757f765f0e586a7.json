  "description": "Orrest Head was the first fell climbed by Alfred Wainwright. It inspired him to a 'to a life made happy by fellwandering' so you can expect some wonderful views over lakeland on this fairly easy climb. It's a great walk to do if you're coming in by train as the start of the climb is located right next to Windermere railway station. The walk involves some lovely woodland sections and fabulous views of Lake Windermere, the Old Man of Coniston, Scafell Pike, Great Gable, Fairfield and the Langdale Pikes. This circular walk begins across the main road from the train station. It climbs steadily to Orrest Head on good footpaths before descending to The Causeway Farm. You then turn south and head to High Hay Wood and Elleray Bank before returning to the start/finish point. To continue your walking in the area, head down the hill to the village of Bowness and try the climb to Brant Fell. It's a similar walk with more lovely views over the lake.",
