  "description": "This walk explores the photogenic ruins of the historic Jervaulx Abbey in North Yorkshire. The Grade I listed abbey dates from the 12th century but was later plundered and pillaged during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. Today the abbey and surrounding Jervaulx park make for a lovely peaceful stroll. There's 126 acres to explore with wildflowers, grazing sheep, a pretty pond and fine views of the surrounding North Yorkshire countryside. Afterwards you can enjoy some refreshments at the delightful on site tea rooms. You can start your walk from the car park area on the eastern side of the site. Then pick up the footpaths heading east around the park.",
