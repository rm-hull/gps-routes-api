  "description": "This walk explores the photogenic ruins of the historic Jervaulx Abbey in North Yorkshire. The Grade I listed abbey dates from the 12th century but was later plundered and pillaged during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. Today the abbey and surrounding Jervaulx park make for a lovely peaceful stroll. There's 126 acres to explore with wildflowers, grazing sheep, a pretty pond and fine views of the surrounding North Yorkshire countryside. Afterwards you can enjoy some refreshments at the delightful on site tea rooms. You can start your walk from the car park area on the eastern side of the site. Then pick up the footpaths heading east around the park.",

      "content": "To continue your historic walking in North Yorkshire head to Fountains Abbey and Rievaulx Abbey. There's more fine trails around the atmospheric ruins of these two sites. There's also Rosedale Abbey in the North York Moors although this was really just a small Cistercian nunnery, of which only a stone turret or belfry remains in the village churchyard. If you head north from the site you could visit Danby Hall and the pretty Thornton Steward Reservoir. There's also some nice waterside trails along the River Ure which runs just to the north of the ruins. The settlements of Leyburn, Bedale and Masham are also nearby as is the lovely Leighton Reservoir which lies just to the south. The long distance Six Dales Trail also passes through the area. A few miles to the north is the noteworthy village of Constable Burton where you can enjoy lovely trails around Constable Burton Hall. The grade-I-listed Georgian mansion includes some beautiful grounds with peaceful woodland, pretty becks and delightful gardens to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nidderdale Walks and the Yorkshire Dales Walks pages."
