  "description": "This village in Stirling is located in a lovely spot on the River Forth at the foot of Craigmore mountain in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. Described as The Gateway to the Trossachs it's a popular base for walkers wishing to explore the forestry and lochs of the area. This walk from the village explores the Achray Forest section of the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park. On the way you will pass some photogenic waterfalls before visiting the nearby Loch Venachar and Loch Drunkie. You can start the walk from the forest park visitor centre at David Marshall Lodge. From here head north east past the small lake and you will soon come to the secluded waterfalls. The trails continue north to take you past as Lochan to Loch Drunkie where there is a nice waterside trails. More forest trails then lead north to the much larger Loch Venachar. You can return the same way or follow alternative forest paths to turn it into a circular walk. The route uses a trail which is also suitable for cyclists. To continue your walking in the area head west to Loch Ard. Near the north-western shore there's more pretty waterfalls to see at the falls of Ledard.",
