  "description": "Explore the 430 acres of parkland and gardens surrounding this red-brick country house in East Clandon. The park is run by the National Trust who have devised some fine waymarked walking trails. One of these is the 'Long Walk', a circular walk of around 3 miles which takes you around the edge of the park through woodland and open parkland. There are also lovely views of the surrounding Surrey Hills. The walk starts at the car park and heads past the pretty sheepwash pond where you can look out for herons, terns and kingfishers. The route then passes woodland with honeysuckle, cherry blossoms and specimen pine trees. You continue past open fields with cattle and horses before another woodland section through Little Wix Wood. The final section involves a short climb to a viewpoint before returning to the house. The Long Walk is the one shown here but there are other shorter waymarked trails if you prefer. The easier Wix Wood walk is marked with blue markers and gives great views of the country house. The area is excellent for walkers so if you wanted to continue your walking you could head to the nearby Albury Park .",
