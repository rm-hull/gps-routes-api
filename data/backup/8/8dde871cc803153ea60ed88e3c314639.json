You can start your walk from the village and follow footpaths south west up to the reserve. In the reserve you can enjoy some fantastic limestone scenery with steep cliffs, caves, old quarries and views of the Nant Onneu river. There's a wide variety of interesting and rare plantlife and wildlife to see as well. Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of birds including ring ouzel, redstart, wood warbler and pied flycatcher on the walk. The elevated reserve also commands fine views over the Usk Valley and the surrounding Black Mountains from the high points.",
