  "description": "This walk takes you along the River Ribble from the Yorkshire town of Settle to its near neighbour at Stainforth. The riverside walk follows the route of the Ribble Way, a long distance waymarked footpath running through the area. The route runs along a fairly flat path for a distance of just under 4 miles. Along the way there's rushing weirs and lovely views over the surrounding Yorkshire countryside. The walk starts at the train station and heads west to cross the river at Penny Bridge. Here you can pick up the Ribble Way and follow the trail north towards Langcliffe and Stainforth. Here you can enjoy views of the photogenic Stainforth Force Waterfall before finshing in the village.",
