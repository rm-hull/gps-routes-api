  "description": "This 168 acre nature reserve has some nice woodland trails including a waymarked 1.6 mile walk. Interesting flora includes the rare Small-Leaved Lime and the pretty Deptford Pink wildflower. It's a lovely peaceful place for a stroll with the addition of some moderate hill climbs with great views over the area. Interestingly, the reserve was opened by Sir David Attenborough in 1986. The woods are located just to the north of Farningham and Eynsford. You can park at the car park at the end of Calfstock Lane, just off the A225. Please note cycling is not permitted in the woods. The Darent Valley Path runs close to the woods and through Farningham. You could follow it south and visit Eynsford Castle and Lullington Castle. Here you will find more nice footpaths in Lullingstone Country Park. If you follow it north then it will take you into Dartford, passing Darenth Country Park on the way. The park has nice wide lawns, picnic areas, meadows and pockets of woodland.",
