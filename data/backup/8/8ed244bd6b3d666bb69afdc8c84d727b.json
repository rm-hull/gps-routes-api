  "description": "This Yorkshire village is located in the Hambleton District, just west of the North York Moors. This circular walk takes you east to visit the neighbouring village of Thirlby and the lovely Gormire Lake. The route follows a mixture of public footpaths and country lanes to visit the ford at Ravensthorpe Mill and Southwoods Hall before coming to the lake. There's some peaceful woodland paths here and the option of extending the walk to visit the nearby Sutton Bank and the Kilburn White Horse. You can enjoy some wonderful views over the North York Moors from this popular local landmark. The Cleveland Way National Trail and the Hambleton Hills can also be accessed in this area.",
