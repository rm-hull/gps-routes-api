  "description": "A circular walk from the river Cartford Inn pub in Great and Little Eccleston, Lancashire. The fine inn is in a splendid location next to the River Wyre near the village of Great Eccleston. It was named pub of the year 2020 by Telegraph readers in the Sawday\u2019s Pub Awards. There is also a good sized car park here. This circular walk starts from the Cartford Inn and explores the countryside and river trails in the surrounding area. From the inn you can directly pick up the riverside path and follow it north east to Wyre Side Farm where you cross on the footbridge. The route then heads north along Hagg Lane to meet with the Wyre Way. You can follow this waymarked trail west past Ratten Row to Rawcliffe Hall where there's a caravan park. Turn south here and it will take you along Crow Lane to the river where you cross to the other side on the Toll Bridge next to the pub. Back at the pub you can tuck into some excellent food in the lovely garden area. Here you can enjoy views across the countryside and pay a visit to the adjacent art gallery where there are exhibitions and shows from local artists.",

The park is a lovely place for a stroll with lots of birdlife to look out for in the estuary. Just beyond it you will find the pretty area of Knott End where there are some fine coastal walks to try. Heading east on the Great Eccleston Walk will take you to St Michael's on Wyre and Churchtown where there is a picturesque church next to the river. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lancashire Walks page."
