  "description": "This walk explores the hills and lakes around the village of Rhigos in the Rhondda Cynon Taf. The walk starts from the excellent Rhigos Mountain Viewpoint car park. It's a beautiful spot with fine views over the Vale of Neath and the Cynon Valley. Head carefully west along the road and you will soon come to the Coed Morgannwg Way . You can follow this waymarked footpath west above the twin lakes of Llyn Fawr and Llyn Fach. There are great views down to these two pretty lakes and some nice woodland trails through the surrounding forest. The trail will take you to another local hill at Craig Y Llyn which stands at 600 metres. The summit is the highest point in the traditional county of Glamorgan (Morgannwg), and the South Wales Valleys.",
