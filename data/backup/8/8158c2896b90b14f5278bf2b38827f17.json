  "description": "This popular coastal walk crosses the famous rope bridge to visit Carrick-a-Rede Island on Northern Ireland's Causeway Coast. You can start the walk from the car park, just to the north east of Ballintoy. The path then heads east past the beautiful Larrybane Bay, with cliff top views as far as the Scottish Islands. There's also attractive countryside on the other side with lots of wildflowers to look out for on the summer months. The path then descends on a series of steep steps to the rope bridge below. It was built about 350 years ago and spans 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) across with a height of 30 metres (98\u00a0ft). The exciting crossing leads you onto the island where you can follow a path towards the northern end. There's also an old fisherman's cottage which is sometimes open to the public. After exploring the island following the same path back to the car park. The area is also great for wildlife with large number of seabirds and the possibility of spotting porpoises or dolphins in the sea below. Look out for guillemots, razorbills, kittiwakes and fulmars\u00a0as you make your way around the site. To continue your walking on the Causeway Coast head west and explore the magnificent Giant's Causeway . There's some incredible geological rock formations and more great coastal views to enjoy here. The Portballintrae to Ballintoy Coastal Walk is a popular route along this section of the coast. Near here there's also the noteworthy Mussenden Temple . The National Trust owned estate includes the ruins of the historic Downhill House and the wonderfully positioned 18th century cliff top temple. From here there are more outstanding views over the Inishowen Peninsula to enjoy.",
