  "description": "Climb Penshaw Hill and visit this iconic Sunderland landmark on this short walk in Tyne and Wear. It's a popular spot with the impressive monument sitting in an elevated position with wonderful views over the surrounding countryside. You can park at the foot of the monument and follow the footpath up the hill to the high point. After taking in the views you can then explore the woodland trails in Penshaw wood where there are pretty bluebells, white ramsons and wood anemones in the spring. The 70 foot high monument was built in 1846 and commemorates the 1st Earl of Durham. It appears on the badge of Sunderland Football Club and can be see for miles around. To extend your walk you can visit the nearby Herrington Country Park. It's just to the south of the hill and includes cycling and walking trails with a boating lake, a nature pond and a sculpture trail. The Great North Forest Heritage Trail crosses Penshaw Hill so you could also continue along this long distance trail. Head north and you can join the Weardale Way for a stroll along the River Wear. The riverside trail will take you to Chester-le-Street in one direction and to Sunderland Harbour in the other.",
