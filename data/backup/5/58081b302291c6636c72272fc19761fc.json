  "description": "This North Yorkshire village is located near Earby and Skipton on the Pennine Way. With its historic pub and choice of footpaths its a nice place to explore this attractive part of the Yorkshire Dales. This walk from the village follows a section of the Pennine Way north to climb to the viewpoint at Pinhaw Beacon. It's about a 1.5 mile walk from the village to the hill top, following the waymarked trail in a north westerly direction. Along the way you will pass through pretty heather moorland before coming to the 388 metre high trig point at the summit. Here you can enjoy some splendid views over the surrounding countryside and hills of the Yorkshire Dales. If you would like to extend the walk you could head a little further north to visit the pretty Elslack Reservoir .",
