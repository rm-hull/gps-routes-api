There are some hills in the park which you can climb for some wonderful views over the surrounding dales countryside and the city of Bradford. You can extend the walk by heading south west and picking up the Bronte Way. The long distance trails could be used to link up with the Calderdale Way to explore the Shibden Valley and the popular Shibden Park near Halifax .",
