    "description": "This park, also known as Ninesprings Country Park , is situated in Yeovil, near the town centre. You will see rivers, lakes, waterfalls, open grassland, woodland and a children's play area as you pass through the 127 acres of the park. There are splendid views of the Dorset Hills and an abundance of wildlife with water voles, kingfishers, green woodpeckers and otters visitors to the park. The route below is devised for walkers but there is also a flat linear cyclepath which follows the line of the old railway and links the different areas of the country park. The Monarch's Way passes the eastern edge of the park. You could pick up the waymarked trail to further extend your walking around the Yeovil area. One nice idea is to follow it south towards the lovely Sutton Bingham Reservoir where there's nice waterside trails to try. Ham Hill Country Park is also nearby and offers fine views of the Mendip Hills, Blackdown Hills, Quantock Hills and Dorset Downs from the elevated viewpoint.",
