  "description": "This park, also known as Ninesprings Country Park, is situated in Yeovil, near the town centre. You will see rivers, lakes, waterfalls, open grassland, woodland and a children's play area as you pass through the 127 acres of the park. There are splendid views of the Dorset Hills and an abundance of wildlife with water voles, kingfishers, green woodpeckers and otters visitors to the park. The route below is devised for walkers but there is also a flat linear cyclepath which follows the line of the old railway and links the different areas of the country park. The Monarch's Way passes the eastern edge of the park. You could pick up the waymarked trail to further extend your walking around the Yeovil area. One nice idea is to follow it south towards the lovely Sutton Bingham Reservoir where there's nice waterside trails to try. Ham Hill Country Park is also nearby and offers fine views of the Mendip Hills, Blackdown Hills, Quantock Hills and Dorset Downs from the elevated viewpoint.",

      "content": "We recommend continuing your walking in the Yeovil area in the historic village of East Coker. It's located just a short distance to the south east of the town and features the noteworthy Coker Court. The historic building includes a noble hall complete with minstrel gallery and magnificent Jacobean fireplace. Within the churchyard lie the remains of the poet T.S. Eliot who once wrote a poem about East Coker. There's also the interesting church of St Michael, which was believed to have been built by Hugh de Courteney in 1276. The church is in an interesting location, situated on a hill overlooking the village. There's also the excellent Heylar Arms to visit. It's a pub of some note, being a Grade II listed building and dating from the 15th Century. The pub still retains a wealth of character and charm, set in the picturesque village of East Coker with its mellow stone and thatch cottages, almshouses, Historic Coker Court and St Michael\u2019s church. There's an excellent menu, real log fires, a large sunny garden to sit in during the summer months and a car park that can accommodate over 30 cars. The inn also provides accommodation if you need to stay over. You can find the pub in the village on Moor Street with a postcode of BA22 9JR for your sat navs."
