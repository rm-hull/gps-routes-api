This is looking north-west with the setting sun having about 10 minutes to go on the western horizon. The water meadows here means that the actual source will vary depending on the amount of rainfall we have had. There is a culvert under the road (to the right) which becomes the actual river."

  "description": "The Hampshire town of Alton is nicely positioned on the northern edge of the South Downs National Park. Several waymarked walking trails pass the town providing the opportunity to explore the surrounding area on well maintained footpaths. The town is also close to the popular Alice Holt Forest This circular walk from the town takes you up onto the Downs where you can enjoy some fine country views. The walk starts at the Source of the River Wey, just to the west of the town centre and train station. Head east along the river and it will take you past Alton Public Gardens where there's a bandstand, cafe and some nice footpaths. In the centre of town you then pick up the Hangers Way and follow the waymarked path past King's Pond before heading out into the countryside on Neatham Down. The path continues past Monk Wood and Clay's Farm before coming to the village of East Worldham. The route continues south east past King John's Hill before coming to Binswood. Here you leave the trail to turn west through Pheasant Wood towards West Worldham. You then follow the Water Lane track back into the town.",

Here you'll find Selborne Common where there's miles of nice woodland trails to try. The expansive Alice Holt Forest is also nearby. The popular forest has several cycling and walking trails to explore. Chawton Park Wood is another popular place for walkers. The neighbouring village of Chawton is also well worth a visit.
