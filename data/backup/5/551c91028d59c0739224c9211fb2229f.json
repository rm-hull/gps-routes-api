The unusual limestone rock formation stands above a disused quarry in Leckhampton. There's more great views and photo opportunities here making it a worthy addition to your outing. Just to the south of the park you can visit the little village of Birdlip and try the circular Birdlip Walk. This will take you to the nearby Witcombe Reservoirs, the interesting Great Witcombe Roman Villa and then up to the fine viewpoint at Barrow Wake.
