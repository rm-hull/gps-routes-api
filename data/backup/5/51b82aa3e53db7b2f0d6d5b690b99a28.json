  "description": "This circular walk takes you from the car park at Woodhenge to the world famous Stonehenge. It's about a 2.5 mile walk to the site on a series of fairly flat footpaths. On the way you'll pass other interesting historical sites with fine views across Salisbury Plain . The walk starts from the Woodhenge car park, located between Amesbury and Durrington. Just to the north of here you can visit Durrington Walls . Here you'll find the largest complete henge in Great Britain at over 4500 years old. Just to the west of the car park you'll find the fascinating Woodhenge. The timber circle monument dates from the Neolithic period with pottery found from that period after an excavation in 1926. Construction of the timber monument was probably earlier, but the ditch has been dated to between 2470 and 2000 BC, which would be about the same time as the construction of the stone circle at Stonehenge. From the henge you head west and then south past Old King Barrows before passing along The Avenue to reach Stonehenge . The Avenue is a 1.5 mile long bank and ditch earthwork thought to be the ceremonial route and entrance to the stone circle. You can then explore the Stonehenge site itself for a fee payable to English Heritage. From the stones you head north to visit the Stonehenge Cursus. This large Neolithic cursus monument was constructed several hundred years before the earliest phase of Stonehenge in 3000 BC. You can explore this area for free before following footpaths east back to the car park.",
