This is the weir that impounds water at the tunnel level, and passes it through control valves in the structure in the right of the image. Compensation water issues from a pipe low in the wall of the weir, and floods will pass straight over the wide crest. At times of low flow, there is hardly any water to be seen, but recent rain has filled the basin to crest level."

  "description": "This walk explores the area around the village of Dolgarrog in Conwy County Borough on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park. You'll visit the impressive Dolgarrog Pipeline and the picturesque Coedty Reservoir on the route. From the elevated position of the pipeline there are excellent views to the surrounding hills and mountains. The village is also notable as the site of the Dam disaster of 1925 wher the failure of two dams caused a flood that swamped the village, killing 16 people. The walk starts in the village and then follows woodland west, passing the old locomotive shed of the Cowlyd Tramway. The route then circles Pennarda where there's the remains of a medieval township. At the western end of the walk you skirt the edges of Moel Eilio before coming out at the pretty Coedty Reservoir. The final section heads past Pont Newydd before returning you to Dolgarrog. To extend the walk head west to visit Llyn Eigiau where you can see the breached dam wall which lead to the disaster. There's a lovely waterside trail here with old slate quarries to explore and the possibility of spotting Carneddau ponies on the hills.",

From the summit of the hills there are excellent views over the River Conwy Valley to the Carneddau mountains. Head further east to the nearby village of Llanfair Talhaiarn and you could explore the lovely River Elwy Valley and enjoy a climb to the splendid viewpoint at Mynydd Bodran. The historic Bodelwyddan Castle is also near here and well worth a visit. Just to the north is the delightful village of Rowen. The village is considered one of the prettiest villages in Wales and a real hidden gem. The climb to Tal Y Fan, in the Carneddau mountains, is often started from here."
