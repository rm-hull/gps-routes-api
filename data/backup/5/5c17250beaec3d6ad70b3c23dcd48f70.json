  "description": "This large park in Bexleyheath has some nice footpaths to try. It's a pretty spot on the outskirts of the city with a small pocket of woodland, acres of grassland and an attractive lake. Additionally there are a number of well laid out gardens with fountains and a variety of plants and flowers. You can enjoy a stroll around the English Garden, the Rock Garden at the western end of the park, and the Peace Garden. The park also include the 18th century Danson House. You can tour parts of the Grade I listed Palladian villa at certain times. There are grand rooms on the principal floor as well as the Victorian basement kitchen equipped with historic kitchen items. The park is in a good spot for extending your walk to other local nature reserves, woods and parks. The London Loop runs just to the south to Foots Cray Meadows, the River Cray, Petts Wood and Scadbury Park . The expansive Joydens Wood also lies within walking distance of Bexley train station.",

It follows the London Loop to Footscray Meadows before heading to Joyden's Wood and the splendid Hall Place where there's a historic house surrounded by beautiful gardens. The 7 mile route is a good way to see some of the highlights of the Bexley area."
