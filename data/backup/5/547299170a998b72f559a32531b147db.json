  "description": "Follow the Knightley Way from Badby to Greens Norton on this pleasant walk through Northamptonshire. The walk begins in Badby and heads through Badby Woods towards Fawsley Park and Fawsley Hall . This 15th century Hall and Landscape Park was created by the Knightley family and is now a hotel and restaurant. It's a very pretty section with lots of bluebells to see in Badby Wood and a series of pretty lakes in Fawsley Hall Park. After leaving Fawlsey Hall the path then continues through the countryside through Preston Capes and Farthingstone to Greens Norton. The route links with the long distance Nene Way in Badby. There's also the option of taking a small detour from the route around Farthingstone to visit the Everdon Stubbs Nature Reserve.",
