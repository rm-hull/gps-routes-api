  "description": "This walk climbs to the Iron Age hill fort which spans Midsummer Hill in the Malvern Hills AONB. The route runs for just over a mile and includes a moderate climb. On the way there's some nice woodland trails with lots of pretty bluebells to look out for in the spring. After the short climb you will be rewarded with fine views over Worcestershire and Herefordshire. The route starts from the parking area at Hollybush, off the A438, just to the south of the hill. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north through woodland toward Hollybush Hill. The hill lies just to the east of Midsummer Hill and is the site of an Iron Age hill fort which spans both hills. The hillfort is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is owned by Natural England. The site is considered unusual in that the ramparts enclose two hills and the intervening valley. It was built around 390 BC and it's thought that the settlement was occupied by 1500 people until it was destroyed by fire in AD 48. Midsummer Hill stands at a height of 284 m (932 ft) and commands fine views over the surrounding countryside. Most of the lovely Eastnor Deer Park is visible including the notable obelisk. After exploring the site the route picks up a section of the Worcestershire Way long distance trail to descend back to the car park. To extend the walk you can continue north along the Worcestershire Way to the nearby Herefordshire Beacon and British Camp .",
