  "description": "This circular walk explores the woods, riverside paths and countryside around the Lancashire village of Euxton. The village is located just to the west of Chorley and south of Leyland. You can reach the village from Liverpool and Preston via the West Coast Main Line at Euxton Balshaw Lane railway station. This walk starts from the station and first heads north west to Euxton Millennium Green (there is a car park here if you would prefer to start off at the green). You then follow footpaths west towards Glead Hill and Dawber's Lane before turning south to meet up with the River Yarrow. The trail then heads east along the river, passing a picturesque weir and an old mill before coming to Pincock Bridge. From here you turn north to arrive back at the train station. If you would like to extend the walk you could head just a mile east to visit Astley Park. There's some lovely trails around the estate surrounding the historic Astley Hall.",
