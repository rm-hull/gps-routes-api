  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk through the delightful grounds surrounding this moated manor house near Warwick . In the grounds you will find woodland trails, a lake and a walled garden with flower borders and fruit trees. The walk then continues into the adjacent Hay Wood where there are miles of peaceful woodland trails and pretty bluebells to enjoy. The house itself has a delightful courtyard, with yew trees, lawns and brick paths. Inside you can explore the Tudor Kitchen, the 16th century Great Hall\u00a0and the library. Both the Grand Union Canal Walk and the Stratford Upon Avon Canal run past the estate so there is scope for continuing your walk along one of these waterways. Also nearby is the lovely Packwood House . This is another National Trust owned property with parkland and gardens to explore. There's a pretty lake, herbaceous borders, wildflower meadows, splendid topiary and a beautiful orchard. Our Lapworth Circular Canal Walk visits both Packwood and Baddesley Clinton with nice waterside stretches along the two canals.",
