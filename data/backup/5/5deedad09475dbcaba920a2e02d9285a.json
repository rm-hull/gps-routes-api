It is a 17th-century courtyard castle, extended from a 16th-century keep, which has now been demolished.\nThe property was sold by the family in 1668, to John Graham of Claverhouse, also known as Bonnie Dundee or Bloody Cavers - depending on whose side you were on. He led the Jacobites to victory at Killiecrankie in 1689, though died in the process.\nThe castle was later converted to use as a woollen mill, then a barracks. It was restored in 1989, and is now a part of the University of Abertay."

Normally it is possible to see across the river to Fife. On this June morning cold air had crept from the sea into the river mouth (not an uncommon event especially in summer when sea haar spoils many a fine day in Dundee) and only a tiny fragment of Fife is visible above it."

Shortly after this was taken, the haar hit the city itself. (Note that the Overgate Centre seems to be missing- you can see right through to the church tower and Nethergate- so I'm guessing this between the old one being demolished and the new one being built, as the crane would suggest)."
