  "description": "The expansive Loch Goil is located within the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park on the Cowal peninsula in Argyll and Bute. It is an arm of Loch Long. This walk starts from the head of the loch at the village of Lochgoilhead and takes you up to Donich Water along the Cowal Way. Here you can enjoy a series of rushing waterfalls and some wonderful views back down to the loch. You can extend the walk by continuing east along the Cowal Way to visit Loch Long and Arrochar .",
