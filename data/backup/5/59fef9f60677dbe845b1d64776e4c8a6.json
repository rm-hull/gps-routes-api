  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Ullock Pike for some fine views over Bassenthwaite Lake. Start the walk from the Dodd Wood car park on the south eastern side of the lake. From here you can pick up woodland trails heading north east towards the Ravenstone Hotel. Here you pick up the Allerdale Ramble and follow the waymarked trail south towards Ullock Pike. At the 690 metre summit you will find a cairn and fine views to Bassenthwaite Lake, Derwent Water and many of the surrounding fells. The trail then heads south east along Longside Edge to Carl Side where there is a small tarn. This is a fine ridge walk with excellent views in all directions. At Carl Side the route turns south west to lead you back down to Dodd Wood where a final woodland section takes you back to the car park.",
