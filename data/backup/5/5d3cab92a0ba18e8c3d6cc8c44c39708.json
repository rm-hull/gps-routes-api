  "description": "This fine circular walk around Hastings visits the coast and countryside to the east of the town. The route runs for about 6 miles with some moderate climbs along the way. It's a varied walk with woodland trails, hill climbs and coastal sections to enjoy. The walk starts at the harbour in Hastings and heads east along the Saxon Shore Way long distance footpath. The trail takes you along the coast to Hastings Country Park. Here you'll find 600 acres of parkland and woodland to explore on a number of paths. Features in the park include sandstone cliffs, shady glens covered with gorse and trees, nature trails and picnic areas. It's also great for wildlife with Peregrines, black redstarts and fulmars to look out for. After passing through the park you continue along Covehurst Bay before turning north toward Fairlight. You then turn west through farmland where you pick up a section of the 1066 Country Walk to take you past Ecclesbourne Reservoir and High Wickham. At Ecclesbourne Glen you can visit the waterfalls and interesting rock formations. The final section descends past East Hill back to the sea front and the finish point of the walk. To extend your walking in the area you could continue east along the coast path to Fairlight Cove and Winchelsea on the Hastings to Winchelsea Coastal Walk. You could also head north through the High Weald on the 1066 Country Walk. The path will take you to Friar's Hill and Guestling Wood where there's wood anemone and bluebell displays in spring.",
