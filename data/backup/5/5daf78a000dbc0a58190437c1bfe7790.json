  "description": "This village in Carmarthenshire is the gateway to the expansive Brechfa Forest where you can enjoy miles of waymarked walking and mountain bike trails. There's also lovely riverside paths and a historic abbey to see in the area. This walk from the village takes you through the River Cothi Valley. You start on Pont Gorlech which crosses the river in Abergorlech. From here you can pick up a footpath heading south east along the river to Pen Y Ddinas Quarry. On the way you will pass through a scenic wooded valley with countryside views and lots of wildlife to look out for. The walk can be extended by heading south to visit the ancient Talley Abbey and the pretty Talley Lakes.",
