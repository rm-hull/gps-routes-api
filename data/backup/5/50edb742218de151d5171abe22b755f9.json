    "description": "These woods south of Wadebridge are a popular place for mountain bikes with several black MTB trails to try. You can pick up the trails just to the west of the River Camel on the Grogley Road. There's some good downhill lines on a number of red and black MTB trails. You can continue your exercise to the east of the woods by picking up the Camel Trail . It's an easy cycle and walking trail running along the river to Wadebridge or Bodmin. Scroll down for a great video showing the trails on an e bike.",
