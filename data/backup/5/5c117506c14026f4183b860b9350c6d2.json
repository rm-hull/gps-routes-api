  "description": "This little hamlet in North Staffordshire is in a fine spot for exploring the south western corner of the Peak District National Park. It's a pretty place with views of the River Churnet, a picturesque weir and an old mill with a working water wheel. The settlement sits just to the south of two of the local highlights at Hen Cloud and The Roaches . This walk from Upper Hulme takes you up to these two notable hills where you can enjoy some fabulous views over the area. It's also great for wildlife with Wallaby to look out for on the Roaches, and the successful annual breeding of peregrine falcons. To continue your walking in the area head just over a mile south west to visit Tittesworth Reservoir where you can enjoy a pleasant waterside walk along the water. Scroll down for a list of other walks in and around Upper Hulme.",
