  "description": "This little hamlet in North Staffordshire is in a fine spot for exploring the south western corner of the Peak District National Park. It's a pretty place with views of the River Churnet, a picturesque weir and an old mill with a working water wheel. The settlement sits just to the south of two of the local highlights at Hen Cloud and The Roaches. This walk from Upper Hulme takes you up to these two notable hills where you can enjoy some fabulous views over the area. It's also great for wildlife with Wallaby to look out for on the Roaches, and the successful annual breeding of peregrine falcons. To continue your walking in the area head just over a mile south west to visit Tittesworth Reservoir where you can enjoy a pleasant waterside walk along the water. Scroll down for a list of other walks in and around Upper Hulme.",

      "content": "After your exercise you can enjoy some well earned refreshment at Ye Olde Rock Inn. The historic pub dates back over 200 years while the original part of the building dates back further and is believed to have been constructed in the late 17th Century. It was originally used as a house for the Mill Manager, responsible for the production of textiles in the working part of the village in the valley below. The pub serves a fine Sunday lunch and also have pool room to the rear of the pub. The inn is dog friendly too."
