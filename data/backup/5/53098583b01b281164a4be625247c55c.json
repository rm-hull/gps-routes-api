    "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along the River Allen and through a beautiful wooded gorge on this easy walk in the North Pennines AONB. The area is managed by the National Trust so the paths are well maintained and waymarked. The walk starts at the National Trust car park and heads south along the western side of the river to Plankey Mill. You'll pass Raven Crag and a pretty waterfall on the way. At Plankey Mill you cross to the other side the river and return on the eastern side, passing Morralee Woods as you go. The area is a nature reserve so there is an abundance of wildlife on the walk. Look out for dipper, grey wagtail, kingfisher, heron, roe deer and otter. The area is located near Bardon Mill, Hexham . Bardon Mill train station is just over a mile from start point for the walk. You can easily follow the River South Tyne from the station to Allen Banks.",
