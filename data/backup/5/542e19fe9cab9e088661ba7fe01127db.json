  "description": "This small Oxfordshire village is located near Kidlington and Bicester in the Cherwell district of Oxfordshire. The village is on the Oxfordshire Way long distance footpath. This 10 mile circular walk from the village uses part of the trail to visit Kirtlington, the Oxford Canal, Shipton on Cherwell and Bletchingdon. On the way there's some lovely views of the Oxfordshire countryside to enjoy. The route starts in Weston On The Green and follows the waymarked Oxfordshire Way footpath north west to visit the neighbouring village of Kirtlington where you can visit the Kirtlington Quarry Nature Reserve. To the west of the village you can also enjoy a pleasant waterside stroll along the Oxford Canal Walk and the River Cherwell. Follow the towpath south and it will take you to Shipton on Cherwell where you leave the canal and river to head east. Country trails will take you east to Bletchingdon where you will pass Bletchingdon Park, a Grade II* listed Palladian country house dating from 1782. From here you can follow a pleasant country lane back to Weston On The Green.",
