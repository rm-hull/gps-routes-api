Boats dropped through Carrington's lock to join the river before being pulled across the top of the weir and back into the canal via a flood lock on the other side. The Uttoxeter Canal opened in 1811 but was never profitable. It was closed in 1849, when much of its route was filled in to accommodate North Staffordshire Railway."

    "description": "This route uses a section of the Churnet Valley Railway Path and the Staffordshire Way to create a circular walk around the Staffordshire based village. On the way you'll pass Alton Towers, the peaceful woods at Dimmingsdale and enjoy views of the River Churnet. The walk starts at Denstone Hall and follows the old railway line north along the river towards Crumpwood Weir. The trail continues west past the Alton Towers Theme Park before passing Mather's Wood and arriving at Oakamoor. The trail then heads south to Dimmingsdale where there are some nice woodland trails and a series of picturesque ponds. Continue south east and you will pass through the village of Alton before picking up Saltersford Lane and following it back towards Denstone.",
