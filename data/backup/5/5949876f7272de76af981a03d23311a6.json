Boats dropped through Carrington's lock to join the river before being pulled across the top of the weir and back into the canal via a flood lock on the other side. The Uttoxeter Canal opened in 1811 but was never profitable. It was closed in 1849, when much of its route was filled in to accommodate North Staffordshire Railway."

  "description": "This route uses a section of the Churnet Valley Railway Path and the Staffordshire Way to create a circular walk around the Staffordshire based village. On the way you'll pass Alton Towers, the peaceful woods at Dimmingsdale and enjoy views of the River Churnet. The walk starts at Denstone Hall and follows the old railway line north along the river towards Crumpwood Weir. The trail continues west past the Alton Towers Theme Park before passing Mather's Wood and arriving at Oakamoor. The trail then heads south to Dimmingsdale where there are some nice woodland trails and a series of picturesque ponds. Continue south east and you will pass through the village of Alton before picking up Saltersford Lane and following it back towards Denstone.",

      "content": "For an alternative walk in the valley try the Churnet Valley Walk which runs from Froghall to Cheddleton where you will find the Churnet Valley Railway centre. There's lots of information on the railway and an interesting museum here. If you follow the Staffordshire Way south from the village you can visit the Rocester Roman Fort and the town of Uttoxeter. Heading north east will take you to the weir at Norbury and the village of Ellastone. Here you'll find a 16th century church, the site of a 12th century ruined abbey and fine old inn dating from the 1850s. Just a couple of miles south west of Denstone you will find the remains of the 12th century Croxden Abbey. There are nice trails to follow around the substantial abbey ruins with information boards detailing the history of the site. It's an interesting area and run by English Heritage with no charge for your visit. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
