    "description": "This walk visits the pretty Thurlbear Wood nature reserve near Taunton in Somerset. There's 40 acres to explore here with peaceful woodland trails, views of the surrounding countryside, ancient forest, wildflowers and lots of wildlife to see. In particular keep your eyes peeled for a variety of butterflies during the summer months. The site is located just a few miles south east of Taunton, near to the village of Stoke St Mary. The Staple Fitzpaine Herepath passes the site. You could pick up this circular trail to explore the surrounding Blackdown Hills AONB . Follow the trail round to the south and it will take you to the ancient earthworks at Castle Neroche .",
