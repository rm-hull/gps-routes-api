  "description": "This walk follows the Carrowteige Beach Loop Walk in County Mayo. The circular trail runs for about 6.5km and takes you to the picturesque cove at Carrowteige Beach. On the way there's some fabulous views of the rugged cliffs, Broadhaven Bay and the Atlantic Ocean in this beautiful remote part or Ireland. The lonely Planet walking Guide described it as \u201cThe finest sustained coastal walk with a profusion of cliffs, crags, caves, chasms and islands along the remote North Mayo Coast\u201d. There are three other waymarked loop walks in the area with more details on the link below. The popular trails are more challenging and longer than this one. For example you could head north to Portacloy Beach and pick up the Portacloy Loop Cliff Walk .",

The challenging long distance hike exposes you to the remote and mountainous scenery of the Wild Nephin National Park. To the south west there's the Erris Head Loop Walk to try. The popular circular walk explores a wonderful coastal headland with lots of seabirds and fabulous views. Head east along the coast and you could visit the noteworthy Ceide Fields. The fascinating archaeological site includes the oldest known stone-walled fields in the world, dating back nearly 6,000 years."
