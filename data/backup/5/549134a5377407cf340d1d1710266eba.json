  "description": "This circular walk takes you to the lovely Goit Stock Waterfall near Cullingworth in West Yorkshire. The falls are something of a hidden gem, located in the secluded Goit Stock Wood on the edge of the South Pennines. The walk starts just to the south of Harden at a parking area by Harden Lane and Mill Hill Top. From here you can pick up footpaths heading east through Goit Stock Woods. There's pretty streams and rushing falls in this delightful little grotto. To extend the walk just follow the path south from the woods to the Hewenden Reservoir and Viaduct . The impressive structure is worth climbing as there are fine views over the area from its elevated position. The circular Harden Beck Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the falls before heading to the reservoir. A little further on is Doe Park Reservoir so there is good scope for continuing your waterside walking in this lovely area. The reservoir is home to Doe Park Water Activities Centre where you can try a variety of water based activities. You could also head in the other direction and continue north east along the Harden Beck into Harden village.",
