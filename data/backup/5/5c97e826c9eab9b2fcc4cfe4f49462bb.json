  "description": "This Wiltshire based village is in a nice location for exploring the woodland and countryside of the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The historic settlement includes a pretty village pond, a 13th century church, the Grade II listed King John's House and some beautiful local pleasure gardens. This walk from the village visits the lovely Larmer Tree Gardens, just to the south of the settlement. The beautiful gardens include some nice walkways with tea rooms, peacocks and a folly viewpoint to enjoy. The walk then continues south to visit the neighbouring Dorset village of Farnham where there are many quaint thatched cottages to see.",

To the north east there's Chase Woods to explore. Please note dogs are not allowed inside Larmer Gardens but there are public footpaths around the grounds. The King John mentioned above is dog friendly."

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area pick up the Wessex Ridgeway and follow it north to Win Green Hill. The hill is the high point in the Cranborne Chase AONB and provides excellent views to Shaftesbury, Salisbury Plain, Glastonbury Tor, the Mendips, the Quantocks, the Purbecks and the south coast. Just to the west of the hill you will find Fontmell and Melbury Downs nature reserve where there's fine views and interesting flora and fauna. To the south you will find the Dorset Cursus an ancient Neolithic earthwork on Wyke Down. There's some excellent views over the countryside of the Cranborne Chase AONB to enjoy from here.
