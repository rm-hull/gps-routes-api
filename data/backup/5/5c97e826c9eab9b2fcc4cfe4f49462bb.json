    "description": "This Wiltshire based village is in a nice location for exploring the woodland and countryside of the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The historic settlement includes a pretty village pond, a 13th century church, the Grade II listed King John's House and some beautiful local pleasure gardens. This walk from the village visits the lovely Larmer Tree Gardens , just to the south of the settlement. The beautiful gardens include some nice walkways with tea rooms, peacocks and a folly viewpoint to enjoy. The walk then continues south to visit the neighbouring Dorset village of Farnham where there are many quaint thatched cottages to see.",
