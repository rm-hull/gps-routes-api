  "description": "This popular circular walk visits Lough Avalla in the Burren National Park in County Clare. The trail runs for about 7km and is easily identified by standing stone slabs and takes you on a captivating journey. It winds through the historic site of an ancient Celtic farm and briefly follows the picturesque shoreline of Lough Avalla. Along the route, you'll traverse sandy roadways, well-trodden farm tracks, charming laneways, and open expanses of the unique Burren landscape. The trail offers a diverse experience, with highlights including an uphill climb to a stone cairn, a stretch of rugged cliffs, and a variety of terrains encompassing stone-laden fields, patches of scrubland, and lush pastures. Throughout your hike, you'll be treated to breathtaking vistas, especially when gazing upon the impressive Mullaghmore peak in the distance. It's a rewarding journey that combines natural beauty, historical resonance, and a touch of adventure."
