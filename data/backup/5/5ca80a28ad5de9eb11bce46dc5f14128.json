  "description": "This walk climbs High Wheeldon Hill in the Upper Dove Valley area of the Peak District. It's a popular walk with the hill summit giving wonderful views over the Peak District. You can see Parkhouse Hill, Chrome Hill and the villages of Earl Sterndale, Longnor and Crowdecote . The walk starts from the little village of Earl Sterndale near Buxton . The village is a popular start point for walks because of its proximity to Dovedale, Parkhouse Hill and Chrome Hill . There's a nice old pub called the Quiet Woman where you can find refreshments at the end of your walk. From the village you head east along a nice country lane to Wheeldon Trees Farm where you begin your ascent of the hill. The view from the top is one of the best of the Upper Dove Valley with Axe Edge Moor also visible. The walk then returns to Earl Sterndale the same way. You could also hike to the hill on our Longnor Walk which also visits the River Manifold, the River Dove and Crowdecote.",
