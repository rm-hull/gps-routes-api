  "description": "This walk climbs High Wheeldon Hill in the Upper Dove Valley area of the Peak District. It's a popular walk with the hill summit giving wonderful views over the Peak District. You can see Parkhouse Hill, Chrome Hill and the villages of Earl Sterndale, Longnor and Crowdecote. The walk starts from the little village of Earl Sterndale near Buxton. The village is a popular start point for walks because of its proximity to Dovedale, Parkhouse Hill and Chrome Hill. There's a nice old pub called the Quiet Woman where you can find refreshments at the end of your walk. From the village you head east along a nice country lane to Wheeldon Trees Farm where you begin your ascent of the hill. The view from the top is one of the best of the Upper Dove Valley with Axe Edge Moor also visible. The walk then returns to Earl Sterndale the same way. You could also hike to the hill on our Longnor Walk which also visits the River Manifold, the River Dove and Crowdecote.",

      "content": "In Earl Sterndale you could head to the Quiet Woman for some post walk refreshments. It's in a picturesque location opposite the church and village green. There's a fine interior with a low-beamed room with a real fire to warm yourself next to in the winter months. Outside there's a pub garden to relax in on warmer days. You can find the pub at a postcode of SK17 0BU. The pub has an interesting history as it is reputed to be over 400 years old and was in the occupation of the Heathcote family for over 300 years. The name is unusual with only two others in the country.  Pictured above, the Quiet Woman in Earl Sterndale. In nearby Crowdecote there's the noteworthy Packhorse Inn. The inn dates back to the 16th century when it served as a stop off point from the packhorse trail from Newcastle Under Lyme to Hassop, near Bakewell. There's a charming old interior and a garden area with fine views of the valley."

      "content": "The circular walk from Hurdlow visits the hill. The little hamlet lies just to the east and has a good sized public car park and a charming country pub to relax in afterwards. The High Peak Trail can also be picked up here. The shared cycling and walking trail runs along an old railway line from Cromford to Dowlow. Just to the north there's Chelmorton, an interesting settlement which makes a fine start point for exploring the area. The village includes an ancient 11th century church and a fine 18th century pub too. For more walking ideas in the area see the Derbyshire Walks and the Peak District Walks pages."
