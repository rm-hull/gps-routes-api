A grand house has stood at Hardwick since Medieval times, but it was only in 1748 that John Burdon, a wealthy Tyneside businessman bought the estate that an extensive programme of building and landscaping was initiated. The Hall is now a Hotel\u00a0whilst the southern part of the park is a country park managed by Durham County Council. This photo shows the meadows and an old avenue of trees in the eastern part of the Park on what was probably an old carriage drive between Sedgefield village and the Hall. The Sedgefield By-pass runs in front of the trees in the distance, with the gates to the Hotel beyond."
