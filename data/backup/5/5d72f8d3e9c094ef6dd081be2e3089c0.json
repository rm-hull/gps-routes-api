  "description": "This walk runs from Lincoln to Sleaford through a number of historical villages and beautiful countryside in the North Kesteven area. The name refers to the Spires of the churches and to the rural sport of Steeple chasing. You will pass a series of interesting villages including Heighington, Nocton, Metheringham, Scopwick, Digby and Ruskington. The scenery on the walk includes flat fens and heath, while there are also two lovely waterside sections along the River Whitham at the start and the River Slea into Sleaford at the end of the walk.",
