  "description": "This pretty reservoir near Colchester has a nice country lane running along its northern side. You can reach the reservoir from the nearby village of Ardleigh by following Wick Lane and Lodge Lane for about a mile. The path runs right along the lake with nice views across the water to the trees lining its the edge. The lake is located just to the east of High Woods Country Park where there's woodland, open spaces, ponds, a lake and wildflower meadows. You could also try our walk around Colchester and visit the castle, the River Colne and several historic sites.",
