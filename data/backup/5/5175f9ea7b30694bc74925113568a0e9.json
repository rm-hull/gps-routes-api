The line was eventually closed in 1976."

  "description": "Travel through the fabulous North Pennines and enjoy some spectaular scenery on this shared walking and cycle path. The trail starts off at Tyne Head - the source of the River South Tyne. You then head north to Garrigill along the river passing the impressive Ashgill Force waterfall as you go. The trail continues to Alston where you will run alongside the fabulous South Tynedale Steam Railway (see video). From Alston you head through Slaggyford and Lambley where you will pass the Grade I listed Featherstone Castle and the striking structure that is Lambley Viaduct. The final section takes you through Coanwood to the finish point at Haltwhistle rail station. This is a terrific riverside trail with moors, fells and beautiful countryside to take in. The route links with Isaac's Tea Trail and the Pennine Way around Alston.",
