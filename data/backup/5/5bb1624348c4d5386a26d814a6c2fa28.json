  "description": "This area of ancient woodland near Newark on Trent has some nice footpaths taking you around the forest. In the woods you will find large Victorian era-planted\u00a0Rhododendrons and other interesting flora and fauna.\nThere is a car park off Coddington Lane where you can pick up the circular surfaced walking trail. It runs for just under a mile and is a nice way to spend half an hour. To extend your walking in the area you could head a couple of miles west and pick up the Trent Valley Way . The lovely riverside trail runs through Newark-on-Trent and Collingham. The woods are close to the villages of Coddington and Beckingham which are nice places to go for refreshments after your walk.",
