  "description": "Enjoy an easy walk along this pretty reservoir and wood in the Washburn valley. You can start the walk from the nearby village of Leathley and follow a footpath along the River Washburn to the reservoir. The path takes you along the eastern side of the water with some peaceful woodland trails to enjoy in the adjacent Lindley Wood. Here you will find pretty bluebells in the spring and the rushing waters of Greystone Beck. It's a lovely area with the reservoir surrounded by attractive woodland and the option of continuing your walk along the Washburn to Norwood Bottom. If you enjoy this walk then you could visit Swinsty Reservoir and Fewston Reservoir. These are located a couple of miles north of Lindley Wood in the Nidderdale AONB. Just to the south is the splendid Otley Chevin Country Park where you will find woodland, heathland, meadowland and rocky outcrops with marvellous views. Lindley Wood is located close to Otley and not far from Leeds. In the town you could try our Otley River Walk which take you through some of the riverside parks and nature reserves located on the River Wharfe.",
