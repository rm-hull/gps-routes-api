It was built in the 1670s and 1680s, and was named after King Charles II. It remained in use as a British Army barracks until the end of British rule in southern Ireland, before being abandoned after it was partially destroyed by the retreating anti-Treaty forces during the Irish Civil War in 1922. This is a view taken from the massive gun turret in the south-east corner."

The fort was occupied by James II's forces in 1689 and recaptured by William of Orange's Dutch troops in October 1689. The recognised weakness with the fort was the landward side where it is overlooked by higher ground. The garrison surrendered once the outer wall had been breached by artillery fire."

  "description": "This popular walk visits a historic coastal fort in Summer Cove,\u00a0County Cork. The 17th century Bastion fort sits in a splendid location on Kinsale\u00a0harbour and is a designated National Monument of Ireland. You can start your walk from the car park and then follow good footpaths around the site visiting the various fortifications and the Charles Fort Lighthouse. On the way there are some splendid sea views and an interesting museum where you can learn all about the history of the fort. At the end of the walk you can enjoy some refreshments in the on site tea rooms. Just to the west of the site there's another hugely popular walk to try at the Old Head of Kinsale . The loop walk explores a fabulous coastal headland with spectacular views and a visit to the memorial to the crew of the\u00a0RMS\u00a0Lusitania.",
