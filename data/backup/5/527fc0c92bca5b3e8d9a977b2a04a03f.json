  "description": "This large area of common land in Berkshire covers 350 hectares (860 acres). It consists of heathland and broadleaved woodland of oak, ash and beech. There are miles of public footpaths and bridleways suitable for cycling. Other features include 12 ponds, several greens and a variety of flora and fauna. Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of woodland birds and the occasional deer as you make your way through the woods. You can start off from the car park which is located about half way between the villages of Upper Buckleberry and Chapel Row. The common is located just to the north of Thatcham so if you would like to continue your walking in the area you could head to the excellent Thatcham Discovery Centre. You could also head north to the village of Bucklebury and then continue to Stanford Dingley by picking up the riverside footpath along the River Pang .",
