  "description": "This circular walk around the village of Snowshill makes use of the Cotswold Way long distance footpath to explore the surrounding countryside. The village is delightful with typical Cotswold cottages surrounded by lovely rolling hills. It also contains the wonderful Snowshill Manor , owned by the National Trust. This 16th century manor house contains an extensive collection of various objects collated by the architect and poet Charles Paget Wade. These include 26 suits of Japanese samurai armour, bicycles, toys and musical instruments. You can also stroll around the delightful gardens with pretty terraces and ponds. This 3.5 mile walk takes you into the wider countryside around the village, visiting Littleworth Wood and Buckland Wood on the way. If you would like to extend your walk you could continue along the Cotswold Way to the nearby village of Broadway and visit the splendid Broadway Tower Country Park .",
