Near Kincraig there's Loch Insh which includes a watersports centre and an old lochside church. Just west of Aviemore there's the wonderful Craigellachie Nature Reserve. The reserve includes a series of lochans, fascinating plantlife and a wonderful viewpoint towards the nearby Cairn Gorm. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
