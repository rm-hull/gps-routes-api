  "description": "This circular walk explores the riverside Fishermans Walk in Beddgelert, Snowdonia. On the challenging route you will visit the Sygun Copper Mine and the beautiful Llyn Dinas before climbing into the surrounding mountains. You will also pass the little hamlet of Nantmor at the southern end of the route. Start the walk in the village where you can pick up a section of the Cambrian Way and follow it north east to the copper mine and the lake. Here you turn south to climb towards Grib Ddu and Cwm Bychan enjoying some wonderful views of the surrounding mountains on the way. The walk then takes you through the stunning scenery of the Aberglaslyn Pass, following the River Glaslyn north to return to the village. Here you will pass along the Fisherman's Path, a rocky path right next to the rushing river where great care should be taken. This final section passes the legendary Gelert's Grave and the ancient church which are well worth a visit if you have time.",
