  "description": "This pleasant canalside village is a nice place to start a walk. There's an impressive pub and hotel thatched 'village' here, with a surfaced towpath and views of the River Brock too. This walk takes you from the village of Bilsborrow to Garstang along a pleasant section of the Lancaster Canal. On the way there's old stone bridges, pretty locks and birds such as heron, ducks and geese to see. The walk starts from the car park at Owd Nells and Guys Thatched Hamlet. This canalside complex includes a fine pub with outdoor seating and an ice cream parlour. From here follow the towpath north and it will take you towards the Brock Aqueduct and Catterall with the hills of the Forest of Bowland making a splendid backdrop. The route continues through Bonds and into Garstang where you can finish in a pleasant riverside park by the River Wye.",
