Gold Lake was originally a natural lake that was extended in the 1930s, and there are now another four lakes and a stock pond in the group. The fishery was stocked in the early 1990s and the fish allowed to breed for several seasons before fishing started. The result is that catches are very good, as the pair of herons that patrol the lakes no doubt appreciate."

    "description": "This Hampshire town sits in the north east corner of the county in the Rushmoor area. There's good walking opportunities along the canal and river which run through the town. There's also expansive areas of woodland to the west and a number of pretty parks and lakes on the fringes on the town. This waterside walk around the town takes you along the Blackwater River and the Basingstoke Canal which run through the area. It's nice easy walking on flat footpaths with a visit to a local nature reserve and a lakeside park to enjoy as well. The walk starts at the car park at the Rowhill Nature Reserve just to the south west of the town centre and the train station. In the 55 acre reserve you will find the source of the Blackwater River and deciduous woodland. In the spring months you can see lots of pretty bluebells. From here you can pick up the Blackwater Valley Footpath and follow the waymarked footpath east along the river in Weybourne to the pretty Badshot Lea Big Pond. You continue east past Pea Bridge and Badshot Lea before turning north at Aldershot Park. The trail then runs along the eastern fringes of the town before coming to Gold Valley Lakes and the Lakeside Nature Reserve . There's a pretty lakeside park and reserve here with lots of water loving birds to look out for. In the park you can pick up the Basingstoke Canal and follow it west towards Wharf Bridge and the Queen's Parade Recreation Ground. You can follow the same paths back to the reserve or continue west into the Forest of Eversley and return on various woodland trails to create a circular walk.",
