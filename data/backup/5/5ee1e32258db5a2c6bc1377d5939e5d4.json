  "description": "This circular walk around Market Weighton makes use of the Yorkshire Wolds Way to take you on a tour of the countryside, woodland, lakes and parkland surrounding the East Riding town. The waymarked long distance trail will take you north to the lovely Londesborough Park where there's pretty streams, pockets of woodland and two small lakes. After exploring the park and the village you turn south to follow the eastern branch of the trail to the little village of Goodmanham. You then pick up a section of the Hudson Way to take you back into Market Weighton. You can extend your walking in the area by enjoying a waterside walk along the Market Weighton Canal to the Humber Estuary.",
