  "description": "This circular walk around Market Weighton makes use of the Yorkshire Wolds Way to take you on a tour of the countryside, woodland, lakes and parkland surrounding the East Riding town. The waymarked long distance trail will take you north to the lovely Londesborough Park where there's pretty streams, pockets of woodland and two small lakes. After exploring the park and the village you turn south to follow the eastern branch of the trail to the little village of Goodmanham. You then pick up a section of the Hudson Way to take you back into Market Weighton. You can extend your walking in the area by enjoying a waterside walk along the Market Weighton Canal to the Humber Estuary.",

      "content": "Just to the north east of the town you'll find the village of Goodmanham where you can enjoy a circular trail around the attractive Goodmanham Wold. You can follow the waymarked Hudson Way to the wold from the town. The shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line and the pretty Mill Beck. To the south there's nice trails around North Cave Wetlands, South Cave, the historic Hotham Hall Estate, Brantingham and the lovely Welton Dale. Head a couple of miles south from the town and you'll find North Cliffe Woods. The bluebell woods are a pleasant place for a peaceful stroll with lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. Just a couple of miles west of the town you can pick up the Bubwith Rail Trail. This flat, easy path will take you along an old railway line toward Holme-on-Spalding-Moor and the village of Bubwith. For more walks in the area see the Yorkshire Wolds Walks page."
