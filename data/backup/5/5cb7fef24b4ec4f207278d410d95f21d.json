In the 1930s a rock garden was created behind the coach house and, more recently, flower borders were added around the Castle and in the kitchen garden."

  "description": "This walk explores the grounds of Craigievar Castle in Aberdeenshire. The historic site is run by National Trust for Scotland and includes a photogenic fairytale castle, dating to the late 16th century. The striking pink coloured structure is thought to have been the inspiration for Walt Disney\u2019s Cinderella Castle. Craigievar includes some pleasant woodland walking trails where you can enjoy a stroll along the lovely beech avenue and look out for pine martens. From the attractive castle grounds you can also admire some splendid views of the Grampian Mountains. To continue your walking in the area head a few miles north east to visit Pitfichie Forest . Here you can visit the ancient Whitehills Stone Circle and explore the peaceful woodland trails at Bogmore Wood.",
