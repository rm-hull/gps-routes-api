  "description": "This walk visits St Chads Water Local Nature Reserve and Church Wilne Reservoir in Draycott in the Erewash district of Derbyshire. The walk starts from the car park at St Chads Water where you will find a pleasant circular footpath around the lake. There's also woodland edges and a wildflower meadow with lots of wildlife to see. Next to the lake is the historic St Chad's church which dates back to the 13th century. After exploring the reserve head north east along the Coffin Walk and it will lead you to Orchid Wood where there's some pleasant woodland trails ideal for dog walking. Near here you can also visit Church Wilne Reservoir near Breaston. The Midshires Way passes the reserve. You could pick this up and follow it south to visit the Trent and Mersey Canal where there are more easy, waterside walks to try. On the way you can also enjoy views of the River Derwent around Great Wilne.",
