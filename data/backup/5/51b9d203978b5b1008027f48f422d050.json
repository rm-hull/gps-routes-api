  "description": "This walk climbs to Brown Clee Hill from the village of Burwarton. The circular route runs for about 6 miles with woodland trails, tarns and fine views from the high points. The walk starts in Burwarton just to the east of the hill. From the village you can follow public footpaths west through Burwarton Park. On the way you'll pass pockets of woodland and the pretty Boyne Water. Just after passing the little lake you turn north west and link up with the Shropshire Way. Continue north along the waymarked path and it will take you toward Brown Clee Hill. Another public footpath branches off to the north east to take you up to the 540 metres (1,770 ft) summit of the hill where there is a Wireless Station and the Abdon Burf toposcope. This details some of the landmarks that you can see from this splendid, elevated position. You can take in far ranging views over the Shropshire Hills and into Wales from here. After taking in the views the route then descends to the east through Stanbroughs Wood. You then turn south to follow a bridleway back into Burwarton.",
