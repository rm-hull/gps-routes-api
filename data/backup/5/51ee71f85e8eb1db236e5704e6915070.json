Designed by Coplestone Warre Bampfylde, best known for creating the landscape gardens at Hestercombe House, it was divided into different apartments for justice, amusement, and pleasure. The ground floor housed the Guildhall, where magistrates would hear cases weekly, while the first floor featured a superb assembly room with a music gallery, two elegant large glass chandeliers, and a full-length portrait of George III. From 1772 and throughout much of the 19th century, the Market House served as one of the county\u2019s principal public meeting places. After the market relocated in 1929 and the arcades were removed in 1934, replaced by the wings now housing the Visitor Centre, the building's public role declined. However, with recent improvements, it is hoped this building can once again become the heart of the town. In front of the Market House, at the centre of the roundabout, stands the Burma Memorial, dedicated to the fallen of Prince Albert\u2019s Somersetshire Light Infantry."

The castle was the scene of the \u201cBloody Assize\u201d in 1685, when Judge Jeffreys tried over 500 supporters of the failed Monmouth Rebellion. The building also served as a prison, and in 1707, it hosted the last trial in the southwest of someone accused of witchcraft."
