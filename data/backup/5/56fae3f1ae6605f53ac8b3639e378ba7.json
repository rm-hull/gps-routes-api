  "description": "The historic county town of Dorset has some fine river trails, expansive local woodlands and a noteworthy hill fort to explore. This walk from the town takes you to some of the highlights of the area including the River Frome Watermeadows, Puddletown Forest, Thorncombe Woods and Hardy's Cottage. The walk starts at Dorchester South train station and heads east through the town to the River Frome. Here you follow a footpath across the water meadows to the village of Stinsford. In the village there's Kingston Maurward house where there's lovely gardens and a lake with a statue of excalibur. You head east past the lake towards Lower Bockhampton before turning north to the Stinsford Manor House and Higher Bockhampton. Here you can follow woodland trails around Thorncombe Wood and the adjacent Puddletown Forest. In this are you'll also find the National Trust Hardy's Birthplace Visitor Centre. The centre contains interesting displays about the life and works of author Thomas Hardy and his connection to the local landscape. You can then explore the cottage itself where Hardy was born in 1840. The delightful cob and thatch cottage is where he wrote some of his classic novels including 'Under the Greenwood Tree' and 'Far from the Madding Crowd'. After exploring the the cottage and surrounding forest area the route returns to Dorchester on the same paths.",
