  "description": "Travel from Derbyshire into Greater Manchester on this waterside walk along the Peak Forest Canal. The route runs from Buxworth in Derbyshire to Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester. On the way you'll pass a series of pretty locks with nice views of the surrounding countryside. It's about a 15 mile walk from end to end. You start off in the village of Buxworth at the restored Bugsworth Basin which was used to to carry limestone to the canal in the 18th and 19th centuries using the Peak Forest Tramway Trail. You could also start from the nearby Whaley Bridge Basin if you prefer. The first section then heads north towards Bridgemont and New Mills with views of the River Goyt. Around New Mills you can visit the splendid Torrs Riverside Park and Millennium Way. Here you will find a beautiful river gorge with a fabulous 160 metre long walkway elevated over the water. Soon after New Mills you come to Disley where you can take a small detour and visit the wonderful Lyme Park. The expansive deer park has great views of the surrounding Peak District Hills. The canal continues north through Marple where you will come to the impressive Marple Aqueduct and a flight of sixteen locks. It's one of the highlights on the walk and a nice spot to stop for some refreshments. The next stage runs through Romiley and Hyde before finishing at Ashton-under-Lyne where it links with the Ashton Canal. The canal also links with other long distance trails. You can pick up the Goyt Way at New Mills and enjoy another waterside walk along the riverside path. At the Buxworth end the canal links with the Peak Forest Tramway Trail which was used to carry limestone to the Peak Forest Canal in the 18th and 19th centuries. There's also the Cheshire Ring Canal Walk which visits five other canals and the lovely Tame Valley Way .",
