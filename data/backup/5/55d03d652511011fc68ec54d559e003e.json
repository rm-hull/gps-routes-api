Vendace, one of Britain's rarest fresh water fish, which dates back to the Ice Age, are to be found in this loch. The blue-green fish was introduced to the loch in the nineties and it now has more vendace per hectare than its only remaining native site in Britain at Derwent Water in the Lake District."

  "description": "This walk takes you to the wonderful Grey Mare's Tail waterfall and then on to Loch Skeen, in the Moffat hills section of the Southern Uplands of Scotland. The area is run by the National Trust for Scotland so there are very good paths taking you through the nature reserve. The walk starts at the Grey Mare's Tail car park near to the ranger's trailer where you can pick up information leaflets and have a look at a Peregrine Falcon's nest on a CCTV link. You then climb to the waterfall viewpoint, passing the gorge of the Tail Burn on the way. The falls are a spectacular sight, being the fifth highest in Britain and dropping 60m (200ft) into a gorge. The path continues along the Tail Burn to Hog's Well and Loch Skeen. Located at over 500m above sea level, the loch is the highest natural loch in the Southern Uplands. Overlooking the tranquil waters of the loch is the 821m high White Coomb hill. It's a truly beautfiul spot and well worth the extra climb from the waterfall viewpoint. The area is also excellent for wildlife. Look out for peregrine falcons, osprey, mountain hare and wild goats. If you would like to continue your walking in the area you could pick up the Southern Upland Way which runs a few miles to the south of the waterfall.",
