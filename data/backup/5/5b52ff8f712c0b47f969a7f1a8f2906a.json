  "description": "Follow the River Taff, from Cardiff to Brecon, on this fantastic waterside cycling and walking route. You start on the River Taff in Cardiff and head along the river northwards passing the Millennium Stadium and Cardiff Castle. There are also views of the attractive riverside Bute Park and the Weir on the Taff near Maindy as you leave the centre of Cardiff. You soon come to Radyr where you will pass the splendid Forest Farm Country Park and Castle Coch (the red castle) before passing through the village of Nantgarw. The route continues along the river through Glyntaff and on to Pontypridd where you join the trackbed of a disused railway to Merthyr Tydfil. The final section runs from Merthyr to Brecon passing the beautiful Pontsticill, Pentwyn and Talybont Reservoirs. You'll also pass the beautiful Blaen y Glyn Waterfalls before joining the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal taking you into Brecon. There are splendid views of the Brecon Beacon mountains as you approach Brecon. The trail is waymarked with a black and yellow disc.",

The pub dates from the 19th century and includes a small outdoor seating area for warmer weather. They can be found on Ynysangharad Road with a postcode of CF37 4DA for your sat navs. The pub is also dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."

      "content": "In Cardiff there's the popular Cardiff Bay Trail to try. This circular walking and cycling route explores the redeveloped Cardiff Bay with its marinas, shops, cafes and historic buildings. Just to the west of Pontypridd there's Barry Sidings Country Park at Trehafod. There's some popular woodland mountain bike trails and lovely walks along the park's streams and waterfalls. There's also good views of the River Rhonnda at the northern end of the park. The park makes a nice small detour from the route and has a good bike centre with hire and trail information. At the end of the route in Brecon you can enjoy a climb to the ancient Iron Age Hillfort and viewpoint at Pen y Crug, just to the north of the town. For more walking and cycling ideas in the area see the Brecon Beacons Cycle Routes and the Brecon Beacons Walks pages."
