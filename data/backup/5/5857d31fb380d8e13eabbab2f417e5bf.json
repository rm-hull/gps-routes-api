    "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking trails around these three pretty reservoirs near Chesterfield. Cyclists can enjoy a good track running around the middle and lower reservoirs while walkers can follow the same trails plus another around the upper reservoir. The trails are a mixture of lovely waterside paths plus some woodland trails through Linacre Woods. Look out for nuthatches, flycatchers and woodpeckers in the woods and kingfishers and mandarin ducks on the water. The circular route below starts at the car park and follows the shared cycle and walk trail around the middle and lower reservoirs. Linacre Reservoirs is located just a few miles west of Chesterfield city centre.",
