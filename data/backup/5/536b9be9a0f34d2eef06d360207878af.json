  "description": "Follow the River Itchen from its mouth at Woolston to its source near Hinton Ampner on this beautiful waterside walk. You start near Woolston station near Southampton Docks and head north through Southampton to a lovely riverside park near Swaythling and the Itchen Valley Country Park . The path continues past Southampton Airport and through Eastleigh before arriving at Winchester with its impressive cathedral. Here you can take a small detour to climb the lovely St Catherine's Hill and enjoy fine views over the town below, the River Itchen and the surrounding countryside of the South Downs. From Winchester you then turn east towards Itchen Abbas and New Alresford with the final section passing through Cheriton and finishing at National Trust owned Hinton Ampner .",
