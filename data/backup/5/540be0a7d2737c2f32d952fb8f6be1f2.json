The cliff edge here is difficult to reach, uneven and very dangerous."

  "description": "This walk on the Isle of Skye visits Kilt Rock and the waterfalls at Loch Mealt on the eastern coast of the island. You can start the walk from the car parking area on the eastern side of the loch. From here it is a short stroll to the Kilt Rock viewpoint and the waterfall. It's a lovely photogenic spot with the added opportunity of spotting a variety of coastal birds on the imposing cliffs. To continue your walking in the area head south along the coast to visit another island highlight at the spectacular Old Man of Storr. Just to the west is the climb to the Quiraing where there are wonderful views over the island.",
