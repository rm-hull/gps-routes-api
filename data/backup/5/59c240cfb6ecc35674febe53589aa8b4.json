  "description": "Follow the lovely footpath along the River Otter from Budleigh Salterton to the village of Otterton on this easy walk in East Devon. The walk starts on the seafront in Budleigh Salterton before heading east to the River Otter and the Otter Estuary . The lovely estuary consists of a variety of habitats including salt marsh, reed beds, low-lying meadows and pastureland. It's also a nature reserve and a great place for bird watching. Look out for birds including cormorant, redshank, common sandpiper and curlew. You then follow the river path north for about 2 miles to Otterton. It's an attractive little village with a green, thatched cottages and a pretty stream running through it. The historic mill is in a lovely location by the river and is open to visitors for free. Here you can experience the ancient traditions of flour milling and bread baking stretching back hundreds of years. There's also a bakery, cafe-restaurant, local food shop, gift and craft shop and an art gallery to see. After exploring the mill the route then heads south along the eastern side of the river, using a shared cycle and walking path. After passing Otterton Park and The Warren, you cross the river and return to Budleigh Salterton. You can extend your walking in the area by heading a mile east of Otterton to visit Ladram Bay . Here you will find a pair of striking\u00a0sandstone sea stacks in a lovely bay with a small beach. Just to the west of the village is Woodbury Common . The expansive common includes miles of walking trails with heathland, gorse, heather and pebblebeds from rivers which once flowed across the basin. If you follow the coast path west from Budleigh Salterton it will take you towards Exmouth and Orcombe Point . The spot marks the western end of the Jurassic coast and includes the Geoneedle sculpture which was constructed from a sample of each of the different rock types which can be found along the Jurassic coast.",
