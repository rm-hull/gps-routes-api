  "description": "Nantwich is located in Cheshire, next to two branches of the Shropshire Union Canal. It's an attractive market town with one of the county's largest collections of historic buildings. Before heading to the canal you can admire the fine Tudor and Georgian architecture. There is also the Grade I listed St Mary Church which dates from the 14th century. This circular walk takes you along the main branch of the Shropshire Union Canal and the Llangollen Branch, which runs a little further to the west of the town. It first heads towards Audlem on the main branch before cutting across the countryside to meet up with the Llangollen Branch. Start the walk about half a mile west of the town centre. This area includes the Nantwich Canal Centre where you'll find the historic marina and boatyard. There's also the lovely canal basin, some fine wooden sculptures and good facilities with a cafe, toilets and a shop. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it south towards Baddington and Hankelow. At Austin's Bridge you leave the canal and pick up the South Cheshire Way . Follow the waymarked trail west through the countryside towards Broomhall Green, Aston and Wrenbury . Here you pick up the Llangollen Branch and follow it north to Hurleston where you pass a small reservoir. You also pick up the main branch again here and follow it south back into Nantwich, passing Acton and Burford on the way.",
