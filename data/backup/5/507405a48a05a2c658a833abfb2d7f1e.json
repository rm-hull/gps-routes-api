  "description": "This circular walk in the Norfolk Broads visits the lovely village of Ranworth and its adjacent broad. Start the walk in the village where there is a public car park. From here you can pick up footpaths heading east along Malthouse Broad before turning south to visit South Walsham Broad. A track runs along the northern side of the broad before you turn north and then west along Priory Road. Country Lanes then head north to take you up to Ranworth Broad Boardwalk. You can follow the boardwalk up to the broad where you'll find the Wildlife Centre. There's lots of information on the huge variety of birdlife you can see on the water here. Species include great crested grebes, wigeons, gadwalls, kingfishers and cormorants. There are also areas of woodland and reedbeds at the reserve. After enjoying the broad the route then returns to the village car park. As you pass through the village pay a visit to the noteworthy Church of St Mary, known as the Cathedral of the Broads. You can climb the tower of the 16th century church for excellent views over the area.",
