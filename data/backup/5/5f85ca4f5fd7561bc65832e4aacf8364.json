    "description": "This challenging walk climbs Moel Hebog from Beddgelert in the Snowdonia National Park. There's great views of the Welsh coastline and several peaks including Snowdon, Moel Siabod and the Nantlle Ridge . Please note that while this is a great walk the path is not always well defined and there is a degree of scrambling involved. The walk starts from the picturesque village of Beddgelert with its fine bridge crossing the River Colwyn and a number of good pubs for refreshment. You then follow footpaths out of the village and through a woodland section before ascending the mountain path. At the 783 m (2,569 ft) summit you will find a trig point where you can enjoy some stunning views of the surrounding peaks. The walk can be extended by continuing to the peaks of Moel yr Ogof and Moel Lefn . The area is great for wildlife spotting. Look out for Buzzards, Red Kites and Perigrine Falcons as you make your way up the mountain. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could follow the Fishermans Walk along the stunning Aberglaslyn Pass . You could also visit the nearby Beddgelert Forest where you'll find miles of walking paths and mountain bike trails. The Lon Gwyrfai multi user path skirts the eastern edge of the forest. The trail runs between Rhyd Ddu and Beddgelert along a nice easy surfaced path.",
