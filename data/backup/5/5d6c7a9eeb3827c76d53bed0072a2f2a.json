  "description": "This route follows the Miners Track to the summit of the highest mountain in Wales. It is a slightly longer route than the alternative Pyg Track but has the advantage of waterside sections alongside the mountain's three beautiful lakes of Llyn Teyrn, Llyn Llydaw and Glaslyn. The walk begins in the Pen y Pass car park and ascends to the pretty Llyn Teyrn before coming to the much larger Llyn Llydaw. The path crosses the lake and then runs right along it's northern edge, making for a lovely waterside section. At the lake you'll also pass the ruins of the old Britannia Copper Mine crushing mill. You continue along a steep section to Llyn Glaslyn and then Bwlch Glas where you can see the tracks of the Snowdon Mountain Railway. The final section takes you from Bwlch Glas to the Snowdon summit where there are magnificent views over Snowdonia, Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Peak District and the Lake District. The Pyg Track starts from the same car park. It is a shorter route but has more challenging rocky sections. For an exhilarating circular ridge walk, taking in the Crib Goch ridge, try the Snowdon Horseshoe .",
