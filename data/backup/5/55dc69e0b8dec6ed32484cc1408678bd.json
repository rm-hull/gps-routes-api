  "description": "This circular walk visits the stunning Three Cliffs Bay on the Gower Peninsula before exploring the adjacent woodland of Nicholaston Burrows. It's an exceptionally beautiful area with the view over Three Cliffs Bay nominated for 'Britain's Best View' in a recent television programme. The area includes sand dunes, salt marsh and the signature three limestone cliffs. The lovely stream of Pennard Pill also flows into the middle of the bay. You can continue your walk along the cliff top to the pretty Nicholaston Burrows where you will find woodland trails and interesting flora such as bloody cranesbill, pyramidal orchids and a number of lichen species. This circular walk starts in the little village of Penmaen and descends to Penmaen Burrows where you will find the remains of a Neolithic burial chamber and a medieval church. You then head west to Nicholaston Burrows, passing the Nicholaston Pill stream and enjoying great views over Oxwich Bay. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Gower Way long distance walk or climb the sandstone ridge of Cefn Bryn for magnificent views over the area. The Pennard Castle Walk will take you to the nearby ruins of a 12th century grade II listed building and scheduled ancient monument with a fascinating history stretching back several centuries.",
