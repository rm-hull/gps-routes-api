  "description": "A lovely circular walk around the Cotswolds town of Marshfield. There's beautiful rolling countryside, waterside paths along the pretty Broadmead Brook and a visit to the little hamlet of West Kington to enjoy. Starting in the town centre you pick up a public footpath to take you across fields to Down Road, a quiet country lane which you can follow all the way to West Kington. It's a delightful little hamlet with picture postcard cottages and gardens. From here you pick up a footpath along the Broadmead Brook, heading west through a lovely valley full of wildlife and pretty wildflowers. The route then turns south along Shire Hill Lane before picking up more country paths to take you back into the town. The town is located just to the south east of Dyrham Park. The 270 acre deer park has miles of trails taking you to beautifully laid out park and gardens. The Cotswold Way runs past the park so you could pick up the long distance trail to further explore the area.",
