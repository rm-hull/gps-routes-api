  "description": "Explore the grounds of this 19th century Gothic Revival house and enjoy a walk along the splendid Highcliffe coast and cliffs. The castle is surrounded by attractive wide lawns and beautiful formal gardens. There are also nice woodland trails along the cliff top and a zig-zag path down to the beach. There's great views from the high points along the south coast towards Christchurch Bay and the Isle of Wight. The walk also visits the Steamer Point Nature Reserve just to the west of the castle. The reserve has some nice woodland trails and a variety of flora and fauna to look out for. Just to the east of the castle you'll find Chewton Bunny Nature Reserve. The wooded Chine has a trail leading to a pretty waterfall. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Bournemouth Coast Path. If you head west you'll come to Christchurch and the delightful Stanpit Marsh Nature Reserve. Also nearby is Hengistbury Head and Mudeford with its lovely beaches and fabulous coastal views. Heading east along the coast path takes you to Barton-on-Sea and Milford on Sea where you can explore the wonderful Keyhaven Marshes .",
