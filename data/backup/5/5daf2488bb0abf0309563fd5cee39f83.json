  "description": "Enjoy an easy waterside stroll along this lovely canal in East Riding of Yorkshire. The canal runs for about 9 miles from the town of Pocklington to East Cotting with where it joins the River Derwent. It's an easy flat walk along the towpath with some delightful scenery to take in. Along the way you'll pass a number of locks and bridges with nice views of the surrounding countryside. The area is great for wildlife with part of the canal falling within the Lower Derwent Valley National Nature Reserve. Look out for swans, ducks, kingfishers and dragonflies. The route starts just south of Pocklington town centre where Canal Lane meets York Road at Pocklington Canal Head (postcode YO42 1NW). It then passes Bielby, Melbourne and Storwood before finishing at Cottingwith Lock at East Cottingwith. The Wilberforce Way runs along the canal so it's possible to extend your walk along this long distance footpath. It can be followed from the centre of Pocklington to start your walk. Just to the west of Pocklington you can enjoy miles of wide woodland trails in Allerthorpe Woods or pay a visit to the delightful Millington Woods .",
