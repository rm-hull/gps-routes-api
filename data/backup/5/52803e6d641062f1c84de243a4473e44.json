  "description": "Explore 110 acres of beech woodland and open grassland in this country park in Royton. At the highest point in the park there is a war memorial commemorating the men of Royton who died during the First World War. There are also views across the Manchester Plain and the Pennine Hills. Facilities include a cafe and a Countryside Centre with leaflets and information displays on the local area, wildlife and countryside. There are two way-marked walking trails in the park. The green trail follows well surfaced paths and is suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs. The blue trail is more hilly and not suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs. The Thornham cycle trail also passes through the park and offers a nice ride on well layed out paths. You could also continue your walk along the Rochdale Way which runs through Tandle Hill.",

There's picnic tables as well where you can sit outside on warmer days.Just to the north of the viewpoint you'll find The Tanhill Tavern. The friendly pub has good menu and can be found at 14 Thornham Ln with a postcode of M24 2SD for your sat navs. Just head north from the summit and you will find Thornham Road and the pub at the bottom of the hill."

      "content": "One nice idea is to head west from the park along the waymarked Oldham Way. This will lead you into Chadderton where you could have an easy stroll along the towpath of the Rochdale Canal. It's a nice way to continue your outing but with minimal exertion. If you head a few miles south west to Middleton you can explore Alkrington Woods. The nature reserve has some fine trails along the River Irk and a number of small lakes. Near here there's also Heaton Park in Prestwich. The expansive park includes many attractions including a boating lake, an animal farm, woodlands and ornamental gardens. To the south there's the noteworthy Boggart Hole Clough. This attractive park includes some impressive steep ravines, a boating lake, a visitor centre, bike hire and good surfaced paths for cyclists. Just to the east you can pick up the Crompton Circuit and enjoy a circular walk around Shaw and Crompton Moor."
