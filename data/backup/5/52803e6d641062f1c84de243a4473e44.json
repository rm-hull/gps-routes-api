  "description": "Explore 110 acres of beech woodland and open grassland in this country park in Royton. At the highest point in the park there is a war memorial commemorating the men of Royton who died during the First World War. There are also views across the Manchester Plain and the Pennine Hills.  Facilities include a cafe and a Countryside Centre with leaflets and information displays on the local area, wildlife and countryside. There are two way-marked walking trails in the park. The green trail follows well surfaced paths and is suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs. The blue trail is more hilly and  not suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs.  The Thornham cycle trail also passes through the park and offers a nice ride on well layed out paths.  You could also continue your walk along the Rochdale Way which runs through Tandle Hill.",
