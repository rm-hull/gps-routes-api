  "description": "This Buckinghamshire based village has some lovely trails to follow through the surrounding Chilterns countryside. There's lots of peaceful woodland trails, two wildlife rich nature reserves and hill climbs with fine viewpoints to visit in the immediate area. The village is known for The Stokenchurch BT Tower, which can be seen for miles around. There's also a 13th century church and a noteworthy hotel with a history stretching back hundreds of years. This circular walk from the village visits Aston Rowant Nature Reserve and Chinnor Quarry. It uses a mixture of public footpaths, bridleways, country lanes and a section of the epic Ridgeway trail which passes to the west of the settelment. The walk starts in the village and first heads north east to Collier's Lane. This pleasant country track will take you west to Lott Wood and Kingston Wood before turning south west to visit Aston Rowant and Cowleaze Wood. There's miles of pleasant woodland trails here with a large variety of wildlife to look out for. In particular keep your eyes peeled for the rare red kite, a frequent visitor to the area. On the western side of the reserve you can pick up The Ridgeway National Trail and follow it north east past Beacon Hill to the geologically fascinating Chinnor Quarries. There's also the Oakley Hill nature reserve with nice footpaths around a series of lakes with lots of water loving birds to see here. From the reserve you head south east to Crowell Hill and Sprig's Alley before heading south to return to the village via Mallard's Court.",
