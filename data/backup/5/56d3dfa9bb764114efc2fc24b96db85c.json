  "description": "This walk climbs to Carlton Bank on Carlton Moor in the North York Moors National Park. You can start the walk from the car park at Lord Stones Country Park which lies just to the east of the hill. From here you can pick up the Cleveland Way National Trail and follow the waymarked footpath south west for just over half a mile to the 408 metre high summit of Carlton Bank. There's a trig pillar here marking the summit point of Carlton Moor. There are wonderful views here over the village of Carlton in Cleveland to the hills and countryside beyond. The route then descends to the gliding club building before passing the old quarries and returning to the car park.",
