  "description": "This circular walk explores this beautiful valley near Brighton . The valley stretches for about a mile through the South Downs. It is the longest, deepest and widest 'dry valley' in the UK. The area is criss crossed with footpaths and bridleways making it an ideal location for walking and mountain biking. As well as stunning views across the South Downs you will pass lovely meadows with a variety of flowers, an Iron Age Hill Fort and the remains of a Victorian funfair. In the summer months you can enjoy a sea of pink Orchids with a variety of butterflies including Adonis blue, chalkhill blue and silver spotted skipper. You can easily extend your walk by heading east onto Newtimber Hill where you will find one of the finest examples of chalk grassland in the country, ancient woodland and rare plants and flowers such as burnt orchid and juniper tree. Also on the route is the Devils Dyke Pub where you can have some lunch while enjoying some wonderful views. This route starts at the parking area at the western end of Devils Dyke and makes use of the South Downs Way and other footpaths to take you around the Dyke. The area is managed by the National Trust so there are good footpaths and an excellent cafe. This route is designed for walkers but there are many bridleways running across the area so mountain bikers can enjoy the Dyke too. If you'd like to extend your walk you could follow the South Downs Way east and visit Ditchling Beacon - the highest point in East Sussex. If you head west along the South Downs way you can visit Edbarton Hill and Truleigh Hill with its distinctive radio masts. The hill was originally the site of a radar station during the Second World War.",
