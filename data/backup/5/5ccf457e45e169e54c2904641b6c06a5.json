    "description": "This Kent based village sits in a lovely rural location near Tunbridge Wells and Brenchley . The charming settlement includes a picturesque village green with a pond. There's some excellent local pubs for some post walk refreshment too. The village is surrounding by some lovely High Weald countryside and woodland with several footpaths to try. This walk from Matfield makes use of the High Weald Landscape Trail and the Tunbridge Wells Circular Walk to explore the area to the west of the village. The waymarked trails will take you towards Pembury before heading up to Pembury Reservoir, Kent College, Brakeybank Wood and the Tudeley Woods Nature Reserve. The RSPB reserve is a lovely place for a peaceful walk with orchids, bluebells, tree pipits, woodlarks and nightjars to see.",
