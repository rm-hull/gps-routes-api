  "description": "This Hertfordshire based town is a fine place for walkers with river trails along the River Lea, the woodland and parkland of Hatfield House and miles of easily accessible countryside trails to try. This circular walk explores the extensive grounds of Hatfield House on the eastern side of the town. The park is perfect for walking with a number of well maintained paths and three well defined routes: The Blue Walk - (2 miles / 3.2 kilometres / 50 minutes) The Red Walk (3.2 miles / 5.2 kilometres / 90 minutes) The Green Walk (1.1 mile / 1.8 kilometres / 30 minutes) You can pick up an information leaflet from the Gift Shop or Kiosk. The park boasts extensive woodlands, ancient oak trees, a deer park and views of the River Lee. It also has an interesting history having been the childhood home of Queen Elizabeth I during the 16th century. In the park you can see the site of the former oak tree where it is believed she learned of here succession to the throne.",

      "content": "To continue your walking around Hatfield you could pick up the Lea Valley Walk on the northern edge of the town. If you follow the waymarked trail west it will take you to the pretty Lemsford Springs Nature Reserve where there are good wildlife spotting opportunities. You can also visit Brocket Halll and Sherrardspark Wood on the Wheathampstead Walk which starts from the nearby village. Another popular and easy walk near the town is the Alban Way. This shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line from Hatfield to St Albans. Head a few miles south west and you could visit Shenley village. Here you can try the circular Shenley Walk which visits the training grounds of Arsenal F.C and Watford F.C before heading to the village of London Colney where you can enjoy lovely river walks along the River Colne. The walk also visits the noteworthy de Havilland Aircraft Museum. The museum is one of the highlights of the area and a must see for aircraft enthusiasts. There's a wonderful collection of aircraft including the de Havilland Mosquito which is the only surviving World War II twin piston engine prototype of a combat aircraft to be preserved in the World. It can now be viewed by the public on the very site where it was designed and built. The village of Ridge is also located near here. The settlement has a fine local pub with a particularly huge countryside garden area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hertfordshire Walks page."
