    "description": "This Hertfordshire based town is a fine place for walkers with river trails along the River Lea, the woodland and parkland of Hatfield House and miles of easily accessible countryside trails to try. This circular walk explores the extensive grounds of Hatfield House on the eastern side of the town. The park is perfect for walking with a number of well maintained paths and three well defined routes: The Blue Walk - (2 miles / 3.2 kilometres / 50 minutes) The Red Walk (3.2 miles / 5.2 kilometres / 90 minutes) The Green Walk (1.1 mile / 1.8 kilometres / 30 minutes) You can pick up an information leaflet from the Gift Shop or Kiosk. The park boasts extensive woodlands, ancient oak trees, a deer park and views of the River Lee. It also has an interesting history having been the childhood home of Queen Elizabeth I during the 16th century. In the park you can see the site of the former oak tree where it is believed she learned of here succession to the throne.",
