  "description": "This circular walk or cycle visits Lough Lannagh in Castlebar, County Mayo. The multi user trail passes along the north eastern section of the lake, close to the town centre. The loop runs for about 2 km on a good surfaced path with lovely views across the water. You can start your exercise from the lakeside car park on the eastern side of the lake. On the western side there's also Lough Lannagh park which includes a children's play area and a cycle track. Along the way you can also enjoy views to Croagh Patrick mountain in the distance. The Pilgrimage Trail to the top is one of the walking highlights of the Castlebar area. Part of the trail also uses the popular Great Western Greenway. This long distance trail can be used to further explore the area by bike or on foot.",
