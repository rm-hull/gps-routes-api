  "description": "This village in Kent has some fine walking trails to try. This circular walk takes you to some of the highlights of the area including Cobham Park, Jeskyns Park and Shorne Woods Country Park. The walk starts in the village and heads east into Cobham Park. The area is run by the National Trust and includes woodland pasture and an 18th century Darnley Mausoleum. It was designed by James Wyatt for the 4th Earl of Darnley of Cobham Hall according to detailed instructions in the will of the 3rd Earl of Darnley. The site includes a tree trail with a collection of ancient and veteran trees which were formerly part of the Darnley Estate and deer park. The route then bends round to the north to visit Shorne Woods Country Park. Here you will find hundreds of acres of rolling woodlands, wetlands and meadows which can be explored on a variety of waymarked trails. After exploring the park, the route heads south past Ashenbank Wood before branching off to the west to visit Jeskyns Park. Here you'll find woodlands, ponds, orchards and wildflower meadows to explore. After leaving the park it is a short stroll back to Cobham village where the route finishes. The route passes close to Ranscombe Farm Country Park at the eastern fringes. There's 560 acres of attractive meadows and woodland to explore here.",
