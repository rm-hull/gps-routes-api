  "description": "This historic market town in Flintshire has some interesting old buildings, a fine 15th century church and views of the hearby Clwydian Range. For walkers there's two noteworthy local country parks, river paths along the Alyn River and a pretty local nature reserve to explore. This walk from the town takes you to two of the highlights of the area at Loggerheads Country Park, Moel Famau Country Park. The walk starts at the remains of Mold Castle in the town centre. You then head through the town before picking up a nice country lane to take you west to the Cefn Mawr Quarry and Loggerheads Country Park. There's a fine wooded gorge, impressive limestone cliffs and river walks along the River Alyn to enjoy in this lovely park. From the park you continue west past Ffrith Mountain to Moel Famau. The mountain is a popular place for walkers with views of the Clwydian Range, the Wirral, Merseyside, Snowdonia, the Dee Valley and the coast.",
