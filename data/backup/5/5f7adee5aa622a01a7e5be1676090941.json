  "description": "This walk takes you along a particularly lovely section of the Jurassic coastline near Weymouth in Dorset. The circular walk starts at Southdown at the good sized National Trust car park. It's also a terrific viewpoint with views over Weymouth Bay to Portland. A good footpath then takes you down to Burning Cliff where you pick up the South West Coast Path to White Nothe. The cliffs and views at White Nothe are particularly special. You can then return the same way or pick up the altrenative bridleway to take you back to the car park. This stretch has some wonderful coastal scenery with bays, beaches and spectacular cliffs. There is also some lovely countryside to enjoy and the option of following a steep track down to the shingle beach. You can extend your walk by continuing a few miles east and visiting the beautiful Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door. Another good option is to head west along the coast path an visit Osmington Mills and Osmington Bay. From here you can climb to the Osmington White Horse and enjoy more fabulous views of the area.",

Situated on the cliff tops of the South West Coast Path, just outside the village of Osmington, the Smugglers Inn is a traditional English pub with stunning views overlooking the Isle of Portland. The pub also has an interesting history having been the headquarters of the French smuggler Pierre Latour and one of the main landing places for smuggled goods in the 17th century. Notably the Inn was originally built in the 13th century, with its own brewery at the rear. There's a lovely large garden area which is perfect for relaxing in when the weather is fine. You can fine the pub right on the coast at a postcode of DT3 6HF for your sat navs."
