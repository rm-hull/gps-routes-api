    "description": "This walk takes you along a particularly lovely section of the Jurassic coastline near Weymouth in Dorset. The circular walk starts at Southdown at the good sized National Trust car park. It's also a terrific viewpoint with views over Weymouth Bay to Portland. A good footpath then takes you down to Burning Cliff where you pick up the South West Coast Path to White Nothe. The cliffs and views at White Nothe are particularly special. You can then return the same way or pick up the altrenative bridleway to take you back to the car park. This stretch has some wonderful coastal scenery with bays, beaches and spectacular cliffs. There is also some lovely countryside to enjoy and the option of following a steep track down to the shingle beach. You can extend your walk by continuing a few miles east and visiting the beautiful Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door . Another good option is to head west along the coast path an visit Osmington Mills and Osmington Bay. From here you can climb to the Osmington White Horse and enjoy more fabulous views of the area.",
