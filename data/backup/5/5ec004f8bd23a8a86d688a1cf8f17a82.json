    "description": "This walk visits the picturesque Linn Falls in Aberlour, Moray. You can start the walk from the parking area near the the Aberlour Distillery and the cemetery at the end of the High Street. Then pick up the trail heading south along the Burn of Aberlour. The well maintained path will lead you to the secluded falls which are surrounded by attractive woodland. It's a lovely spot with a couple of benches to rest on and enjoy the view. The Speyside Way runs through the town so you could pick this up at the northern end of the burn. The shared walking and cycling path will take you along the River Spey providing an opportunity to extend your waterside walking in the area. See the Dufftown to Aberlour Walk for more details.",
