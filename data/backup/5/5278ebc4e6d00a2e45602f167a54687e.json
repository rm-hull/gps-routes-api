The former 140 ft long tithe barn on the edge of the Common used to be divided into hay barn, chaff cutting shed, corn barn, and a stable for four horses. It has since been converted into accommodation and The Coach House and Stable are two holiday flats incorporated in the western end of the building."

The tower dates from the late 14th century and the chancel, as we see it today, was rebuilt later. North aisle and south porch date from a 19th century restoration. The church still houses the original medieval font. The most interesting feature of St Mary's is its 15th century stained glass some of which was moved to here from St Mary's church in Martham in the 19th century. An interesting and unusual memorial dating from the 17th century can be found on the south side of the chancel arch: two copper plates are resting on a bible which has been set into the wall. The copper plates open like a book, revealing the epitaph of 'the most Religious Mrs Sarah Scargill'."

  "description": "This Norfolk based village is located just south of Norwich. It's a pleasant place for a walk with a pretty village green, a pond, a common and a 17th century pub to relax in after your exercise. This circular walk explores the common before following country footpaths into the pleasant countryside to the east of the settlement. On the way you will pass the noteworthy church which has a tower dating back to the 14th century and some fine 15th century stained glass. The Tas Valley Way also passes through the village. The long distance trail runs from Cringleford, near Norwich, to Attleborough, with waterside sections along the River Tas. Mulbarton is also on the Hethersett and Swardeston Country Walk which runs between the two neighbouring villages.",
