  "description": "This pretty park and nature reserve is located in the centre of Bristol. It's a splendid place to go for a stroll with a wildflower meadow, ponds and the impressive Cabot Tower. You can climb the 105 feet (32 m) high tower for panoramic views over the city. The park is good for wildlife spotting. Look out for frogs, toads and newts in the pond and birds such as blackcap and jay in the woodland area. You can also try the tree trail and learn about different species of trees in the park. If you would like to continue your walking in Bristol then you could pick up the River Avon Trail and follow it to the nearby Leigh Woods. Here you will find a nature reserve with miles of peaceful woodland trails.",
