  "description": "Enjoy a little stroll along this reservoir in the valley of the River Tryweryn. You can park at the car park on the western side of the lake. There's a footpath here through some lakeside woodland and along the water. It's a great viewpoint with views right across the lake to the surrounding countryside and hills. Just to the west of the car park there's some other public footpaths which climb above the lake for more nice views. At the eastern end of the site you will find the dam and some nice trails along the River Tryweryn to try. These can be picked up from Canolfan Tryweryn, the National White Water Centre for Wales. To continue your walking in the area head to the south side of the lake and visit Llyn Arenig Fawr and then climb to Arenig Fawr for great views over the area. You could also visit Bala Lake (or Llyn Tegid). It's the largest natural lake in Wales and has some splendid walking trails to follow. There's also the Bala Lake steam railway to experience.",
