  "description": "This Derbyshire based village is in a great location for exploring some of the major Peak District highlights on foot. Taddington is also noted for its historic 14th century church while on Taddington Moor you can visit the ancient Five Wells chambered tomb. This circular walk from the village visits Litton Mill, Miller's Dale, the fabulous viewpoint at Monsal Head, Taddington Dale and Taddington Wood. Part of the route uses a section of the popular Monsal Trail, a shared cycling and walking trail running just north of the village. Along the way there's some wonderful views of the surrounding Peak District hills and some waterside sections along the pretty River Wye.",
