  "description": "This attractive Buckinghamshire village has a number of photogenic ancient buildings, quaint thatched cottages and some pleasant riverside trails for walkers. The settlement lies just over a mile north of the Oxfordshire town of Thame. This circular walk from the village uses part of the Thame Valley Walk and the Bernwood Jubilee Way to visit the historic Notley Abbey. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Thame Valley Walk and follow it north east through the settlement. You'll pass the Long Crendon Courthouse which dates to the 15th century and is run by the National Trust. The timber framed medieval property houses an interesting historical exhibition on the village. You continue east into the countryside, passing Cop Hill before coming to Notley Abbey. The Augustinian abbey was founded in the 12th century and sits in a fine location by the River Thame. Today the remains are used to host weddings and private events. You can follow a pleasant riverside footpath south west along the river for about a quarter of a mile. At the end of the river path you have the option of returning on the same trails or passing through the Industrial Estate and rejoining the Thame Valley Way on the Thame Road.",
