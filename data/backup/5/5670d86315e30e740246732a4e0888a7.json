  "description": "A circular walk to School Knott Fell near Windemere in the Lake District. The walk is a nice one to do if you are staying in the Windermere area. You'll visit a pretty little tarn, follow some peaceful woodland trails and enjoy fine views from the elevated position of the fell. The route runs for just over 2 miles with a fairly easy climb on the way. The walk starts from the Heathwaite area of the town, located just to the south east of the train station. From here you can pick up a trail heading south east up to School Knott. The summit stands at a height of 760 feet (230 m) offering fine views over Windermere Lake below. After taking in the views the route heads east to School Knott Tarn and Grandsire hill which stands at a height of 818 feet (249 m). From the tarn head north and it will take you to the School Knott Plantation. There's some nice woodland trails to follow through hear before returning to Heathwaite.",
