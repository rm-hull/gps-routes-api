Commenced around 1810 it was never completed and the Egyptian styled tower collapsed in a storm in 1862. I believe the ruin was tidied up into a viewing platform in 1970 gaining it a countryside award."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you up to the summit of Moel Famau in the Clwydian  Mountain Range. The walk begins from a car park close to the summit and follows a waymarked trail to the top. As such it is probably the easiest route to the top. Starting from the public car park you follow the Offa's Dyke Path north west and then north east for a distance of about 2.5km. From the summit there are some glorious views over the surrounding mountains.  There's also the 19th century Jubilee Tower to admire at the top. After taking in the views the walk descends south along the woodland trails of the Clwyd Forest before turning west along the road to return to the car park.",
