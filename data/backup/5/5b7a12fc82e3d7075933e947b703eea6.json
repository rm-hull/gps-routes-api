  "description": "Enjoy walking and cycling along the River Cole in this pretty country park in South Birmingham. The area includes a number of nature reserves, Babbs Mill Lake and Shard End Lake. In the park you'll find grassland, wetland and woodland. The main attraction is the nice waterside cycling and walking path along the river. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for including herons, kingfishers, skylarks, water voles and mink. The Solihull Way passes along the eastern end of the park so you could pick this up to continue your walk. You can follow it to Chelmsley Wood and Alcott Wood along the Kingshurst Brook. Sheldon Country Park is also on the route and another nice local place for a walk or cycle.",

      "content": "The River Cole Valley Cycle Route passes through the park and can be followed all the way to Yardley Wood along the river. It's a 10 mile route along a nice flat path, passing through the Birmingham suburbs and linking with the Grand Union Canal Walk. On the way it passes the noteworthy Sarehole Mill. The 16th century mill is notable as Birmingham's last surviving water mill and well worth a visit. Near the mill there's the Moseley Bog Nature Reserve to visit as well. Here you can enjoy more easy trails around the ancient woodland with lots of wildlife to see on the way. The circular Solihull Walk can be picked up nearby. It visits several of the local highlights including the Grand Union Canal, the Stratford Upon Avon Canal, Knowle, the National Trust's Baddesley Clinton, the bluebells in Hay Wood and the lovely Earlswood Lakes. For more walking ideas in the area see the West Midlands Walks page."
