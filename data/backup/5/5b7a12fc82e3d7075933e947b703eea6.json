    "description": "Enjoy walking and cycling along the River Cole in this pretty country park in South Birmingham. The area includes a number of nature reserves, Babbs Mill Lake and Shard End Lake. In the park you'll find grassland, wetland and woodland. The main attraction is the nice waterside cycling and walking path along the river. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for including herons, kingfishers, skylarks, water voles and mink. The Solihull Way passes along the eastern end of the park so you could pick this up to continue your walk. You can follow it to Chelmsley Wood and Alcott Wood along the Kingshurst Brook. Sheldon Country Park is also on the route and another nice local place for a walk or cycle.",
