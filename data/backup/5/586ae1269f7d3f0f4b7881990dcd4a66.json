  "description": "Enjoy a splendid riverside walk in the beautiful Lathkill Dale in the Peak District. The dale is a peaceful, atmospheric area flanked with large limestone cliffs and woodland. Along the River Lathkill you'll pass pretty waterfalls and weirs and a wide variety of flora and fauna. Look out for birds such as ducks, herons, wagtails, dippers, waterhens and coots. The river is very clear and pure so it's easy to spot fish swimming alongside you on your walk. Along the river there are also interesting flora such as wildflowers and the rare wild plant\u00a0Jacob's Ladder. This circular walk begins in the lovely village of Monyash at the excellent Bulls Head Pub, and follows footpaths through Bagshaw Dale to the river. You follow the river to Over Haddon where you can stop for refreshments at the splendidly positioned Lathkil Hotel. You then return on the same path for about half the way, before crossing the river and picking up the Limestone Way to take you back to Monyash. This is a super, varied walk with riverside, woodland and countryside sections to enjoy. Most of it is fairly flat so it's suitable for people of all abilities. If you'd like to extend your walking in the area you could head further along the river to Alport. You could also pick up the Limestone Way and head to nearby Yougreave where you can enjoy more waterside walking along the River Bradford in Bradford Dale . Our Youlgreave Circular Walk visits Lathkill Dale from the village if you would prefer to start from there. Just over a mile south of Lathkill Dale you'll find the fascinating Arbor Low . This well preserved Neolithic henge monument is well worth a visit. The atmospheric limestone circle sits in an elevated position\u00a0with great views over the surrounding moors of the White Peak.",
