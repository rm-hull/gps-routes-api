  "description": "Climb to a distinctive hill on this circular walk on Saddleworth Moor, Oldham. There's fantastic views over the Peak District from the elevated position of the moor. You'll also encounter a number of interesting rock formations at the summit. Start the walk from the parking area next to St Chads on Church Lane, in the village of Saddleworth. From here you head east through the village where you can pick up a footpath heading north to Running Hill Lane. Turn east to follow country lanes and footpaths up to Broadstone Hill. The walk then turns south, passing Slades Rocks and Shaw Rock before coming to Dick Hill. You continue to Alderman's Hill before heading to Pots and Pans. Here you will find an Obelisk and a number of rock formations, with a wonderful backdrop of Peak District Hills. The war memorial on the hill commemorates Saddleworth's losses in the two World Wars. It's a very photogenic location with fine views over the city of Manchester to enjoy as well. After taking in the views the route descends back to the car park, passing Primrose Hill on the way. You can enjoy refreshments in one of the cafes in Saddleworth or nearby Uppermill. The hill is located just to the west of Dovestone Reservoir, Yeoman Hey Reservoir and Greenfield Reservoir. There's some lovely waterside paths to pick up here. Part of the route uses the Oldham Way long distance trail which runs across the hill. You could continue along the trail to extend the walk.",
