  "description": "This large forest in Snowdonia is fantastic for both cycling and walking. For walkers there are 4 well devised, all ability trails taking place on wide well maintained paths. The trails take you along the Afon Eden on a sculpture lined riverside path and along a disused tramway to the old Copper processing mill. If you're looking for more strenuous walking then you can pick up one of the 3 difficult routes. The waterfall trail takes you to the confluence of the Afon Gain and Mawddach with their twin waterfalls. The mountain trail climbs to the Mynydd Penrhos ridge with spectacular views of the surrounding area. Cyclists can follow a National Cycle Network trail which runs through the park. There are also a number of graded mountain bike trails. Depending on your ability and experience you can follow the blue moderate trail for a good introduction to singletrack mountain biking. The red trails are more difficult while the black (severe) trails are for the experienced mountain biker. There are 7 trails in all plus an easy forest road trail that follows the Mawddach river valley. This one is good for families looking for a more relaxing ride! The circular route below starts near the visitor centre and takes you along the National Cycle Network trail and a riverside track. It's suitable for both walkers and cyclists.",
