  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around this reservoir in North Yorkshire. It's a lovely, quiet spot, with great views across the surrounding moors, hills and countryside. Start the walk from the car park at the south eastern end of the water. It's located at the end of Pasture Road, just to the north of the village of Embsay. You could also walk from the village, if you prefer. From the car park you can directly pick up the nice footpath running around the water. At the northern end there's a moderate climb to Crag Nook, with nice views back down to the water. To extend your walking in the area just head north east and visit the Barden Reservoirs.",
