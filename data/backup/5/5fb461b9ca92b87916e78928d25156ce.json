  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around this reservoir in North Yorkshire. It's a lovely, quiet spot, with great views across the surrounding moors, hills and countryside. Start the walk from the car park at the south eastern end of the water. It's located at the end of Pasture Road, just to the north of the village of Embsay. You could also walk from the village, if you prefer. From the car park you can directly pick up the nice footpath running around the water. At the northern end there's a moderate climb to Crag Nook, with nice views back down to the water. To extend your walking in the area just head north east and visit the Barden Reservoirs.",

      "content": "The Embsay and Bolton Abbey Railway is a great way to see the lovely scenery surrounding the reservoir. You can pick up the heritage railway at the southern end of the village at Embsay station. Here you can enjoy a ride on a vintage steam locomotive from Embsay via Draughton Sidings, Holywell and Stoneacre Loop to Bolton Abbey. The rolling stock on the line consists of 20 ex-industrial locomotives, the oldest of which was built in 1908, three diesel-multiple units, and ten other diesel locomotives. Embsay station dates back to 1888 and has good facilities with a cafe, gift shop, bookshop and picnic tables. It's a nice place to stroll around and watch the trains come in and go out. Just to the south there's Skipton Castle and Woods. There's some nice trails around the historic castle and through its adjacent woodland area. There's also a couple of other local reservoir walks to be found at the nearby Barden Reservoir and Chelker Reservoir. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks page."
