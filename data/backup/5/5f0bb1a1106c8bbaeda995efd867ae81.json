The majestic contours of Chrome Hill form an imposing backdrop."

  "description": "This Peak District village is located in a fine spot for scenic walks in the National Park. This circular walk from the village takes you up to the splendid viewpoints on Parkhouse Hill and Chrome Hill which lie just to the east of the settlement. You'll also pass Hollins Hill on the northern side of the village. Along the way there are wonderful views over the National Park and some photogenic limeston rock formations to admire. To continue your walking in the area head west onto Axe Edge Moor and you could visit one of the major local highlights at Three Shires Head. Here you will find an ancient packhorse bridge located at the point where the counties of Cheshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire meet.",
