  "description": "This easy circular walk explores the National Trust owned Bolberry Down on the Devon coast. It's a splendid place for walk with a fully accessible surfaced path, wildflowers in the summer, pockets of gorse and spectacular coastal views towards Burgh Island and Bigbury on Sea. You can start your walk from the National Trust car park, just to the south of the village of Bolberry. Then pick up the one mile path around the site. If you prefer a longer walk you could start from nearby Salcombe and follow the South West Coast Path to the down. To extend your walk you can follow the coast path west to the headland of Bolt Tail. Heading in the other direction will take you to towards Salcombe where you can try the Salcombe and Bolt Head Circular Walk. Just a mile south east of the car park is Soar Mill Cove where you will find a picturesque cove, a secluded sandy beach and the wonderfully positioned Soar Mill Cove Hotel.",

      "content": "Head east and you can try the Salcombe and Kingsbridge Estuary Walk where there's lots of wildlife to look out for and a lovely waterside inn. Follow the coast path north and you can pick up the circular Bigbury on Sea Walk which visits Burgh Island and the Avon Estuary. Here you can also link up with the Thurlestone and Bantham Walk. On this coastal walk you'll visit the National Trust's lovely South Milton beach, the striking Thurlestone Rock Arch and a great beachside seafood cafe. A few miles to the north east there's the worthy village of Loddiswell where you can enjoy some fine trails through the River Avon Valley. The village includes an historic 14th century church and the old Loddiswell Railway Station as well. Near here there's the climb to the viewpoint and Iron Age Hillfort at Blackdown Rings and the pretty riverside village of Aveton Gifford to explore. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
