  "description": "This easy circular walk explores the National Trust owned Bolberry Down on the Devon coast. It's a splendid place for walk with a fully accessible surfaced path, wildflowers in the summer, pockets of gorse and spectacular coastal views towards Burgh Island and Bigbury on Sea. You can start your walk from the National Trust car park, just to the south of the village of Bolberry. Then pick up the one mile path around the site. If you prefer a longer walk you could start from nearby Salcombe and follow the South West Coast Path to the down. To extend your walk you can follow the coast path west to the headland of Bolt Tail. Heading in the other direction will take you to towards Salcombe where you can try the Salcombe and Bolt Head Circular Walk. Just a mile south east of the car park is Soar Mill Cove where you will find a picturesque cove, a secluded sandy beach and the wonderfully positioned Soar Mill Cove Hotel.",
