  "description": "A circular walk through this lovely 270 acre deer park near Bath. There are magnificent views of the surrounding Gloucestershire countryside to enjoy as you tour the beautifully laid out park and gardens. The West Garden has tranquil ponds and a wild flower orchard while the 17th-century mansion has grand interiors and superb art collection including Dutch art and ceramics. The Cotswold Way passes the western edge of the park. You could easily extend your walk by picking up the trail and follow it north to visit Doddington Park, Old Sodbury and Chipping Sodbury. The attractive market town is well worth seeing with a number of historic houses lining the main street. Also nearby is the town of Marshfield where you can try our circular walk which visits the delightful village of West Kington.",

      "content": "Just a few miles south west of the park there's a bit of a hidden gem at Wick Quarry. The quarry is now a popular place for walkers with the surrounding Golden Valley Nature Reserve great for wildlife and views of the River Boyd. The circular Pucklechurch Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the park before heading to the pretty village of Doynton. For more walking ideas in the area see the Gloucestershire Walks page."
