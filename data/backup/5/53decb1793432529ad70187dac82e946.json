  "description": "This Britain in Bloom award-winning town is located a few miles from the River Severn in South Gloucestershire. A popular waymarked trail passes through the area and there's nice river estuary walks to pick up nearby. There's also a historic local castle and fine old church to visit on the town's heritage trail. This waymarked trail encompasses the town's historic buildings and starts outside the town hall. This circular walk from the town heads to the river to visit the iconic Severn Bridge before returning via the neighbouring village of Oldbury on Severn. The walk starts from Thornbury Castle on the western side of the town. The structure dates to Tudor times and is Grade I listed. From the castle you can follow footpaths south to link up with the Jubilee Way. Follow the waymarked trail west to the little village of Littleton Upon Severn and then on to the river. Turn south here to visit the famous bridge which crosses the river into Wales. The route then picks up the Severn Way and follows it north to visit Oldbury on Severn. This pretty village is located near the mouth of the River Severn an has some nice paths along Oldbury Hill. There's also a fine old church which sits in an elevated position above the village. There's excellent views back down to the estuary from here. After exploring the village of Oldbury the route then heads south east on public footpaths to return to Thornbury.",

      "content": "The Oldbury on Severn Walk starts from the neighbouring village and will take you to the historic Berkeley Castle. The Grade I listed castle has a fascinating history dating back to the 11th century. There's also some beautiful grounds and gardens to stroll around. It's located a few miles north of Thornbury and one of the highlights of the area. At the Severn Bridge you can pick up the popular Severn Beach Walk. This riverside route takes you along the sea wall to the village of Severn Beach. You could also cross the famous bridge into Wales and visit Chepstow and the historic Tintern Abbey. If you continue north along the Severn Way from Oldbury you will come to Newtown and the noteworthy Purton Hulks. This unusual site includes a number of abandoned boats and ships which were deliberately beached beside the river to reinforce the river banks between 1909 and 1965. You can also enjoy a stroll along the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal here. A few miles to the south west you can visit the worthy village of Almondsbury. Here you can enjoy a climb to the excellent viewpoint at Almondsbury hill and visit the notable 12th century church and fine 16th century pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Gloucestershire Walks page."
