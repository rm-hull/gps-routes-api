Goodwood Country Park is an area of public access land (owned by the Goodwood Estate) adjacent to the Goodwood Racecourse on top of the South Downs. The area is mainly broadleaf woodland, with two main grassy open spaces (this car park is one of them), one at the E of the area and one at the W. The country park has an extensive network of paths and, in places, offers views over towards the nearby city of Chichester."

There's miles of nice woodland trails and some moderate hill climbs with splendid views over the South Downs, Chichester, the Isle of Wight and the famous Goodwood Racecourse. You can extend your walk by following the Monarch's Way to the nearby Eartham Woods and Slindon Estate where there are miles of cyling and walking trails to try. You can also climb to The Trundle Iron Age Hillfort for great views over the racecourse. Our West Dean to East Dean Walk takes you between the two villages, via the fort.",
