  "description": "These woods on the outskirts of Cardiff have a series of peaceful walking trails to try. You can start the walk from the car park off the Rudry Road, just north of Lisvane. Then pick up the trails heading west into the forest where there's lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for. The site also includes nice viewpoints with fine views over the Brecon Beacons, Cardiff and Newport. You can access these by picking up the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk which skirts the northern end of the forest. If you wanted to extend the walk you could follow the waymarked trail west to Taff's Well in the lovely Taff Vale.",

The pub has a great terraced area where you can sit outside and enjoy fine views of the Rhymney Valley countryside. It's a lovely spot and can be found near the forest at a postcode of CF83 3EB. You could also visit the village's 13th century church and enjoy a climb to the viewpoint on Rudry mountain just to the west of the settlement."

To the east is Ruperra Castle where you can see the ruins of a mock-castle manor house originally built in 1626 by Sir Thomas Morgan. Public footpaths go quite close to the private house, located just south of Draethen."
