  "description": "This is a lovely walk to try if you are visiting the pretty Luss Village in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The short climb gives fabulous views over the surrounding area. The walk starts in Luss at the car park and visitor centre. You then follow a footpath out of the village through some woodland before climbing Beinn Dubh on a nice grassy path. There are simply wonderful views of Loch Lomond, Glen Luss and the Arrochar Alps to enjoy. You can return the same way or continue to Mid Hill along the Glen Striddle Horseshoe.",
