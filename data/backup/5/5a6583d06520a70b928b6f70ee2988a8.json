  "description": "The Farne Islands are located just 1.5 miles from the Northumberland Coast at Bamburgh. You can catch a boat from Seahouses harbour to Inner Farne, the largest of the islands. Here you can see colonies of grey seals and up to 37000 pairs of puffins. The islands attract many other seabirds including Guillemots, Razorbills, Sandwich Terns, Common Terns, Roseate Terns, Arctic Terns, Shags, Cormorants and Eider Ducks. There is a lovely walkway around Inner Farne taking you past the interesting buildings which date from the monastic period. These include the remains of the old Guest House, the Chapel of St Cuthbert with fine stained-glass windows and the Pele Tower. The islands are run by the National Trust so entry is free for members. To continue your walking in the area try the Seahouses to Bamburgh walk and visit the fascinating coastal castle. The long distance St Oswald's Way also passes the islands and is a great way to explore the Northumberland Coast AONB.",
