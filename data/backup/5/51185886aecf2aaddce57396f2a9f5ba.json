  "description": "This walk climbs to one of the highest spots in the Birmingham area. The beacon is located to the north of the city, not far from Walsall. You can start from the car park next to the hill and follow a circular footpath around the site. From the 236 m (774 ft) summit there's great views over the city to several landmarks including The Wrekin, Lickey Hills Country Park, Cannock Chase Country Park, and Lichfield Cathedral. On a clear day you can even see the hills and mountains of Wales. On the top of the hill there's also a distinctive domed war memorial. The structure was built in 1932 to commemorate those that gave their lives in the Great War of 1914 to 1918. Surrounding the hill is some pleasant countryside so its easy to continue your walk if you have time.",
