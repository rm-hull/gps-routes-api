  "description": "This walk climbs to one of the highest spots in the Birmingham area. The beacon is located to the north of the city, not far from Walsall. You can start from the car park next to the hill and follow a circular footpath around the site. From the 236 m (774 ft) summit there's great views over the city to several landmarks including The Wrekin, Lickey Hills Country Park, Cannock Chase Country Park, and Lichfield Cathedral. On a clear day you can even see the hills and mountains of Wales. On the top of the hill there's also a distinctive domed war memorial. The structure was built in 1932 to commemorate those that gave their lives in the Great War of 1914 to 1918. Surrounding the hill is some pleasant countryside so its easy to continue your walk if you have time.",

      "content": "The long distance Beacon Way passes over the hill, providing an opportunity for extending your walk. You could follow it to the nearby Sandwell Valley Country Park, Park Lime Pits or Chasewater Country Park. The splendid Walsall Arboretum and the Walsall Canal are other good options in the area around the hill. Just to the east of the hill there's Sutton Coldfield and the expansive Sutton Park where there are miles of good cycling and walking trails. Just to the north you can enjoy more waterside trails along the Wyrley and Essington Canal. The canal winds its way pleasantly through Wolverhampton and Walsall, visiting Park Lime Pits, the wildlife rich Pelsall Common Nature Reserve and Rough Wood Country Park on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the West Midlands Walks page."
