Rather than proceed down to the main forestry road as shown on the O.S. 1:50000 map, this one actually turns sharp left at the end of this visible stretch and doubles back down towards the waterfall."

The bank in the foreground leads down to the arch's new by-pass. Traffic is now prevented from going through the arch."

  "description": "This National Trust managed estate is located in the Ystwyth valley in Ceredigion. The 18th century estate is a fine place for walkers with a network of waymarked footpaths taking you through attractive wooded gorges. Features include riverside trails, cascading waterfalls, restored gardens and photogenic bridges over rocky gorges. The area is also great for wildlife with notable birds including goshawks, buzzards, red kites and kingfishers to look our for. You may also see otters in the river or pine martens and roe deer in the woodland area. This circular walk starts from the estate car park where there is a detailed information board and a map of the area. You'll then follow sections of the Lady's Walk and the Gentleman's Walk through the woodlands and along the Ystwyth River. On the way you will also visit the rushing Rhaeadr Peiran which is a splendid sight after rainfall. To continue your walking in the area head a few miles north to visit Devil's Bridge Falls. Here you can climb the steep stone steps of Jacob's Ladder and enjoy some fine views of the gushing waterfalls.",
