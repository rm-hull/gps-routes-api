  "description": "Widely considered to be the most spectacular coastal headland on the Pembrokeshire Coast, this stunning area is a must see when visiting the National Park. This circular walk makes use of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and other public footpaths to take you on a tour of the St David's Peninsula. You'll enjoy great views over the beautiful Whitesands Bay towards the nearby Ramsey Island. The area is also geologically fascinating. You will pass Carn Llidi, a huge jagged tor, towering above the coast. You can climb the tor for stunning views to the east. The route also passes the Neolithic burial chamber of Coetan Arthur which dates from about 4000BC. To continue your walking in the area head to the city of St David's and try the Solva to St David's Coastal Walk. It's another lovely section of the coast with highlights including the ruins of St Non's Chapel and the purple sandstone cliffs at Caerfai Bay.",

Just to the south there's the wonderful Treginnis Peninsula to explore. Here you can enjoy views towards Skomer Island and the oldest volcanic rocks in Wales, formed over 600 million years ago. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pembrokeshire Coast Walks page."
