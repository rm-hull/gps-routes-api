Much of the film was filmed on the grounds of Ashford Castle. The town and castle area remain little changed since 1952, and Cong's connection with the movie make it a tourist attraction. The village was also the home of Anglo-Irish landlord Sir William Wilde, who was a historian and father to prominent playwright, novelist, poet, and short story writer Oscar Wilde."

    "description": "This walk explores the historic Ashford Castle in the village of Cong, on the borders of County Galway and County Mayo. The castle dates back to the medieval period and is now run as a hotel. Non residents can visit for afternoon tea or to book an activity including the popular hawk walks. These one hour walks give you the opportunity to take a Harris Hawk around the grounds under the guidance of an expert instructor. See the more information link below for full details and prices. In the estate there's also pretty gardens, a fountain and some pleasant woodland trails to try. After exploring the castle grounds you can then follow trails north along the Ashford Castle Lake and River Cong to visit the attractive village of Cong. On the way there's views of an ancient stone circle and a medieval abbey. There's also some peaceful woodland trails in the adjacent Cong Woods if you'd like to extend the walk further. The castle sits on the Galway side of Lough Corrib, the largest lake in the Republic of Ireland. For more details on the lough and a walk at the southern end from Oughterard see the Lough Corrib Walk page. See the BBC video below for more information, history and a wonderful look around the castle.",
