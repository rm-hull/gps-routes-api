It starts (or finishes, depending upon your point of view) in the Ironbridge Gorge here at Coalport, and finishes (or starts) 13 miles away just outside Bratton on the B5063."

  "description": "Follow the Silkin Way through Shropshire and enjoy Rivers, parks and historical villages. The path starts by Coalport Bridge on the River Severn and heads north towards Telford passing the fascinating Blists Hill Victorian Town at Madeley. The museum attempts to recreate the sights, sounds and smells of a Victorian Shropshire town in the late 19th century and early 20th century and is well worth a visit. The path then heads through the attractive Telford Town Park and then on through the Telford town centre. You then pass through Wrockwardine Wood and Hadley Park before you come to the lovely Apley Castle Park. The park is a haven for wildlife and the feeding grounds for many species of birds, in particular the endangered Song Thrush, Jay, Woodpecker, Pheasant and Grouse. The final section then takes you through Dothill before finishing at Bratton. Some of the route runs along the old disused railway line so is suitable for cyclists. These sections are flat and surfaced so are ideal for families looking for an easy, safe cycle ride.",
