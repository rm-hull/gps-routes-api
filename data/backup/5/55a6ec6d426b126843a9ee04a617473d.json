  "description": "This Cambridgeshire based village is located close to Huntingdon and St Ives. It's a nice place for country and riverside walks with the River Great Ouse running just to the north of the settlement. There's also the noteworthy Hemingford Grey Manor which dates from the 12th century. The interesting house and gardens are open to visitors. It is notable as one of the two oldest continually inhabited houses in Britain. This circular walk starts from the manor house and first takes you across Hemingford Meadow to neighbouring St Ives. Here you can cross the River Ouse on St Ives Bridge which includes an ancient chapel. Head west along the pretty town quay towards Houghton where you can explore the delightful Houghton Mill. The route then visits Hemingford Abbots before returning to the village.",
