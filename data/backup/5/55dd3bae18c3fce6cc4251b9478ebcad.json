    "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around Greenboth Reservoir and the Naden Reservoirs on this route in the Rochdale area of Greater Manchester. It's a lovely, peaceful area with nice views towards Manchester and the nearby Scout Moor Wind Farm , the highest point of the Rossendale Valley. With four reservoirs to walk to and great views of the surrounding moorland scenery there's plenty to see in the area. The Rochdale Way passes the reservoirs so you could pick this up and head west across Knowl Moor to Knowl Hill to extend your walk. You could then descend to Ashworth Moor where you can visit the lovely Owd Betts pub and try a walk around Ashworth Moor Reservoir . If you head east you can visit Spring Mill Reservoir and the town of Whitworth. Near here is Watergrove Reservoir where you can pick up the waterside trail and enjoy views of the surrounding attractive moorland with great views across Manchester to the Cheshire plain. Just to the south there's the Ashworth Valley where there's nice trails along the Naden Brook and the Cheesden Brook.",
