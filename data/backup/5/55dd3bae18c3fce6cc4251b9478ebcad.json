  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around Greenboth Reservoir and the Naden Reservoirs on this route in the Rochdale area of Greater Manchester. It's a lovely, peaceful area with nice views towards Manchester and the nearby Scout Moor Wind Farm, the highest point of the Rossendale Valley. With four reservoirs to walk to and great views of the surrounding moorland scenery there's plenty to see in the area. The Rochdale Way passes the reservoirs so you could pick this up and head west across Knowl Moor to Knowl Hill to extend your walk. You could then descend to Ashworth Moor where you can visit the lovely Owd Betts pub and try a walk around Ashworth Moor Reservoir. If you head east you can visit Spring Mill Reservoir and the town of Whitworth. Near here is Watergrove Reservoir where you can pick up the waterside trail and enjoy views of the surrounding attractive moorland with great views across Manchester to the Cheshire plain. Just to the south there's the Ashworth Valley where there's nice trails along the Naden Brook and the Cheesden Brook.",

      "content": "Head west of the water and visit the noteworthy Owd Betts for some post walk refreshments. This traditional country pub dates all the way back to 1796. They have a good menu and a fine outdoor area with lovely views over the surrounding moors. It's a great place to relax with a drink after your exercise. You can find the pub right next to Ashworth Moor Reservoir on Edenfield Rd with a postcode of OL12 7TY for your sat navs. The inn is also dog friendly if you are with your canine friend.  Pictured above Owd Betts and the views from the pub. This stone building was built overlooking the Cheeseden Valley in 1796 by Richard and Mary Ashworth, probably as a farmhouse. By the time that the building passed to their son, Richard, and his wife, Betty, in the mid 1800s it had become an inn named the 'Hare and Hounds.\u0092 Following the death of her husband Betty continued to run the inn alone and it was probably during this period that it became affectionately known as \u0091Owd Betts.\u0092 In 1893 Betty too passed away at the age of 93, but the pub continued to be known as \u0091Owd Betts.\u0092 However, it was not until the 1950s that, in deference to the grand lady, the name of the pub was officially changed from the 'Hare and Hounds\u0092 to that by which it is known today, \u0091Owd Betts.\u0092"
