The trail passes through several woods with bridleways suitable for cycling as well as walking. The walk begins at Chesham and passes Amersham, Chenies, Chorleywood, Chalfont St Peter, Chalfont St Giles, Great Missenden and Little Missenden. Highlights on the walk include the splendid Chenies Manor House and Gardens. Located in the village of Chenies the estate is highly recommended with its enchanting Tudor Manor House and award winning gardens. Near Chalfont St Peter you will find the fascinating Chiltern Open Air Museum. The museum rescues and restores common English buildings from the Chilterns and relocates them to its 45-acre site, which includes woodland and parkland. At Chalfont St Giles you will find John Milton's cottage where the famous poet completed Paradise Lost. Now a musuem it houses an extensive collection of his works and also includes a Grade II Registered Historic Garden. Also of interest is the 13th century St Mary's Church and the award winning Amersham Musuem. As well as the sequence of interesting historical attractions there is some beautiful countryside and a long waterside stretch along the River Chess from Chesham to Chenies to enjoy.",
