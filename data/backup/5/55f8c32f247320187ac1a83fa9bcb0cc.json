  "description": "This attractive Kent based village has some fine trails through the North Downs to try. It's also a historic place with over a hundred listed buildings including some fine timber framed structures on Eyhorne Street and the noteworthy All Saints Church which dates from the 14th century. This route makes use of the North Downs Way, the Pilgrims Way and other local footpaths to create a circular walk around the village. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the North Downs Way and follow the waymarked trail south east. You then pick up a bridleway heading north east to High Wood and Salisbury Wood. Follow Drake Lane to Gotteridge and Mordenden Wood before heading west to Stockbury Wood and Chitt's Wood. This section skirts the edge of the Hucking Estate where there is a waymarked sculpture trail, a Norman church dating to 1100 AD and a fine country pub at the north western end. From here you follow woodland trails south to meet up with the North Downs Way around Eden's Hole. You can follow the trail back south east to return to Hollingbourne. Extend the walk by heading south from the village to visit one of the highlights of the area at Leeds Castle .",

It's a pub of some note with a history dating back to the 11th century when it began life as a monk\u2019s ale and cider house. The pilgrims who passed on their way to Canterbury would refresh themselves and perhaps stay the night. It is also said that James II stayed here whilst escaping the country to France. They serve high quality dishes and have a lovely garden area to sit out in on warmer days. You can find them on Upper Street at postcode ME17 1UW."

Just to the east there's the neighbouring village of Harrietsham where you can pick up the circular bluebell woodland walk. The walk includes a visit to the noteworthy Ringlestone Inn, a beautiful grade II listed pub housed in building dating back to 1533 and originally used as a hospice for monks.  For more walking ideas in the area see the North Downs Walks and the Kent Walks pages."
