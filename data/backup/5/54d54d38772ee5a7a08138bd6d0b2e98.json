  "description": "This Buckinghamshire village is located in the Chiltern Hills just west of Bledlow Ridge. The village includes a wildlife rich local nature reserve and an historic church dating to the 12th century. Local walking highlights include the fine viewpoint at Chinnor Hill and The Ridgeway National Trail which can be accessed just to the north of the village. The Chiltern Way also passes through the area. This walk from Radnage visits the Yoesdon Wood Nature Reserve which lies just to the east of the village. The reserve includes some peaceful woodland walks with lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. The steeply sloping chalk meadow has many species of butterfly, including three scarce blue species, the Adonis, chalkhill and small blue. Flora includes common spotted and fragrant orchids.",
