This area used to form part of Horley Common, and the park is managed by the local authority, Reigate and Banstead Borough Council. (Incidentally one has to question the wisdom of how these large borough councils are named. Just what affinity do the denizens of Horley (or Redhill or Tadworth for that matter) feel towards Reigate or Banstead?). The park is popular with dog walkers."

    "description": "This Surrey based town is located just north of Gatwick Airport in the borough of Reigate and Banstead. There's some nice trails in the local riverside park, views of the River Mole and three noteworthy waymarked footpaths running through the countryside surrounding the town. This walk from the town visits the Riverside Park before heading to the neighbouring village of Charlwood. Here you can visit the restored Lowfield Heath Windmill and the Glover's Wood Nature Reserve. The walk starts from the train station and heads south through the town to visit the Riverside Park. It's a popular place for a walk in the town with a nice mix of woodland interspersed with grassy glades. There's also the pretty Gatwick Steam and a small man-made lake. On the eastern side of the park you can pick up the Sussex Border Path and follow the waymarked trail west along the River Mole with Gatwick Airport just to your south. It will take you out into the countryside before reaching the village of Charlwood with its interesting Norman church. After exploring the village you continue west past the Lowfield Heath Windmill to Glover's Wood. The old Mill was originally built at  in 1737/8 and now stands on the edge of Charlwood village. It has a visitor centre and open days where you can learn all about the mill's history on a guided tour. There's some nice trails in the Glover's Wood nature reserve with streams, ponds and lots of flora and fauna to look out for on the way. After exploring the woods you can follow alternative paths back to Charlwood before returning to Horley on the Sussex Border Path.",
