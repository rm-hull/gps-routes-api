  "description": "This varied circular walk from the town takes you to several of the highlights of the area including the delightful quay at West Bay, Bothenhampton Hill, the River Brit and the River Asker. It runs for just over 4 miles on mostly flat paths, with some moderate climbs into the countryside on the return leg. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the Monarch's Way long distance footpath. Following it south takes you along the River Brit to West Bay. There's a lovely harbour here with lots of pretty boats and a nice beach. At the harbour you can cross the river and head north towards the village of Bothenhampton. Here you'll pass through a nature reserve before climbing Bothenhampton Hill. From here you follow other country paths north west to the River Asker which has some nice waterside trails. To extend your walking in the Bridport area you could pick up the coastal path along the wonderful Jurassic Coast on the West Bay to Seatown Walk. You can also try the Circular Walk from West Bay which takes you to the village of Burton Bradstock along the splendid golden sandstone cliffs. The town is also located close to the wonderful Golden Cap Estate which is one of the major highlights of the area.",
