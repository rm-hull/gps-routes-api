  "description": "This Berkshire based town is in an ideal spot for exploring the expansive Bracknell Forest and the River Blackwater Valley. The town is also well known as the based for the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the British Army's initial officer training centre. This walk in the town visits Shepherd Meadows and Sandhurst Memorial Park. These adjacent parks are located in the southern part of the town on the River Blackwater. There's some pleasant footpaths taking you around wet meadows, woodlands and the pretty Sandhurst Lake where you can look out for water loving birdlife. You can start the walk from the Memorial car park off Yorktown Road. It's located just east of the train station if you prefer to come by public transport. From the car park head south east to pass through the memorial park before picking up the Blackwater Valley Footpath into Shepherd Meadows. There's some lovely wildflowers and birds such as kestrels, warblers, spotted flycatchers and woodpeckers to see here. To extend the walk continue south east along the Blackwater Valley Footpath to neighbouring Camberley and Frimley where you can explore the wildlife rich Frimley Hatches Nature Reserve. You can continue your walk by heading west to visit Horseshoe Lake, Tri Lakes Country Park and Finchampstead Ridges where there's some lovely National Trust woodland and heathland.",
