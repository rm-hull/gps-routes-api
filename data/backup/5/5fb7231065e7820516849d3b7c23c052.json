  "description": "Follow the Great Ridge from Mam Tor to Lose Hill on one of the most popular walks in the Peak District. Although the walk reaches a height of well over 1600ft, it is not as challenging as you might think because the start point for walk is already in an elevated position. The walk runs for a distance of about 2.5 miles, so roughly 5 miles there and back. It's a very beautiful area with the views over the Peak District stunning for the duration of the route. You can see the Hope Valley, the Edale Valley and several of the prominent fells. The area is also geologically fascintating with several 320 million year old Carboniferous rocks. Start the walk from the National Trust Mam Nick car park. It's located just to the south west of Mam Tor on the Sparrowpit Buxton A623.A6 Road. From here it's a short but steep climb to the 517m (1,696 ft) summit of Mam Tor. The route then passes along the Great Ridge, descending to Hollins Cross before passing Back Tor and finishing on Lose Hill. It's about a 2.5 mile walk so 5 miles in total. This ridge walk is located very close to both Edale and Castleton so you could start your walk from either of these popular Peak District villages. To extend your walk you can visit the nearby Winnats Pass with its towering limestone pinnacles. You could also pick up the Pennine Way around Edale and climb towards Kinder Scout. If you head west from the car park you can climb across Rushup Edge and visit Lord's Seat at 550 m (1,804 ft).",
