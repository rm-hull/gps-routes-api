  "description": "This walk visits the National Trust's Dollar Glen located in the Ochils of Clackmannanshire. There's some lovely woodland trails with pretty burns and rushing waterfalls to see here. Also on the site are the striking ruins of the medieval Castle Campbell which dates from the 16th century. You can enjoy great views over the area from the elevated structure. The scenic wooded gorge is great for wildlife with woodpecker, dipper and nuthatch to look out for as you make your way around the site. To continue your walking in the area head west to Alva Glen where there's more pretty waterfalls and access to the Ochil Hills Woodland Park.",
