  "description": "This walk visits the National Trust's Dollar Glen located in the Ochils of Clackmannanshire. There's some lovely woodland trails with pretty burns and rushing waterfalls to see here. Also on the site are the striking ruins of the medieval Castle Campbell which dates from the 16th century. You can enjoy great views over the area from the elevated structure. The scenic wooded gorge is great for wildlife with woodpecker, dipper and nuthatch to look out for as you make your way around the site. To continue your walking in the area head west to Alva Glen where there's more pretty waterfalls and access to the Ochil Hills Woodland Park.",

      "content": "To the south of the town of Dollar you can pick up the Devon Way and enjoy a riverside walk along the River Devon. You could follow the trail towards Alloa where you could enjoy a waterside walk around the lake in Gartmorn Dam Country Park. There's also nice walks along the river through Glendevon where you can visit a series of pretty reservoirs and explore the adjacent Glen Sherup. To the west there's Dunfermline where there's nice walks around Townhill Country Park and Lochore Meadows Country Park. These local parks have a good selection of walking and cycling trails to try. The splendid Loch Leven and the remote Loch Fitty are also not too far away. To the west there's Tillicoultry Glen and Mill Glen where you can learn about the interesting industrial past of the area."
