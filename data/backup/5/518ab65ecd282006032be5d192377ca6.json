  "description": "This RSPB bird reserve in Hoddesdon has some nice nature trails to try. There's a number of lakes and other waterside trails along the River Lea which runs through the area. Look out for birds including herons, kingfishers, snipe, green sandpipers, shovelers, gadwalls and tufted ducks. The reserve has a car park at the southern end but the Rye House railway station is located right next to the reserve so its easy to come by public transport too. To extend the walk you could follow the River Lea north to Ware , passing more lakes around Stansted Abbotts on the way. Heading south would take you towards Nazing Mead, Clayton Hill Country Park and Waltham Abbey .",
