  "description": "This walk visits the ruins of a 12th century abbey near Hollington in Staffordshire. There are substantial remains at the site with towering fragments of its 13th century church, infirmary and 14th century abbot's lodging. The walk starts from the abbey where there is some parking in a layby. You can then enjoy a walk along Croxden Lane which runs between the abbey ruins. It's a very picturesque area with the abbey surrounded by some lovely green fields. There are a number of information boards dotted around which will tell you all about the interesting history of the area. You can also see several of the original fruit trees from the abbey and  the lake they would have held carp in. After exploring the site the circular walk then heads to Quarry Bank and the village of Hollington before returning to the abbey. On the country trails there are nice views over the surrounding countryside back to the abbey.",
