  "description": "This nice 3 mile circular walk around the Berkshire village of Pangbourne includes waterside stretches along the River Thames and the River Pang. Start the walk from Panbourne train station and then head east along the Thames Path to Pangbourne Meadow. It's a delightful spot which is great for picnics and also hosts the annual Village fete in June. After passing along the pretty meadow the route turns south, following a footpath along the Sul Brook towards Sulham Woods . You can take a short detour south and visit the attractive woods which contain a series of waymarked trails. This walk heads west to meet up with the River Pang where you can follow a path along the river back to the village. To extend your walking in the area you could continue east along the Thames towards Purley on Thames and visit Mapledurham House . The estate is a lovely place for a stroll and includes a 15th century watermill. Around here you can also pick up the long distance Chiltern Way which runs through the area. If you head west along the path it will take you towards Basildon Park . Here you will find 4 different waymarked trails taking you through 400 acres of parkland and woodland.",
