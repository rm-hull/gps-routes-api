  "description": "At 200 acres, Linn Park is the second largest park in the city of Glasgow.  There are lovely woodland and riverside walks and the park is also suitable for cyclists - please take care on certain sections and on loose fill paths. Linn Park consists of a variety of habitats including grassland, scrub land, deciduous and coniferous woodland and riverbank. Highlights in the park include the beautiful waterfall on the river and the 19th century Linn House. There is also an adventure playground for the children and an 18 hole golf course. The park rises to a height of 85 metres so there are lovely views from the high points.",
