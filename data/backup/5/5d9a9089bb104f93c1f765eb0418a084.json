    "description": "This circular walk follows the Otterburn Village Trail around this Northumberland village. It runs for just over 2 miles with nice views of the surrounding countryside on the way. The walk starts in the village and follows the trail north along the waters of the pretty Otter Burn. This takes you up to Otterburn Hall, a country house situated in 500 acres (200 ha) of deer park and woodland. It's an attractive building, Grade-II listed with English Heritage, and rated with four-stars by the Architectural Association School of Architecture. From the hall you head east and then south to follow the trail through Girsonfield and back into the village. Other interesting sites near the village include the site of the Battle of Otterburn. The battle took place in 1388 as part of the continuing border skirmishes between the Scots and English. Percy's Cross which marks the battlefield can be found about a mile north west of the village. There is a public car park off the main road and a short footpath to the cross. To continue your walking in the area head north to explore the Otterburn Ranges around Byrness. There's miles of walking trails taking you to the source of the River Coquet on the border with Scotland.",
