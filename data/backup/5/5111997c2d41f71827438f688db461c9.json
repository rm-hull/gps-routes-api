  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk to the summit of this distinctive fell in the Lake District. Alfred Wainwright said of Helm Crag: 'The virtues of Helm Crag have not been lauded enough. It gives an exhilarating little climb, a brief essay in real mountaineering, and, in a region where all is beautiful, it makes a notable contribution to the natural charms and attractions of Grasmere'. The route runs for a distance of about 4 miles along a series of public footpaths. The ascent of Helm Crag is popular with walkers as it begins from the lovely town of Grasmere and is an easy/moderate climb. The walk begins at the centre of Grasmere and follows the Easedale Road to Lancrigg, passing Easedale Beck on the way. You then follow footpaths to the summit of Helm Crag, passing White Crag on the way. The summit has wonderful views over Grasmere and towards the Helvellyn range. You will also see two rocky outcrops known as The Lamb & Lion and the striking 'Howitzer' which is the high point on Helm Crag. From the summit you soon reach Helmside where you descend back to Grasmere on country lanes.",
