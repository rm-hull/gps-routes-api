  "description": "Visit this spectacular waterfall on this short walk in Llanberis in the Snowdonia National Park. Also known as Ceunant Mawr Waterfall these lovely falls drop over a hundred feet into the Afon Arddu. It's a short walk to the falls from the centre of Llanberis. A footpath off Church Road leads to the falls where there is an observation point. You can continue your walk by following the riverside path along the Afon Arddu or visiting the woodland of Coed Victoria. To continue your walking in Llanberis you can visit the beautiful Padarn Country Park. Here you can enjoy a lakeside stroll along Llyn Padarn and catch the Llanberis Lake Railway. There's also the splendid zig zag path at Llyn Peris to climb.",

      "content": "The longer Llanberis Lake Walk starts from the lakeside car park and visits the falls. It also visits the Coed Victoria Woods and the photogenic Dolbadarn Castle which dates from the early 13th century. On the fringes of the country park there's the fascinating Dinorwic Quarry to explore. At one time the quarry was the second largest slate quarry in the world. You can pick up the tramway trail footpath across the site just north of the visitor centre. The quarry is one of the significant sites on the Snowdonia Slate Trail which runs through the area. The circular long distance trail can be used to visit several of the other historic mining areas located in the World Heritage Site. Heading north along the trail would take you to Bethesda where you could visit the Penrhyn Quarry which was the largest slate quarry in the world during the 19th century. Heading south along the trail would take you to Dorothea Quarry where you'll find the remains of the old mining houses and a series of scenic lakes including Llyn Nantlle Uchaf. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
