  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Rothesay to Ettrick Bay on the stunning Isle of Bute. The route uses part of the West Island Way and other quiet country roads to take you to the picturesque Ettrick Bay on the western side of the island. Start the walk from the ferry in Rothesay and head west to pick up the West Island Way. The trail will take you north west towards Port Bannatyne and Kames Bay. Roads then lead you west to Colmac Bridge and the St Colmac Church ruins before coming to the beautiful Ettrick Bay where you'll find a lovely beach and views over the Kyles of Bute. You can follow footpaths south along the bay before joining country roads to Ballianlay. Here you turn east, passing the pretty Greenan Loch before returning to Rothesay.",
