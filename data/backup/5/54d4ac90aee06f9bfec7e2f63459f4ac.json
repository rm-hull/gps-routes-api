    "description": "These ancient woods near the village of Silverstone have some nice footpaths to try. The site includes oak and conifer plantations with plenty of birds and butterflies to look out for as you make your way through the woods. You can access the woods from the car park just off the A43, south west of Silverstone. To extend your woodland walking head north to Bucknell Woods . The woods are only a short walk away and are another good spot for seeing the Wood White butterfly in summer and lots of bluebells in the spring. Just to the east you can pick up the Grafton Way long distance trail. The trail runs through nearby Towcester and is a great way of exploring the Northamptonshire countryside.",
