  "description": "This walk visits Oulston Reservoir in the Hambleton district of North Yorkshire. The walk starts from Oulston village, located in the Howardian Hills AONB. From the pretty village you can pick up a section of the Foss Walk and follow it east to the reservoir. It's a very tranquil area with lovely views across the water to the surrounding woodland. To continue your walk head a short distance north to visit the 12th century Newburgh Priory and Byland Abbey. The historic sites includes atmospheric ruins and some lovely grounds to explore.",
