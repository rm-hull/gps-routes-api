  "description": "The Hampshire village of Warsash is located in a lovely spot on the River Hamble and close to Southampton Water. It's a popular place for sailing with several yachts moored in the river here. The village is also notable as the home to the Warsash Maritime Academy, which provides training for Merchant Navy Officers from around the world. You can catch a ferry over the river to visit the neighbouring village of Hamble-le-Rice on the opposite side. This walk from the village takes you south along the River Hamble and Southampton Water to visit Hook Lake and the lovely Titchfield Haven Nature Reserve. The coastal reserve is one of the highlights of the area and located just a few miles from the village. The walk starts in the village at the car park next to the river. From here you can pick up the Solent Way and follow the waymarked trail south past the piers to the pretty Hook Lake. The route then continues past the Solent Breezes Caravan site before passing Meon to arrive at Titchfield Haven. The delightful reserve includes 369 acres of river, fen, pools, reedbed and meadow with lots of birds to see. Look out for Reed Warblers, Bearded Tits, Water rails and Bittern around the reedbeds and Otters by the River Meon. After exploring the reserve the route returns to Warsash on the same paths.",

      "content": "The River Hamble Walk also starts in the village. This takes you north to Lower Swanick, passing Holly Hill Woodland Park on the way. The attractive park includes woodland trails, lakes and some ornamental exotic species of tree. If you catch the ferry over the river you could visit Hamble Common in Hamble-le-Rice. The commons is a fine place for walks with ponds, heathland, oak woodland, meadow, salt-marsh, mudflats and a shingle beach on the River Hamble. Just to the east of the village you can try the Fareham Walk which climbs to the distinctive Nelson Monument on Portsdown Hill.There's also a visit to Fort Nelson which has a fascinating military history. From the elevated position of the fort there are excellent views to the coast. Head east along the coast path from Titchfield Haven and you will soon come to Alver Valley Country Park in Gosport and Lee on Solent. The 500 acre park has some nice trails along the River Alver, another wildlife rich nature reserve, a cafe and cycle paths. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
