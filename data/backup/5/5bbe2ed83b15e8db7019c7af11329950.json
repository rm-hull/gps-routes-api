    "description": "The Hampshire village of Warsash is located in a lovely spot on the River Hamble and close to Southampton Water. It's a popular place for sailing with several yachts moored in the river here. The village is also notable as the home to the Warsash Maritime Academy, which provides training for Merchant Navy Officers from around the world. You can catch a ferry over the river to visit the neighbouring village of Hamble-le-Rice on the opposite side. This walk from the village takes you south along the River Hamble and Southampton Water to visit Hook Lake and the lovely Titchfield Haven Nature Reserve. The coastal reserve is one of the highlights of the area and located just a few miles from the village. The walk starts in the village at the car park next to the river. From here you can pick up the Solent Way and follow the waymarked trail south past the piers to the pretty Hook Lake. The route then continues past the Solent Breezes Caravan site before passing Meon to arrive at Titchfield Haven. The delightful reserve includes 369 acres of river, fen, pools, reedbed and meadow with lots of birds to see. Look out for Reed Warblers, Bearded Tits, Water rails and Bittern around the reedbeds and Otters by the River Meon. After exploring the reserve the route returns to Warsash on the same paths.",
