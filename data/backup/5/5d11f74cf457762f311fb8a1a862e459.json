You can also enjoy a stroll in the extensive pleasure grounds which include a lake, a 19th century summer house, a maze, specimen trees and wild orchids. Head into the 875 acre estate on the public footpath and you will find peaceful woodland and a deer park with a herd of 350 fallow deer. There is also an 18th century dovecote and ice house. Inside the house there is a Great Hall and Long Gallery with fine furniture and paintings.",
