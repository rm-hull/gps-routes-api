  "description": "Explore the parkland and gardens surrounding this Elizabethan House near Storrington and Amberley. The gardens include a four-acre Walled Garden, herbaceous borders, a glasshouse, vegetable garden, orchard and a 1920s Wendy House. You can also enjoy a stroll in the extensive pleasure grounds which include a lake, a 19th century summer house, a maze, specimen trees and wild orchids. Head into the 875 acre estate on the public footpath and you will find peaceful woodland and a deer park with a herd of 350 fallow deer. There is also an 18th century dovecote and ice house. Inside the house there is a Great Hall and Long Gallery with fine furniture and paintings.",

      "content": "The house is located just to the west of Storrington. The picturesque little town has a pretty mill pond and good access to the South Downs which is located just to the south. The circular Storrington Walk takes you onto the downs, climbing to Kithurst Hill where there's fine views to the coast from the summit. Rackham Woods can be found just to the west of the house. The circular route also visits the viewpoint at Rackham Hill and the fascinating Iron Age Urnfields containing the cremated remains of prehistory people in clay pots. You can also pick up the Amberley Circular Walk and enjoy riverside paths along the River Arun before a visit to the fascintating Amberley Working Museum. For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks and South Downs Walks pages."
