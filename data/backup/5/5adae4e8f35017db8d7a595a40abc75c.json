Over time, it became anglicised to Courtmacsherry.\nOnce the summer residence of the Earl of Shannon, Courtmacsherry boasts exotic trees, shrubs, and woods planted around the village.

Their cottages still overlook the harbour today.\nThe village, situated along the south shore of Courtmacsherry Bay, is flanked by dense woods on rising ground. These woods, planted by the Earl of Shannon, extend eastwards to the sea, culminating at Wood Point. Between the village and the Point, trees stretch to the water's edge, with natural bathing coves scattered along the coastline."
