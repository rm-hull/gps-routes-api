Its name, \"Cuirt Mhic Sheafraidh\" in Irish, translates to MacSherry\u2019s Court, reflecting its early settlers. Over time, it became anglicised to Courtmacsherry. Once the summer residence of the Earl of Shannon, Courtmacsherry boasts exotic trees, shrubs, and woods planted around the village. During the Victorian era, it flourished as a holiday destination for Cork city residents."

The village, situated along the south shore of Courtmacsherry Bay, is flanked by dense woods on rising ground. These woods, planted by the Earl of Shannon, extend eastwards to the sea, culminating at Wood Point. Between the village and the Point, trees stretch to the water's edge, with natural bathing coves scattered along the coastline."
