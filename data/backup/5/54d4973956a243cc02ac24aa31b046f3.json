  "description": "This easy 4 mile circular walk explores the countryside surrounding the village of Upper Arley in Worcestershire. It's a lovely, varied route with riverside paths, woodland trails, reservoirs and attractive farmland to enjoy. The walk starts on the river in the village, where you can pick up the Severn Valley Railway Walk and follow it south along the Severn. It will soon lead you to Trimpley Reservoir where you can follow a path between the river and the upper and lower reservoirs. The river and reservoir are great for wildlife watching with kingfishers, grey herons and goosanders to look out for on the water. The route then leaves the river to follow the woodland trails north through Eymore Wood. The final section then takes you through the farmland to the north of the village before finishing back at the riverside. After your exercise head to the Harbour Inn for refreshments. The 200 year old pub is located next to Arley Station on the western side of the river. There's a nice outdoor seating area to relax in during the warmer months. On the other side of the river there's the delightful riverside tearooms where you can also sit out and enjoy the views of the river and the railway. To continue your walking you could follow the Severn Valley Railway Walk south to Bewdley. You could also head to Arley Station and enjoy a ride on the fine old heritage railway itself.",
