  "description": "This walk visits Garvagh Forest in the village of Garvagh in County Londonderry. The woods are located on the western side of the village and include several peaceful walking trails and mountain bike tracks. All the trails are family friendly with a green trail, blue trail, red trail and a short yellow skills loop with various rock gardens, rollers and rock drops to practice on. In the spring there are also carpets of pretty bluebells. There are also nice views of the Agivey River and an unusual folly in the shape of a pyramid to see. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Garvagh Forest. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
