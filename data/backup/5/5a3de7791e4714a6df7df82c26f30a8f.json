    "description": "This forest holiday park is part of the wider Cropton Forest in the North York Moors. The beautiful and serene woodland is located in the heart of the National Park. The forest covers an area of approximately 800 acres and is known for its peaceful surroundings and stunning natural beauty. The forest is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers, as it offers a variety of activities and experiences. Visitors can take part in hiking, cycling, and horseback riding on the many trails that wind through the forest, and there are also several designated picnic areas where visitors can relax and enjoy the scenery. One of the most unique features of Keldy Forest is the range of accommodation options available to visitors. There are a number of luxurious cabins and lodges scattered throughout the forest, which offer a comfortable and peaceful retreat for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life. In addition to its natural beauty and recreational opportunities, Keldy Forest is also home to a diverse range of wildlife, including deer, badgers, foxes, and a variety of bird species. The immediate surrounding forest also has miles of fine walking trails and mountain bike trails. Other nearby highlights include the natural amphitheatre at the Hole of Horcum and the long distance Tabular Hills Walk which runs along the southern edge of the forest. This waymarked trail is a fine way of further exploring the surrounding area on foot. For cyclists there's Whitby to Robin Hoods Bay on the Cinder Track route and Bransdale Loop to try.
