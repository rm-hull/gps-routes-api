  "description": "This walk takes you to one of the finest beaches in Cornwall from the town of Padstow. This is the most direct route, taking you through the countryside to Trevone Bay before following the South West Coast Path to Harlyn Bay. It's a lovely spot with sand dunes, yellow sand, pebbles and lots of little rock pools. It's a popular area for surfers but also a great spot for walkers with the option of continuing along the coast path to Stepper Point or Trevose Head where there's a lighthouse and wonderful cliff top paths.",

      "content": "One nice idea is to catch the ferry over the river to Rock on the other side of the estuary from Padstow. Here you can pick up the Rock to Polzeath Walk which heads north along Daymer Bay to the lovely beach at Polzeath. Here you can pick up the Polzeath to Port Isaac Walk and visit the noteworthy village of Port Isaac. The picturesque settlement has been made famous by ITV's 'Doc Martin', featuring Martin Clunes. The route passes Prideaux Place just to the north west of Padstow. There's delightful grounds and a deer park surrounding this historic 16th century house. The circular Constantine Bay to Harlyn Bay Walk starts at the Constantine Bay car park. It visits Trevose Head before heading inland to the village of the same name. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
