  "description": "This walk explores the countryside around the West Sussex village of Rudgwick. The village is located just west of Horsham in the Low Weald, near to the border with Surrey. Rudgwick includes a noteworthy 14th century church and a fine 16th century pub to relax in after your exercise. Two waymarked footpaths pass the village in the shape of the Downs Link and the Sussex Border Path. These waymarked trails are a good way of exploring the area on foot. This walk from the village takes you east through the fields towards the pretty Furnace Lakes. On the way there's lots of woodland trails and fine countryside views to enjoy.",
