  "description": "These expansive woods near Hereford include mountain bike trails and a Butterfly Trail for walkers. The area covers about 850 acres so there's plenty of different trails to try. It's great for wildlife with over 600 recorded species of butterfly and moth. Families can enjoy nice easy walking trails with picnic benches to rest and refresh yourselves. The Haugh Wood Butterfly Trails are particularly popular. You can follow the waymarked trails and look out for the information boards which show you the different types of butterfly you may see on your walk. You can pick up all the trails from Haugh Wood car park in the centre of the woods. There's lots of footpaths to choose from including the Three Choirs Way long distance trail which runs right through the wood. The Wye Valley Walk also skirts the western edge of the woods. You could actually follow the waymarked path from Hereford all the way to the woods as an alternative route. The woods also link with the Mordiford Loop. The circular trail takes you through the orchards, woodland and countryside surrounding the village.",

They do excellent food and have a garden area for finer days. You can find the pub at postcode HR1 4PE for your sat navs. The New Inn is also nearby in the village. The friendly pub also does good food and has a large lawned garden area for outdoor refreshments."

      "content": "The woods are located close to the pretty little village of Fownhope. Here you can start the circular Fownhope Walk which visits the woodland in Fownhope Park before heading to Haugh Wood. It's a nice way of visiting the site from the nearby settlement. The Mordiford Dragon Trail is another great local option. The short walk celebrates Mordiford\u2019s fascinating Dragon legend, taking you past a series of wooden sculptures which illustrate the tale of the dragon. On the south eastern side of the woods you can pick up the Woolhope Circular Walk. The waymarked trail explores the countryside around the pretty village. For more walking ideas in the area see the Herefordshire Walks page."
