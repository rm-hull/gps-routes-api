  "description": "Enjoy miles of mountain bike trails and footpaths in this expansive forest in Perthshire. This 3 mile circular walk take you around the Lime Craig Trail from the excellent visitor centre in Aberfoyle. There's attractive oak woodland, waterfalls and a steep climb to Lime Craig. From the viewpoint there are excellent views of Ben Lomond, Ben Venue, Ben Ledi, the Carse of Stirling and the Campsie Fells. The area is great for wildlife too. Look out for red squirrels and crossbills as you make your way through the woods. There's lots of other trails to try with more details from the Lodge Visitor Centre. This route is designed for walkers but there's plenty of trails for mountain bikers to try. For example you can follow the National Cycle Route 7 to Loch Venachar and Loch Drunkie through the Archay Forest from the centre. If you head north west you can visit Loch Achray and the wonderful Loch Katrine. A few miles east of Aberfoyle you will find Inchmahome Priory on Lake Mentieth. It's a special place with the 13th century ruins of the priory surrounded by woodland trails. Just to the west of the visitor centre you can pick up the cycling and walking trails along Loch Ard. The Rob Roy Way long distance footpath also passes through Aberfoyle so you can pick this up to head deeper into the forest. If you were to head north east along the path it would take you to Callander where you can visit the beautiful Falls of Leny and Loch Lubnaig. If you are looking for a more challenging walk then you could climb to Ben Ledi for fabulous views over the park.",
