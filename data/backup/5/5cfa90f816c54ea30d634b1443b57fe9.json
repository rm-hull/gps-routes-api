  "description": "This coastal Gwynedd village is located just south of Porthmadog in the Snowdonia National Park. The picturesque settlement includes a lovely harbour and some fine beaches. This walk in the village takes you west along a section of the Llyn Coastal Path to Ynys Cyngar, Samson's Bay and the neighbouring village of Morfa Bychan. On the way you can enjoy views over the Afon Glaslyn to the Morfa Harlech National Nature Reserve. There's also views to the mountains of Snowdonia which form a fine backdrop to the walk. The walk finishes on Black Rock Sands where you can enjoy a wide sandy beach, sand dunes, a large multi-coloured headland rock, low-tide caves, rock pools, and a variety of marine life. You can extend the walk by continuing west to Criccieth where you can visit the 13th century Criccieth Castle ruins and the grave of former Prime Minister David Lloyd George.",
