It can only carry two cars and is surprisingly busy, with it being the only crossing of the river between Great Yarmouth and Norwich. The Ferry Inn public house can be seen on the other side (the north side) of the river."

  "description": "This Broads village is a lovely place to start a walk with miles of riverside trails and some pleasant footpaths to follow through the surrounding countryside. This route from the village uses sections of the Wherryman's Way and the Weavers' Way to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Wherryman's Way and follow the waymarked footpath east along the River Yare to the Berney Marshes where there's lots of birdlife to see. In this area there are also nice views across the river to the historic Burgh Castle on the other side. The route then picks up the Weavers' Way and follows the path along the river to Breydon Pump with views of the lovely Breydon Water as you go. The route then heads west to visit the neighbouring villages of Halvergate and Freethorpe, passing picturesque mills on the way. The final section follows some flat country lanes to Limpenhoe Hill before turning east to return to the village.",
