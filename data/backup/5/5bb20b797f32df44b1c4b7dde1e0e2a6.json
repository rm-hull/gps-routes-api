  "description": "With its mainline train station, beautiful lake and excellent facilities Windermere is a popular tourist destination for walkers. One of the best walks is the Windermere Way long distance trail. This takes you all the way around the lake visiting a series of pretty villages and hills with excellent viewpoints across the water. The easy climb to Orrest Head is also a favourite. The fine viewpoint is located very close to the town centre and train/bus staion. You can also walk to the bottom of the hill and visit the village of Bowness where you can catch boats from the quay. This nice walk from the train station visits two of the lesser known fells of the area. It heads south east through quiet roads before climbing to School Knott hill. The hill stands at 760 feet (230 m) and offers a view of four sections of Lake Windermere. After taking in the views you continue to the pretty School Knott Tarn before climbing to Grandsire Hill where there are more fine views to enjoy. Around here you can pick up the Dales Way long distance footpath and follow it to Staveley via Brackenthwaite.",
