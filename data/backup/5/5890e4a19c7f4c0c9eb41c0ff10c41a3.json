  "description": "This fabulous attraction has numerous waterside cycling and walking paths taking you around the park's 150 lakes. There are 40 square miles to explore within the water park but with the Thames Path National Trail and National Cycle Route 45 running through the park there is great scope for continuing your exercise along these trails (bike hire is available in the park). There is a wide variety of wildlife to see too - look out for otters, water voles and beavers. The western section of the park shown in the map is located between Swindon and Cirencester. There is also an eastern section located near Fairford and Lechlade . Our Fairford Walk starts from the town and explores that section of the park before heading to Lechlade for a stroll along the Thames. To extend your walking in the area you can try the Cricklade Circular Walk and explore the area around the pretty town. If you follow the Thames Path in a north westerly direction it will take you to the Source of the Thames near Kemble .",
