  "description": "This Dorset based village sits in a rural spot on the River Frome near to the county town of Dorchester. Two major long distance walking trails pass through the village and there's also a National Nature Reserve a short walk away. This circular walk from the village visits the Hog Cliff Bottom Nature Reserve before a stroll along the River Frome. The walk starts at the railway station where you can pick up the Wessex Ridgeway long distance footpath. Follow the trail north east before heading east along public bridleways to Ford Hill and Hog Cliff Bottom. You can follow a circular bridle path around the attractive site where there are some lovely country views and lots of wildlife to see. After exploring the reserve the route then heads to Langcombe Bottom where you cross the railway line and the river at Little Cruxton. The route then picks up a section of the Macmillan Way and follows it north to the river and the village.",

      "content": "The Frome Valley Trail runs through the village providing an opportunity to continue your walking through the Frome Valley. You could follow the trail north to the idyllic village of Evershot. The village has strong connections with Thomas Hardy and includes a noteworthy 16th century pub and walking trails to the nearby Melbury Park Estate. Heading south east along the trail would take you into Dorchester via the Muckleford Nature Reserve and the village of Bradford Peverell. Just to the north east is the neighbouring village of Sydling St Nicholas. It's a delightful place with thatched 18th century cottages on a chocolate box High Street, a noteworthy 15th century church and a fine centuries old pub. There's also nice walks along the pretty Sydling Water here. You can follow the Wessex Ridgeway Trail north east for about 2 miles to reach the village."
