  "description": "Enjoy a nice easy canal walk from Alrewas to Fradley Junction and then onto the village of Fradley. The route first follows the Trent and Mersey Canal to Fradley junction before turning south along the Coventry Canal to take you into Fradley. It's a very beautiful section of the canal, with lots of barges, old stone bridges and lovely tree lined towpaths. The walk starts in the little village of Alrewas, near Lichfield in Staffordshire. You can pick up the canal towpath on the western side of the village and follow it west to Fradley Reservoir and Fradley Junction. Here you'll find a number of nice old buildings including the 18th century Swan Inn, two shops and two cafes. Fradley Pool\u00a0Nature Reserve\u00a0is adjacent to the junction, and is a great place for bird watching. On the Trent and Mersey, the junction is in the middle of a five-lock flight, with Junction Lock just below it and Middle Lock a little further above it. At the junction you can pick up the Coventry Canal and follow it south east toward Fradley village. Here you can stop for refreshments before returning on the same paths to Alrewas. Alrewas is also home to the National Memorial Arboretum where you can continue your walking. There are 30,000 trees in the 150 acre Arboretum, forming a unique living tribute to those who have served and continue to serve our country.",
