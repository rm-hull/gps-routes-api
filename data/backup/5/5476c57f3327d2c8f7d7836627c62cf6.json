Provision was made to increase the capacity of the reservoir if necessary but although this was not done, a few years ago a 20% increase was achieved by raising the levels of the outflows. The reservoir is used for recreational purposes including fishing, boating and walking around the circumference."

This farm entrance with its old millstones and spacious barn dates from a time when agriculture was profitable and tourism unheard-of. Llys-y-fran means court of the raven (or crow, or rook)."
