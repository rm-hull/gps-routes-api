The remnant of a medieval Great Field, which was ploughed in narrow strips and allocated to the villagers in such a way that all would share alike in the good land and the bad. The photo does not do justice to how humpy the ground was, but the wavy \"horizon\" gives some idea. It is now being managed as permanent grassland with the intention of increasing its wildlife diversity."

  "description": "This small Cambridgeshire based village lies just to the west of the famous university town of Cambridge. This circular walk from the village explores the Coton Countryside Reserve. The reserve is located just south east of the village and includes a number of footpaths taking you to various habitats. You can start your walk in the village centre and follow the High Street East along a section of the Harcamlow Way. You then head south into the reserve where you can pick up a pleasant path along the Bin Brook. Keep your eyes peeled for a variety of birds and muntjac deer which can often be seen around Coton. The first part of the walk runs along The Coton Footpath, a recreational cycle or walk from Cambridge to Coton. You could pick up it and head east to visit the River Cam and the famous college buildings in the city. Just a mile to the north west there's another highlight of the area at the historic Madingley Hall. Here you will find some beautiful \u2018Capability\u2019 Brown landscaped gardens surrounding a fine 16th century manor house. It's a great place to extend your walking around Coton.",
