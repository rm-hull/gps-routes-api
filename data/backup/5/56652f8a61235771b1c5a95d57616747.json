    "description": "This nice circular walk takes you around 'The Walks' urban park before a riverside stroll along the Great Ouse. The Norfolk market town is a great place for a walk with wonderful architecture, a fascinating history and lovely riverside paths. The walk starts in the park next to the train station in the centre of town. The lovely 42 acre park has nice surfaced footpaths, a 15th century chapel, beautiful landscaping, a children\u2019s play area, toilets and a cafe. After strolling through the park the route heads through the streets to the quay on the river. You then head towards South Lynn before crossing the bridge and following the paths along the western side of the river through West Lynn. Here you can catch the ferry which runs about every 20 mins from 7am to 6pm (excluding Sundays). You can then retrace your steps back to the park. On your way through the town look out for the fine Custom House tourist information centre which was originally built in 1683. The St Nicholas's Chapel, built between 1145 and 1420, and the Burkitt Court Almshouses are other notable architectural highlights. If you would like to extend your walking then there are several long distance trails running through the area. For example the Peter Scott Walk starts in King's Lynn. It will take you along the coastline of the Wash to Sir Peter Scott's lighthouse near Sutton Bridge. The Nar Valley Way also starts in the town and will take you along the River Nar to Gressenhall. A few miles to the north east of the town you can visit Roydon Common . Here you'll find nice trails taking you around a large area of heathland and woodland with Dartmoor Ponies to look out for. Just to the south of the common you can visit Bawsey Country Park .",
