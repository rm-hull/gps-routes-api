  "description": "This nice circular walk takes you around 'The Walks' urban park before a riverside stroll along the Great Ouse. The Norfolk market town is a great place for a walk with wonderful architecture, a fascinating history and lovely riverside paths. The walk starts in the park next to the train station in the centre of town. The lovely 42 acre park has nice surfaced footpaths, a 15th century chapel, beautiful landscaping, a children\u2019s play area, toilets and a cafe. After strolling through the park the route heads through the streets to the quay on the river. You then head towards South Lynn before crossing the bridge and following the paths along the western side of the river through West Lynn. Here you can catch the ferry which runs about every 20 mins from 7am to 6pm (excluding Sundays). You can then retrace your steps back to the park. On your way through the town look out for the fine Custom House tourist information centre which was originally built in 1683. The St Nicholas's Chapel, built between 1145 and 1420, and the Burkitt Court Almshouses are other notable architectural highlights. If you would like to extend your walking then there are several long distance trails running through the area. For example the Peter Scott Walk starts in King's Lynn. It will take you along the coastline of the Wash to Sir Peter Scott's lighthouse near Sutton Bridge. The Nar Valley Way also starts in the town and will take you along the River Nar to Gressenhall. A few miles to the north east of the town you can visit Roydon Common. Here you'll find nice trails taking you around a large area of heathland and woodland with Dartmoor Ponies to look out for. Just to the south of the common you can visit Bawsey Country Park .",

There's a good menu and quay-side outdoor tables for warmer days. You can also take in the stunning views across the river from the first-floor bar area. You can find it at South Quay with a postcode of PE30 5DT for your sat navs."

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "One nice idea is to venture into neighbouring Cambridgeshire on foot while visiting two rivers and the coast on the way. You could follow the Peter Scott Walk north along the Ouse to The Wash and then head west along the coastal path to link with the River Nene. The waymarked Nene Way can then be followed south into Wisbech. For more interesting local history head a couple of miles north east of the town to visit Castle Rising. Here you'll find the ruins of an English Heritage owned castle surrounded by impressive earthworks. The pretty little village of the same name is also well worth exploring. Just to the north of the village you'll also find Sandringham Country Park. The expansive park surrounds the Queen's famous country retreat. In the park you'll find miles of excellent woodland and parkland walking trails. On the western side of the estate there's also the interesting village of Wolferton. Here you can visit the noteworthy Wolferton Railway Station. The now disused station was well known during the 1800\u2019s through its association with the Royal Family who used the station because of its proximity to Sandringham House. There are also trails to pick up around the Dersingham Bog Nature Reserve in this area. The reserve is part of the wider Sandringham Royal Estate and includes attractive heathland with interesting flora and fauna to see. A few miles south east of the town is another of the historical highlights of the area at Castle Acre. Here you'll find the atmospheric ruins of and 11th century castle and priory. There's also some lovely waterside trails along the River Nar through the picture postcard village. The attractive village of Great Massingham and the historic Houghton Hall gardens are also located in this area. A few miles to the south you will find Shouldham Warren where there are two colour coded waymarked walks. The nature reserve includes beautiful pine woodlands and a fine Rhododendron Avenue. The associated village is also worth a detour from the route with its pretty village green and 14th century church to see. For more walking ideas around King's Lynn see the Norfolk Walks page."
