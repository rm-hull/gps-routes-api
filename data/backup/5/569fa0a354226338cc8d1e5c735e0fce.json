Opened in 1914, the Burncrooks Reservoir was constructed around one of the feeder streams to the River Endrick\"."

    "description": "This walk takes you to the Whangie hill and then on to the lovely Burncrooks Reservoir in the Kilpatrick Hills. You can start your walk from the Queen's view car park which sits on the A809 north of Auchengillan. Then follow the footpaths west from here to visit the Whangie. This unusual hill includes interesting rock formations and a narrow chasm through which you can walk. From here head south along paths which will take you down to the reservoir.\nThere are good well maintained walking paths running around the lake with fine views to the Luss hills, Arrochar Alps and Ben Lomond .\nAfter following the circular trail around the reservoir you can then follow ither paths up to the trig point on Auchineden Hill. You then retrace your steps east to return to the car park. You can extend the walk by heading south to visit the nearby Kilmannan Reservoir where there are more nice trails to try. Loch Humphrey is also just a few miles south west.",
