  "description": "This walk explores the Carneddau mountain range in the Snowdonia National Park. You'll visit the peaks of Carnedd Llewellyn and Yr Elen with wonderful views of Tryfan, The Glyders and Llyn Ogwen as you go. The walk starts from Llyn Ogwen where there is roadside parking. You then follow a track north along the River Lloer to Bryn Mawr and Cwm Loer where you pass around the pretty lake of Ffynnon Lloer. The route then involves a scramble to Pen Yr Ole Wen before continuing to the peaks of Carnedd Fach and Carnedd Dafydd. You continue to the 1,064 m (3,491 ft) summit of Carnedd Llewelyn, the second highest peak in Wales after Snowdon. Just to the east of the peak you will find the highest lake in Wales, Llyn Llyffant. From Carnedd Llewelyn you can continue a short distance north west to the 962 m (3,156 ft) peak of Yr Elen. It's a very challenging walk with some scrambling but you will be rewarded with spectacular views of Snowdonia, Bangor , Anglesey and the Irish Sea. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb Tryfan or enjoy an easier walk around Llyn Ogwen. Also in the range is Foel Fras near the coast at LLanfairfechan.",
