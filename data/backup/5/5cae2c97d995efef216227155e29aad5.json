  "description": "This super Cornish trail is suitable for both walkers and cyclists and takes you on a tour of the 480 hectare Goss Moor National Nature Reserve. The heathland includes waterways, marshes and still pools with the Screech Owl Sanctuary providing another highlight. The site is home to a number of rare species including silver-studded blue, marsh fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary and grizzled skipper butterflies. The circular route can be accessed easily from St Columb Road Rail Station near the village of Indian Queens on the eastern side of the moor.",

To the east you can explore Bodmin Moor and enjoy climbs to Helman Tor and Roche Rock. Just a few miles to the south you'll find the little village of Ladock and Ladock Woods. It's a serene place with pleasant woodland trails and some nice views of the Tresillian River in the village. Ladock also includes a 17th century pub which is worthy of some investigation. Just to the south there's the Tregargus Valley where you can enjoy woodland walks along the River Fal. There's also interesting industrial history with a series of old mine buildings and the old China Clay Works at Goonvean Quarry. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
