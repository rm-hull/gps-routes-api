In a conservation area and surrounded by a number of listed buildings. The pond was filled-in in 1955. The size and shape suggests that it was probably used for longbow practice at one time."

  "description": "These ancient woods near Huntingdon consist of 326 acres with lots of nice walking trails and interesting flora and fauna. Look out for 280 species of fern, conifer, flowering plant and trees. There are lots of pretty flowers in the spring and summer months such as bluebells, primrose and violets. It's great for wildlife too with several species of butterfly including Brown Argus, White Admiral and Purple Hairstreak. Also look out for Hazel Dormouse and Muntjac deer. To extend your walk you could visit the nearby Grafham Water. There's a great walking and cycling trail running around the lake with lots of water loving birdlife to look out for on the way. You can reach Brampton Wood and Grafham Water by cycling along National Cycle Route 12 which runs past the southern edge of the woods. This runs all the way to Huntingdon, passing Hinchingbrooke Country Park on the way. There is also a car park at the southern edge of the woods just off the Brampton Road.",
