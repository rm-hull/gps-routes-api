  "description": "A walk through the beautiful Dyfi Valley taking you from Aberdovey (Aberdyfi) on the coast to Llanuwchllyn before returning along the river to Borth. There is a long wooded section through Dyfi Forest and waterside sections along the river to enjoy. You'll also pass through the noteworthy town of Machynlleth as you skirt the edge of the Snowdonia National Park. Around here there's some nice riverside trails through the Lllyfnant Valley.",
