This walk uses the waymarked Nene Way to visit Irchester Country Park and the nature reserves at Rushden Lakes and Stanwick Lakes . You'll also visit the nearby towns of Irthlingborough and Higham Ferrers. The route starts just to the south of the town centre on the River Nene at Victoria Mills.

The popular park has peaceuful woodland paths, open meadows and also includes the interesting Irchester Narrow Gauge Railway Museum. There is also plenty of wildlife with Muntjac Deer, hedgehogs, stoats and squirrels. After leaving the park you head toward Irchester before returning to the river and following it east to Rushden Lakes. Here you'll pass through the Ditchford Lakes Nature Reserve and the Irthlingborough Lakes and Meadows Nature Reserve. It's a great area for wildlife spotting with Cetti's warblers, coots, oystercatchers and grey herons. The trail then visits the small market towns of Higham Ferrers and Irthlingborough. The walk can be extended by heading south to visit the Summer Leys Nature Reserve and the village of Great Doddington.",
