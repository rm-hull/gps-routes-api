  "description": "This 22 mile cycle or walk runs from Tavistock to the coast at Plymouth, along National Cycle Route 27. Much of the route is traffic free with visits to local parks and woods to enjoy on the way. The trail is named after the explorer Sir Francis Drake who was born in Tavistock and has a statue in Plymouth. The route also passes along  Drake's Leat a watercourse constructed in the late 16th century to tap the River Meavy which supplied Plymouth with its water. The route starts in Tavistock, next to the river Tavy. Near here you pick up a traffic free section running along a disused railway line. It will take you south west to Launceston New Road Bridge before heading south east towards the Tavistock Canal and Brook Mill on the river. You continue south to Rixhill before crossing the River Walkham on the Grenofen Bridge. You continue south through Sticklepath Wood and Harrowbear to Yelverton. Here you could stop off to the visit the beautiful Yelverton Garden House. The next stage takes you to Clearbrook where you pick up the Plym Valley Trail. This off road section follows the old Plym Valley railway from Clearbrook to the splendid Saltram Park. This section passes Bickleigh Vale and Great Shaugh Wood with views of the River Plym as you go. You'll also pass Cann Woods on your left as you make your way towards the coast. In Saltram park National Cycle Network Route 27 runs along a splendid traffic free trail through Saltram Wood and along the river. After passing the park you cross the river on Laira Bridge and head through Princes Rock and St Jude's before finishing near the harbour in Plymouth.",
