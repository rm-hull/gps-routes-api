  "description": "This circular walk visits Arnfield reservoir near Hadfield in the Peak District. You'll also venture into the surrounding hills and moorland where you can enjoy views of the Ogden Brook. You can start the walk from the parking area at the south eastern corner of the lake. From here you can pick up public footpaths heading along the eastern side of the water. At Arnfield Lane you can pick up the Pennine Bridleway and follow it north up to Arnfield Low Moor and Lees Hill. Here you could take a small detour to visit the Swineshaw Reservoirs which are just to the west of the hill. This walk follows the bridleway south to the Hollingworth Nature Reserve where there's a small lake, woodland trails through Swallow's Wood and lots of wildlife to look out for. The final section leads you east towards Tintwistle before returning to the reservoir.",
