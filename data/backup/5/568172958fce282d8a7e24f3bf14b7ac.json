According to local legend, there's a tale about a huntsman named Bowerman who lived on the moor around a millennium ago. While chasing a hare, he and his pack of dogs stumbled upon a group of witches by accident. In their pursuit, they overturned the witches' cauldron and disrupted their ceremony. Seeking retribution, the witches transformed one of their own into a hare, leading Bowerman and his dogs into a marsh. As a final act of punishment, the witch turned them all to stone - the dogs forming a jagged chain of rocks atop Hound Tor, while Bowerman himself became the rock formation known as Bowerman's Nose."

    "description": "This popular circular walk climbs to Bowerman's Nose in the Dartmoor National Park. The photogenic rock formation appears on many postcards and calendars of the area. It also sits in a lovely scenic location where you can enjoy some fine views over Dartmoor. You can start the walk from the village of Manaton where there is a public car park. From here you head south west to Hayne Down where there's a country trail taking you up to Bowerman's Nose. Along the way there are other great rock formations and some fabulous views back to the village and beyond. The route then descends back to Manaton along pleasant country lanes, crossing the Hayne Brook on the way. You can extend the walk by exploring the stunning Lustleigh Cleave and Becky Falls which lie just to the east.",
