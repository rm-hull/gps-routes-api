It's a picture postcard area with quaint stone cottages, nice pubs and lovely views of the river and the old Sheep Wash Bridge. This short walk takes you from Ashford in the Water to the nearby town of Bakewell. It's about a one mile walk, passing Ashford Lake and Lumford Mill with river views on the way. You can return the same way or get the bus back from Bakewell.",
