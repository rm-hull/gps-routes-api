Just to the north is the worthy village of Great Longstone. The historic village includes a 13th century church and a fine 17th century pub. Our circular walk from the village climbs to the splendid limestone ridge at Longstone Edge, just to the north of the settlement. Just to the south west you will find the village of Sheldon and the noteworthy Magpie Mine. Here you can explore a series of well preserved Lead Mines which date back to the 1600s. The historical site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and another of the local area highlights. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks and White Peak Walks pages."
