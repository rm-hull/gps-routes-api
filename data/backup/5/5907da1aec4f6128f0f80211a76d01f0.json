  "description": "This walk visits Foreland Point Lighthouse before exploring Countisbury Common on the Exmoor coast. It's an exhilirating walk with wonderful coastal scenery, pretty heather, woodland trails and challenging climbs. The walk starts from the Barna Barrow car park just off the A39 to the east of the village of Countisbury. You then head west to Butter Hill which stands at a height of 302 metres (990ft). The route then descends along the South West Coast Path and other public footpaths to Foreland Lighthouse at the most northerly point along the Devon and\u00a0Exmoor\u00a0coast. From here there are great views across the Bristol Channel to the Welsh coast. The route then heads east along the coast path towards Desolation Point, passing through Chubhill Wood on the way. The route then turns west, passing Kipscombe Hill and Countisbury Common before returning to the car park. To extend your walk you can head south and visit the lovely Watersmeet . Here you will find 2000 acres of river gorge and woodland with miles of walking trails to try. Just to the east you can explore the beautiful Doone Valley. Here you can try our lovely Lorna Doone Walk which visits some of the sites connected to Richard Dodderidge Blackmore's 1869 novel 'Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor'.",
