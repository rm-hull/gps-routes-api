In 1959 silica sand, which is used extensively in the glass-making industry and for making metal casting moulds, was discovered on this site and a quarry was dug here. This quarry was producing up to 500 tonnes per day until the pure silica ran out in 1972, and the site was abandoned leaving behind a massive hole that eventually filled with water and this lake was formed. The car park and visitor centre can be seen on the far side of the lake. Warning signs exist around the lake and a head-first diver was rendered tetraplegic and without any remedy in the law in the leading legal case of Tomlinson v Congleton Borough Council."
