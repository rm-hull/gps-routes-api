The walk makes use of the Three Castles Path and various woodland trails, taking you through Warren Heath, Hazeley Heath and Heath Warren Wood. You'll pass a number of pretty streams and tranquil ponds on the way. Look out for wildlife including deer and various woodland birds as you make your way along the paths. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Bracknell Forest or Wellington Country Park where you'll find miles of walking trails.",
