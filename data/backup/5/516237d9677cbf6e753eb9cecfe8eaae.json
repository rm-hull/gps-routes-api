The walk makes use of the Three Castles Path and various woodland trails, taking you through Warren Heath, Hazeley Heath and Heath Warren Wood. You'll pass a number of pretty streams and tranquil ponds on the way. Look out for wildlife including deer and various woodland birds as you make your way along the paths. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Bracknell Forest or Wellington Country Park where you'll find miles of walking trails.",

There are good facilities here with bike hire and coaching available from the Look Out Centre. Just over a mile to the north of the woods you can pick up the Blackwater Valley Footpath at the village of Swallowfield. The long distance trail runs along the River Blackwater to Aldershot, visiting Farnborough, Frimley Hatches Nature Reserve and Tri Lakes Country Park on the way. In nearby Hook there's some pleasant trails along the River Whitewater in the pretty Bassets Mead park on the eastern side of the town. The Three Castles Path passes through the forest. This historically themed long distance trail will take you from Windsor Castle to Winchester Castle, visiting the ruined Odiham Castle on the way."
