    "description": "This splendid cycling and walking trail follows a disused railway line through the Longdendale in the Peak District National Park . The path starts in Hadfield and runs alongside a series of beautiful reservoirs including Bottoms Reservoir , Torside Reservoir , Woodhead Reservoir and Rhodeswood Reservoir before finishing at Salter's Brook. It runs for just over 8 miles on a gradually ascending path which is ideal for both cyclists and walkers. There's also fine views of the lovely rolling hills and countryside for the duration of the route. It's easy to access with a train station and public car park right next to the start point at the western end in Hadfield. The route is part of National Cycle Route 62 which runs for 208 miles from the Lancashire coast at Fleetwood to Selby in North Yorkshire. You could extend your exercise by contuing along the signed route into the Peak District and beyond.",
