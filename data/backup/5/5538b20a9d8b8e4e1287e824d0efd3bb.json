This is just about the nearest publicly accessible viewpoint for this privately-owned castle. Richard Payne Knight inherited the estate in 1772 and he designed and built the castle, which was completed in 1778. The castle has a classical interior, but the exterior is all battlements and towers, reflecting Knight's passion for the Picturesque style. Of the 4,500-acre estate, the 900-acre area along the Teme Gorge (now a National Nature Reserve) was developed into a Picturesque landscape - wild and rugged and in deliberate contrast to the tame parkland being developed at the time by Capability Brown. Terraced gardens were later added by W A Nesfield in 1865. Since 1927, the castle has been the seat of the Clan Lennox."

  "description": "This circular walk visits the lovely Downton Gorge from the village of Downton on the Rock in Herefordshire. The scenic gorge is located on the River Teme, where it cuts through a limestone ridge near Leintwardine. It's also a designated nature reserve with photogenic rock formations and a number of rare trees and plants to see. The route starts from Downton on the Rock, about two miles south east of Leintwardine. From here you can follow country lanes east, passing the Grade I listed 18th century Downton Castle. The route then heads south and west to head through the woodland gorge, passing Castle Bridge and Hunstay Cottage. There's nice views of the river weir and pleasant wooded paths which eventually lead to Downton Bridge. Here you can cross the river and return to the village.",

There's wonderful views over the surrounding countryside from the fine viewpoint here. From the car park here there's also Bringewood to explore. Here you can access a number of decent red and black mountain bike trails which have been used for the National Championships. For more walking ideas in the area see the Herefordshire Walks page."
