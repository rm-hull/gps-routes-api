  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk along the beautiful Winscar Reservoir in the Peak District. The reservoir is ideal for a short, easy cycle or walk using the waterside tarmac path on the eastern side. The surrounding scenery of the Peak District makes a wonderful backdrop. You can start your outing from the car park on the eastern side of the water. There's another public parking area in Dunford Bridge just to the south if you'd prefer to start from there. Winscar Reservoir is located south of Holmfirth and west of Penistone. It's situated on the Trans Pennine Trail so there is scope for continuing your exercise along this trail. You could head east to the nearby Langsett Reservoir where you can enjoy more waterside walking and beautiful scenery. If you were to head south west along the trail it would take you to Woodhead Reservoir and Torside Reservoir .",

At the eastern end of Woodhead Reservoir there's a car park where you can start the Middle Black Clough Waterfall Walk. The area is a bit of a hidden gem with walks along the River Etherow to some beautiful waterfalls and wonderful rock formations. It's located just south of the popular Longdendale Trail and well worth a visit. For more walking ideas in the area see the Peak District Walks page."
