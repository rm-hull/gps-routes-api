The outlet of the reservoir then flows north into the lake in\u00a0Haberdashers' Aske's School\u00a0grounds known as Tykes Water Lake. It then proceeds north to make a confluence with a secondary stream, also called Tykes Water, near Kendal Hall Farm."

One of the highlights of the park is the Winnie the Pooh Nature Trail through 100 acre wood. The trail is great for children and includes \"Pooh Sticks\" at Pooh Bridge, Owl's house and Pooh's house.",
