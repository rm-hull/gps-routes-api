Tara runs along the bridge wall and jumps off the end. Tykes Water is a minor tributary of the River Colne in Hertfordshire in England. Its head waters are a network of drainage ditches west of the A41 near Bushey that feed into Aldenham reservoir. The outlet of the reservoir then flows north into the lake in Haberdashers' Aske's School grounds known as Tykes Water Lake. It then proceeds north to make a confluence with a secondary stream, also called Tykes Water, near Kendal Hall Farm."

  "description": "Enjoy 100 acres of woodland and parkland adjacent to a 60 acre lake at this splendid park near Elstree and Borehamwood. The park also has a rare breeds farm, pony rides and nature walks. The lakeside trail also makes for a lovely, peaceful cycle ride. One of the highlights of the park is the Winnie the Pooh Nature Trail through 100 acre wood. The trail is great for children and includes \"Pooh Sticks\" at Pooh Bridge, Owl's house and Pooh's house.",

      "content": "Just to the west of the park there's some trails alongside the adjacent Hilfield Park Reservoir next to the Elstree Aerodrome. The London Loop runs through the park providing an opportunity to extend your exercise. If you follow the trail east past Borehamwood and Elstree it will take you to the Scratchwood and Moat Mount Open Space. There's woodland trails, ponds and lots of wildlife to look out for here. At the park you can also pick up the lovely Dollis Valley Green Walk. This will take you along the pretty Dollis Brook with lots of wildlife to see along the way. Also nearby are the Harrow Viewpoint and Stanmore Common. Just to the north you can pick up the circular Radlett Walk and visit the affluent village. It will take you to the River Colne and Ver before a visit to Bricket Wood Common and the village of Aldenham. The self named village is worth a visit with a number of listed buildings and a 17th century pub. The Borehamwood Walk starts from the train station in the town. It visits the reservoir before heading to Stanmore Common, Bentley Priory Nature Reserve and Harrow Weald Common. It's a nice way of seeing some of the walking highlights of the area using public transport. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hertfordshire Walks page."
