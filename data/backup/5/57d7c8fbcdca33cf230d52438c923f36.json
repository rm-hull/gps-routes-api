  "description": "The River Dart Country Park is set in 90 acres, with lakes, parkland, woodland trails and a lovely waterside path along the River Dart. Other attractions in the park include the impressive Holne Park House with delightful grounds and the River Dart Adventures play area where children can clamber over space nets and swing through trees on jungle ropes! There is also an excellent cafe and restaurant for refreshments. See the link below for further information on the park and prices for entry. This free route takes you along the public footpath to the north of the park, starting at Holne Bridge. The park is located in the Dartmoor National Park, just north of Buckfastleigh and the adjacent Hembury Woods. Here you can enjoy some nice shady woodland trails and a climb to Hembury Castle Iron Age Hillfort. Just to the south is Buckfast Abbey where there's a series of well laid paths through the lovely gardens surrounding the abbey. The Dartmoor Way long distance trail also passes just to the west of the abbey. You can pick up the waymarked path in Buckfastleigh to explore the Dartmoor National Park. Following it west will take you to the pretty Venford Reservoir which has a nice trail around the water.",
