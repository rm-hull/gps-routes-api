    "description": "This waymarked circular trail explores the countryside and river paths to south of Bewdley. On the trail you'll visit the Blackstone Riverside Park and the Blackstone Rock, where a hermit once lived in the middle ages. You'll also pass the 19th century Ribbesford Hall and the Norman St Leonard's church on this historical trail. You can start the walk from the Gardner's Meadow car park just south of Bewdley. Alternatively there is more parking in the Blackstone Riverside Park on the trail. The trail runs for about 2 miles on fairly flat paths with a small climb on the way.",
