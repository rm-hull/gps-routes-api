  "description": "This small village is located on the south bank of the River Tyne to the west of Newcastle in Tyne and Wear. The village includes some nice riverside walks and easy footpaths around the Clara Vale Local Nature Reserve. The reserve includes ponds and streams created from the same spring that fed the old water mill. There's lots of wildlife and pretty wildflowers to see in the warmer months. This walk starts at the reserve car park and takes you through the site before heading up to the river. Here you can link up with the Keelmans Way , a shared walking and cycling trail that runs along the River Tyne from Wylam to the upper reaches of the Tyne and the Derwent Walk Country Park in Gateshead . The riverside path is a nice way to extend the walk. To continue your walking in the area head west to visit neighbouring Wylam and pick up the circular walk. This visits the historic Stephenson's Cottage , the village of Heddon on the Wall and the Hadrian's Wall Path National Trail."
