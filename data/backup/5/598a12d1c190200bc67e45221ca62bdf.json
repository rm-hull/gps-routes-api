  "description": "This historic Devon based town is situated on the edge of two Area's of Outstanding Natural Beauty - the East Devon AONB and the Blackdown Hills AONB. There's also some nice easy walks along the River Otter which flows through the town. The area has an interesting past being regarded as the antiques capital of the south west with a rich history in lace making and pottery. This walk from Honiton takes you to the nearby town of Ottery St Mary. It follows a section of the Exeter to Honiton Way, a waymarked trail running between the two settlements. On the way there are nice countryside trails and a waterside stretch along the River Otter to enjoy. The walk starts at the train station in Honiton which is run by South Western Railway. They operate hourly services between London Waterloo and Exeter St Davids. From here you follow roads south out of the town towards Coombehayes Farm. You continue west to Roundball Hill before coming to the village of Gittisham, along a series of country lanes. There's some nice thatched cottages in this little settlement. The trail then heads north west to Fenny Bridge where you cross the River Otter, just north of Alfington. It's a pretty spot with views towards the old mills at Feniton and the tranquil river surrounding by some attractive countryside. From Fenny Bridges you head south west toward Woodford Barton where you pick up riverside trails to take you along the Otter into Ottery St Mary.",
