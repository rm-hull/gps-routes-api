  "description": "The town of Aberdovey (Aberdyfi) is located in a lovely position on the west coast of Wales. There's lovely walks along the estuary of the River Dyfi and the coastal path. This walk follows a section of the Wales Coast Path from Aberdovey to the town of Tywyn , just to the north. The route runs along a flat, beach side path for about a distance of about 4 miles. On the way there's lovely beaches, sand dunes and fine views of the Snowdonia mountains in the background. In Tywyn you can also get a direct train back if you prefer not to walk. The Dyfi Estuary is also a nature reserve and a great place for wildlife watching. On the walk look out for osprey and otter in the summer months.",
