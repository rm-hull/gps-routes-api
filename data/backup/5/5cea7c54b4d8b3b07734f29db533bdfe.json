  "description": "The town of Aberdovey (Aberdyfi) is located in a lovely position on the west coast of Wales. There's lovely walks along the estuary of the River Dyfi and the coastal path. This walk follows a section of the Wales Coast Path from Aberdovey to the town of Tywyn, just to the north. The route runs along a flat, beach side path for about a distance of about 4 miles. On the way there's lovely beaches, sand dunes and fine views of the Snowdonia mountains in the background. In Tywyn you can also get a direct train back if you prefer not to walk. The Dyfi Estuary is also a nature reserve and a great place for wildlife watching. On the walk look out for osprey and otter in the summer months.",

The epic Dyfi Valley Way starts in the village. It heads to Llanuwchllyn before returning along the stunning river valley to Borth. On the opposite side of the estuary there's the Borth to Ynyslas Coastal Path which will take you along Borth Sands to visit Ynyslas and the Dyfi National Nature Reserve. There's some splendid high sand dunes to explore in the wildlife rich reserve."
