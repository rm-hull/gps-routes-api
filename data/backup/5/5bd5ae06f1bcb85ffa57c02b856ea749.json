  "description": "This circular railway walk from Bakewell uses part of the Monsal Trail to take you to the nearby Monsal Head . You'll then visit the neighbouring village of Ashford in the Water before returning to the town. The walk runs for just under 8 miles with some fine Peak District scenery to enjoy on the way. Start the walk on the eastern side of the river in Bakewell. Near here you can pick up the Monsal Trail and follow the old railway track north west to Monsal Head, passing Great Longstone on the way. Here you can visit the  Headstone Viaduct and the Monsal Head Hotel . This is a nice place for some refreshments at what is roughly the half way point on the walk. There's also fabulous views down to the Wye Valley and the lovely Monsal Dale from the elevated position of the Head. The route then heads south and then east along Pennyunk Lane to take you into Ashford in the Water. This delightful village is well worth exploring with quaint stone cottages, fine old pubs and great views of the river and the old Sheep Wash Bridge. From the village you head east along the River Wye to Bakewell, passing the Lumford Mill on the way.",
