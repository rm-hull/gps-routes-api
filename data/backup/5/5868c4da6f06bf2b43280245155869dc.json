The car park is divided into two sections. At the time this photograph was taken the more southerly section (behind the viewpoint) of the car park was closed off by a padlocked barrier. Off the left edge of the photograph a footpath leads through the trees joining Rowthorne Lane with the Rowthorne Trail."

    "description": "Enjoy a walk around this pleasant country park in Nether Langwith. There are two waymarked trails taking you to the park's viewpoint and the nature reserve. At the viewpoint there's a sculpture entitled 'Top of the World' which reflects the area's stone age past. There's far reaching views here across the countryside to Lincoln cathedral. The limestone paths are well surfaced and include a nice sculpture trail. It's great for flora and fauna with wildflower meadows attracting lots of butterflies in the summer months. Also look out for various dragonflies around the pretty ponds. Adjacent to Poulter Country Park is Scarcliffe Park where you will find a series of lovely woodland walking trails.",
