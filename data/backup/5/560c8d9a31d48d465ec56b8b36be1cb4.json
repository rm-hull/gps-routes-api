  "description": "This circular walk visits Skidby Windmill near Beverley, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The Grade II listed mill dates back to 1821 and is a popular local attraction. Inside there's an interesting museum where you can learn all about the history of the area. You can start the walk at the good sized mill car park just to the south east of Skidby village centre. After exploring the mill you can then follow footpaths west to Gallows Hill and Eppleworth Hill. Head north from here and you can pick up a section of the Beverley Twenty and follow it east through the village centre where you will pass the 18th century St Michael's Church. The route then turns south to follow a road back to the mill car park.",
