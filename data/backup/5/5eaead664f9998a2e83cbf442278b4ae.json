    "description": "The Cotswolds town of Nailsworth has some lovely walking trails to try on three large areas of common land located to the north of the town. There's also the National Trust's Woodchester Park and Thames and Severn Canal running through the area. This walk from the town centre takes you up onto Minchinhampton Common before picking up the Cotswold Canals Walk and following it into Stroud. You can reach the common by heading north from the town centre. There's miles of footpaths here with great views over the Cotswolds from the elevated common. You can follow the paths towards the Thames and Severn Canal and then pick up the towpath. Heading south will take you toward the impressive Brimscombe Mill but this route heads north to take you into Stroud. Rodborough Common is just north of Minchinhampton Common and a great place to extend your walk. The common is also a nature reserve with a wide variety of flora and fauna. Woodchester Park is also located very close to the town. You can extend your walking here on trails taking you through a tranquil wooded valley to five pretty lakes. Near here you can pick up the Cotswold Way long distance trail and follow it through Selsley Common . The Stroud Valleys Trail starts in Nailsworth too. The shared cycling and walking trail will take you to Stonehouse along a dismantled railway line.",
