  "description": "This fine circular walk explores the village of Parkgate on the River Dee estuary. It's a splendid place for a stroll with great views across the marshes and a wide variety of birdlife to look out for. This includes huge numbers of wildfowl and waders. Keep your eyes peeled for grey herons, egrets, peregrine falcon, merlin, hen harrier and short eared owl. The route heads along the Parkgate Parade and then follows a section of the Wirral Way cycling and walking trail. It's a flat, easy walk with great views of the village parade on the coastal section and lots of wild flowers and butterflies along the disused railway line. To extend your walk you can head north along the Wirral Way to Wirral Country Park for more great views across the estuary.",
