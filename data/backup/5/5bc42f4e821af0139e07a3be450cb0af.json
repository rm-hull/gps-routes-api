  "description": "Enjoy miles of woodland walking and cycling trails in this beautiful area of mixed woodland near Truro. This circular route starts at the car park at the western end of the forest and takes you around the area on good paths. Features in the forest include an Iron Age hill fort, lots of pretty bluebells in spring and the River Allen which runs past the western end of the forest. The woods are made up of beeches, larches and eucalyptus.  It's a great for wildlife too with roe deer, otters and badgers to look out for. The woods are are very popular with mountain bikers with numerous off road trails to try. Just a few miles to the north east you'll find the little village of Ladock and Ladock Woods. It's a serene place with more woodland paths and some nice views of the Tresillian River in the village. Ladock also includes a 17th century pub which is worthy of some investigation.",
