  "description": "This beautiful loch near Dunkeld is also a wildlife reserve, run by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. The loch is a popular bird watching site with the nesting ospreys the main draw. There's also red squirrels, beavers, woodpeckers and deer to look out for in this lovely area. You can start the walk from the car park and visitor centre at the western end of the loch. Then pick up the trails to the woodland, bird hides and lochside. There's also a country lane/footpath running along the southern side of the loch which you can follow towards the Loch of Butterstone to the east. To continue your lochside walking in the area you could head and east and visit Loch Clunie. The epic Cateran Trail can also be picked up in nearby Blairgowie.",
