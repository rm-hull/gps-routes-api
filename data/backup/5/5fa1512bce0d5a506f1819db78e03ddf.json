  "description": "This Cheshire based town is famous for its train station which is one of the largest stations in the North West and a major interchange station on the West Coast Main Line. For walkers there's a pleasant town park and to the west the Shropshire Union Canal towpath. This short circular walk in the town visits the picturesque Tipkinder Park and Queen's Park. In the park there's some nice surfaced footpaths taking you around the landscaped gardens and the pretty lake where you can feed the ducks and swans. It's a fine place for a peaceful stroll in the town centre.",
