The National Trust owned park covers thousands of acres with miles of great cycling and walking trails surrounding the 18th century mansion. On the northern end of the estate you will find the Ellerhayes Bridge and the River Culm Walk. There's another small car park here next to the photogenic 15th century bridge. You can park here and enjoy a stroll along the River Culm with more lovely views to enjoy. The historic village of Broadclyst and the peaceful woodland trails around Ashclyst Forest can also be found in this area."
