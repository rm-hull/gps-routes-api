  "description": "This pretty village is located in West Wiltshire near Bradford-on-Avon and Bath. It's an interesting and historic place with a Grade I listed Manor House, a church dating back to the 12th century and a fine local pub dating to the 17th century. For walkers there's some lovely open countryside with views of the surrounding countryside of the River Avon valley and the Cotswolds. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring village of South Wraxall and Lower Wraxall. You can start from the historic Monkton Farleigh Manor House which dates to the 1700s and includes the ruins of a 12th century priory. From here you can enjoy a walk down the Grand Avenue where there are fine views across the estate grounds. This will takes you east towards Wraxall where there is another old manor house and a disused chapel. Here you can also pick up a section of the Macmillan Way and follow it south between South Wraxall and Lower Wraxall. The route then follows a country lane north west to return to Monkton Farleigh.",
