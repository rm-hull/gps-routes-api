This 16th-century structure was originally built by the Turnbull family, known for their Border reiver activities. The tower underwent a significant restoration in 2013, transforming it from a state of disrepair."

  "description": "This walk climbs to a wonderfully positioned peel tower in Roxburghshire, in the Scottish Borders. From the 16th century tower there are some splendid views over Teviotdale and beyond. You can start your walk from the car park to the east of the hill. Then follow the steep track up to Minto Crags and the tower. From the parking spot it\u2019s roughly a 30 - 40 minute walk to the top where you can take in the far reaching views of the surrounding countryside and hills. To continue your walking in the area head east to Harestanes where you can climb to the Waterloo Monument on Peniel Heugh hill and enjoy some fine views of the area. The Georgian Monteviot House and Jedburgh Abbey are also located in this area.",

      "content": "As of 2022, interior access to the castle is restricted, a departure from previous years when visitors could obtain a key by leaving a small deposit. This unique system not only allowed exploration of the castle's interior, including all four floorless storeys and the 56-foot height connected by a spiral staircase to the parapet walk, but also contributed to restoration funds. Despite this change, the castle's location still promises visitors breathtaking views across Teviotdale, northward to the Eildon Hills, and southeast towards the English border, making it a worthwhile destination."
