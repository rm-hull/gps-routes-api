  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Irton Pike in the western area of the Lake District. The fell is one of the lesser known so a nice peaceful and fairly easy climb to try. There's a car parking area just to the south of the fell where you can start your walk. Then follow the trails north east up to the 751 feet (229 m) high summit of the fell. From here there are great views to Wast Water to the north east and of the surrounding lakeland fells. The route then descends through woodland to Mecklin Park before following an alternative path back towards the car park. The fell can also be climbed from the nearby villages of Eskdale Green and Santon Bridge. You could extend the walk by heading south into Irton Park. Here you can enjoy more woodland trails, views of the Stony Beck and a visit to Parkgate Tarn. For a longer circular walk starting from the car park at Porterthwaite at the south eastern end of Miterdale Forest. There's views of the River Mite on this alternative route with more details in the video below.",
