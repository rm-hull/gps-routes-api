  "description": "This delightful nature reserve near Easington has nice footpaths to follow. The paths will take you through attractive woodland and along the pretty Hawthorn Burn. The reserve is located just to the south of Seaham. You could follow the Durham Coastal Footpath to reach the site. Alternatively there is a car park just to the north of the reserve. From here you can pick up the footpaths east through the reserve to the coast. You'll pass the railway viaduct before coming to Hawthorn Hive, with cliffs and rocky shore. Look out for a variety of flora and fauna including snowdrops, wild garlic and bluebells in the spring. Notable wildlife includes jay, treecreeper, great spotted woodpecker and roe deer. If you would like to extend your walk you could follow the coast path south and visit the lovely Castle Eden Dene. Here you will find miles of woodland trails, pretty streams, rushing waterfalls and an abundance of wildlife in this splendid nature reserve in Peterlee.",
