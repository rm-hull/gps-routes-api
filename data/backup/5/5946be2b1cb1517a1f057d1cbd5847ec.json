    "description": "This circular walk from Kettlewell takes you to the neighbouring villages of Starbotton and Arncliffe. There's lovely views of the surrounding Wharfedale and Littondale countryside as you make your way through the area. The walk starts in the village and heads west to pick up the Dales Way . Follow the waymarked trail north along the River Wharfe and it will take you to Starbotton. This pretty village is nicely located on the river and has a number of attractive old dwellings. After exploring the village you head south west, crossing the river to pass Wibbertons Fields. You continue south west across Old Cote Moor to come to Arncliffe in the Littondale valley. The village may look familiar as it was the original setting of the soap Emmerdale Farm. It's an attractive place with a village green, stone built cottages and striking farmlands. There's also nice views where the Cowside beck runs into River Skirfare. The route then leaves Arncliffe and heads east to cross the River Skirfare before passing the Middlesmoor Pasture and returning to Kettlewell.",
