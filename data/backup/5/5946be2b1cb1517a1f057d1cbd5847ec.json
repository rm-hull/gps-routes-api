  "description": "This circular walk from Kettlewell takes you to the neighbouring villages of Starbotton and Arncliffe. There's lovely views of the surrounding Wharfedale and Littondale countryside as you make your way through the area. The walk starts in the village and heads west to pick up the Dales Way. Follow the waymarked trail north along the River Wharfe and it will take you to Starbotton. This pretty village is nicely located on the river and has a number of attractive old dwellings. After exploring the village you head south west, crossing the river to pass Wibbertons Fields. You continue south west across Old Cote Moor to come to Arncliffe in the Littondale valley. The village may look familiar as it was the original setting of the soap Emmerdale Farm. It's an attractive place with a village green, stone built cottages and striking farmlands. There's also nice views where the Cowside beck runs into River Skirfare. The route then leaves Arncliffe and heads east to cross the River Skirfare before passing the Middlesmoor Pasture and returning to Kettlewell.",

      "content": "For a more challenging hike from the village try the Circular Walk around Kettlewell. This climbs to Great Whernside where there are excellent views over the area. Just to the north west of Arncliffe you can pick up the Littondale Walk. This starts from the nearby village of Litton and explores the northern end of the dale with more riverside trails and excellent views. You could also head to the popular town of Grassington on the Grassington to Kettlewell Walk. Here you can pick up the Grassington Circular Walk. Just to the west of Grassington you'll also find the worthy village of Threshfield. The pretty settlement includes an historic 16th century inn and the nearby Threshfield Quarry. The quarry is an unusual and atmospheric place for a walk with its limestone rocky cliffs and distinctive turquoise lakes. Head north and you could enjoy a couple of walks from the village of Buckden. The climb to Buckden Pike is one of the highlights of the area. The circular Upper Wharfedale Walk also exposes you to some splendid limestone scenery and local wildlife. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nidderdale Walks page."
