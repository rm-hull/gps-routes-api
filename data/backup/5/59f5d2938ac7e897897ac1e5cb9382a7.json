  "description": "This walk follows the Chesterfield Canal through Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and Derbyshire from Chesterfield to West Stockwith. You will pass 36 locks and 11 bridges as you walk along one of England's most beautiful waterways. The walk passes Stavely, Retford and Worksop while there is also a pleasant section around the lovely Rother Valley Country Park at Killamarsh. Here you will find 5 lakes and a nature reserve which boasts the recording of over 260 different varieties of birds over the past two decades. Just south of Rother Valley Country Park you will pass the splendid Renishaw Hall at Eckington's. Here you will find a large country house surrounded by beautiful gardens, parkland, woodland and lakes. Around Retford the splendid Idle Valley Nature Reserve is well worth a small detour. The huge site has miles of walking trails with several lakes and hundreds of species of wetland bird to look out for.",
