  "description": "Follow in the footsteps of seventh century pilgrims on this interesting walk or cycle through Tyne and Wear. The trail links the twin Anglo-Saxon monastery of St Peter's in Wearmouth and St Paul\u2019s in Jarrow. The route passes through the beautiful landscape of the Great North Forest which includes twelve miles of rolling hills and meandering streams. Trail highlights includes a waterside stretch along the River Don and the final coastal stretch along Whitburn Sands and through to the finish point near Sunderland Harbour. You'll also pass the Cleadon Hills Nature Reserve where there's a photogenic old mill and some wonderful views over the area. There is also the Bede's Cycleway which follows a very similar route to the walk - please click here for more information.",
