  "description": "This village is located in East Riding of Yorkshire, near the larger settlements of Hornsea and Beverley . It's a nice place for a walk with some pleasant country trails, an ancient medieval\u00a0church and a notable 16th century pub for refreshments after your walk. This walk from the village takes you west to visit the lovely Tophill Low Nature Reserve. The reserve is one of the area's walking highlights with waterside walks along the River Hull and two picturesque reservoirs. The site is also great for wildlife with a large variety of water loving birds frequenting the lakes. You can reach the reserve by picking up bride tracks heading west through Westfield. Then follow country lanes to Hempholme Haverham before turning south west to link up with the River Hull.",
