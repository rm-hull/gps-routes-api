  "description": "This easy walk takes you along the River Severn from Stourport to Bewdley. It's about a 4 mile walk along a fairly flat section of the Severn Way long distance footpath. Start the walk on Stourport Bridge and follow the Severn Way north west, passing the pretty riverside meadows and Areley Hall on the opposite side of the river. Areley Hall mainly dates from the late 16th century, though extensive alterations were carried out in the 1820s and 1870s. It is Grade II listed and largely timber-framed with some brick additions. You continue to Blackstone and then past the Bewdley-by-pass before crossing the river at Bewdley Bridge. The three-span masonry arch bridge over was designed by civil engineer Thomas Telford and dates from the 18th century. This route finishes in Bewdley but you could extend the walk by continuing south along the opposite side of the river to the Blackstone Riverside Park and Ribbesford Woods where there's some nice woodland trails. In the town you could also visit The Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Gardens which are located between the Bewdley Museum and the River Severn. The Bewdley museum, housed in the Guildhall explores the history of the town and has displays on local crafts such as coopering, basket making, agriculture, charcoal burning and tanning. See the Wyre Forest page for more walking and cycling ideas in the area.",
