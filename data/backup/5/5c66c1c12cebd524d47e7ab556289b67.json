  "description": "Enjoy a short, waterside walk around Ashworth Moor Reservoir from Owd Betts pub in Rochdale. The walk starts from the Owd Betts car park on the Edenfield Road, just to the north west of Rochdale. The 18th century pub has an interesting history and is a great place for refreshments after your walk. From the car park you can pick up an easy footpath leading around the water for just over a mile. After you finish your exercise you can enjoy a lovely pub lunch at Owd Betts where there's outdoor seating with wonderful views over the surrounding hills of the South Pennines. The Rochdale Way long distance trail runs past the eastern end of the reservoir. You could pick up the waymarked path and head east to climb Knowl Hill and visit Greenbooth Reservoir and Naden Reservoir. It's a lovely, peaceful area with nice views towards Manchester and the nearby Scout Moor Wind Farm. Heading south east along the path will take you into the pretty Ashworth Valley where there's nice trails along the Naden Brook and the Cheeseden Brook.",
