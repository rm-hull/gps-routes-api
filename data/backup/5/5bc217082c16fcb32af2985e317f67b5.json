  "description": "This short walk explores the Wyboston Lakes Nature Reserve near St Neots. The walk starts from the Hotel complex next to the reserve. It's located just to the south of St Neots and includes a golf centre and spa. You could also reach the site on foot from the town by following the Ouse Valley Way if you prefer. Just to the south of the hotel you'll find the pretty nature reserve where there are some nice footpaths taking you along the lakes. It's a pretty spot with a variety of flora including Willow trees, common fleabane and marsh woundwort. Wildlife to see includes foxes, dragonflies, damselflies and warblers. To continue your walking in the area you could try our St Neots Walk and visit the delightful Riverside Park and the nearby Paxton Pits Nature Reserve",
