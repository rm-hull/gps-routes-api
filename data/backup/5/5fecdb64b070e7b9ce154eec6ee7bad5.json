  "description": "This pretty Cornish village includes a picturesque harbour and some fine walks into the surrounding Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This circular walk from the village visits Nare Head, Carne Beach and the neighbouring village of Veryan. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow the waymarked trail south west to Jacka Point, The Straythe, Blouth Point and Nare Head. From here you turn north west to visit Carne Beach and Pendower Beach. The route then turns north east to follow pleasant country lanes past Gwendra to Veryan. More country lanes then take you east past Sunny Corner to return to Portloe.",
