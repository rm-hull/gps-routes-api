  "description": "This super waterside walk follows the River Usk, the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and the Brecon and Newport Canal from Caerleon to Brecon. The walk passes through Abergavenny and Usk and is enclosed by beautiful hills for the whole of its length. There are also splendid views of the Brecon Beacon mountains, particularly towards the end of the walk. The route is relativley flat as much of it takes place alongside the river or the canals, so there are only a few notable climbs. The walk is waymarked using a white symbol of an otter's head, an animal you may well see on the river.",
