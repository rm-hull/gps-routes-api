The two sister villages are located on the Manhood Peninsula in the Chichester district of West Sussex, a few miles south of Chichester. You can start the walk from the beachside public car park at East Wittering. Then head north west along the lovely wide beach with fine views over Bracklesham Bay . At the western end of the route you can head north along Berrybarn Lane to visit West Wittering. To extend the walk you could continue around to East Head on the West Wittering and East Head Walk . The National Trust owned area is a great place to look out for a wide variety of coastal birds.",
