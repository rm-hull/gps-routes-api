The oversailing timber framed frontage was added after a fire in the C16, whilst the original ground floor is of stone. An important Grade I Listed building. The inn was later used as the headquarters of Monmouth's army, during the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, after his retreat from Bath. In the aftermath of the failed rebellion Judge Jeffreys used the George Inn as a courtroom and conducted 12 executions on the village common, as part of the Bloody Assizes. The building has been used as a setting for films such as The Remains of the Day, Tom Jones, and The Canterbury Tales, as well as in the television adaptations of Persuasion by Jane Austen and Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe."
