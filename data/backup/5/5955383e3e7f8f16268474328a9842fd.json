  "description": "This pretty Hampshire based village is home to a lovely National trust property, a 13th century church, prettty thatched cottages and some fine country views. Cheriton has pleasant walks along the River Itchen and two significant waymarked walking trails running through the area. There's also some interesting history with the site of the Battle of Cheriton in 1644. The battle was part of the English Civil War that took place about one mile to the east of the village in the 17th century. Cheriton is located just to the south of the town of New Alresford. This circular walk explores the surrounding countryside visiting Hinton Ampner and the Source of the River Itchen on the way. Part of the route uses sections of the Wayfarer's Walk and the Itchen Way which starts just to the south of the settlement.",

They serve fine food and have a lovely large garden area to relax in. You can find them at Brandy Mount, SO24 0QQ."

      "content": "To the east of the settlement there's some nice peaceful woodland trails around Cheriton Wood. Head south from the village to neighbouring West Meon and you could explore the lovely Meon Valley on the Meon Valley Trail. The shared cycling and walking trail also links up with The South Downs Way National Trail which can be used to climb to the viewpoint on Beacon Hill."
