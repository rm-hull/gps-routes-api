      "caption": "Baylham Lock, River Gipping. The river Gipping flows from north of Stowmarket to Ipswich, where it turns into the Orwell. It was navigable by invading Danes in 860AD, and for deliveries of stone to Bury St. Edmunds abbey in the eleventh century. In 1793 it needed major works to create the Ipswich and Stowmarket Navigation, with a series of locks. This one ensured the water mill had a head of water. The system fell into disuse after the railway was built in 1846. It is currently being refurbished. Judging by the curve the boats used must have been quite short."

  "description": "Follow the River Gipping from Stowmarket to Ipswich on this pleasant riverside walk. The path passes Needham Market, Claydon and Sproughton before finishing in Ipswich. There is a variety of water loving wildlife to look out for on this walk as well as interesting old water mills and locks. Also on the path are Needham Lake and Suffolk Water Park near Claydon. The latter is a particularly nice place to stop for refreshments or to try your hand at fishing. The route links with the Mid Suffolk Footpath which takes you on a tour of the local villages and countryside.",
