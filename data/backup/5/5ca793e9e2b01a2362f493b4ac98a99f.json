  "description": "This easy, circular walk explores the area around Rochford in Essex. The path starts and finishes in Rochford, passing Hockley, Canewden and Paglesham Churchend. There are lovely riverside sections, one along the River Crouch where there are views of Bridgemarsh Island and Burnham on Crouch. At the eastern end you'll also come close to Wallasea Island where there is a RSPB nature reserve. The second section runs along the River Roach estuary, taking you back into Rochford. As such there is a variety of water based wildlife to enjoy with a Nature Reserve on the River Crouch a further highlight. At Hockley you'll pass through the extensive Hockley Woods where you'll find carpets of bluebells, Oak and sweet chestnut trees, streams and wildflowers. Just after the route passes through the pretty Cherry Orchard Jubilee Country Park with its lake, bluebell woods and riverside paths.",
