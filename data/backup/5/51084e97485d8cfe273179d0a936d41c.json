  "description": "This Welsh Language Heritage Centre is located near the village of Llithfaen on the wonderful Llyn Peninsula. It's a fine place to start a walk with car parking and a lovely cafe for refreshments afterwards. You can enjoy a stroll around the pleasant grounds and then walk down to the beach. It's a remote place so an ideal place for a peaceful walk in a lovely surroundings. On the way there are historic signs of the old quarrying village of Porth y Nant, which was abandoned midway through World War II after the cessation of quarrying.
