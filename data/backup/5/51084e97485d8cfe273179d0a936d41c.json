    "description": "This Welsh Language Heritage Centre is located near the village of Llithfaen on the wonderful Llyn Peninsula . It's a fine place to start a walk with car parking and a lovely cafe for refreshments afterwards. You can enjoy a stroll around the pleasant grounds and then walk down to the beach. It's a remote place so an ideal place for a peaceful walk in a lovely surroundings. On the way there are historic signs of the old quarrying village of Porth y Nant, which was abandoned midway through World War II after the cessation of quarrying. This circular walk uses part of the Wales Coast path and other footpaths to explore the area around the centre. Local highlights include the climb to the wonderful viewpoint at Yr Eifl , the ancient hillfort at Trer Ceiri and the epic Llyn Coastal Path . Scroll down for a list of walks near the centre.",
