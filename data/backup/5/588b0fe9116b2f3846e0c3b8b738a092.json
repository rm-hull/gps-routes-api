  "description": "This lovely circular walk takes you along the coast from the little village of Aberffraw on Anglesey. The route runs for just over 7 miles with a couple of small climbs. There's fine sea views, a riverside trail and lots of attractive countryside paths to enjoy on the way. You'll also visit the sand dunes of Tywyn Aberffraw which lies just to the east of the village. The walk starts in the village and follows the River Ffraw south to the coast at Aberffraw Bay. It's a lovely spot where the river meets the sea at Traeth Mawr. There's yellow gorse, a pretty beach and views towards the mountains of Snowdonia in the background. The route then follows the coast path west along the bay to Porth Cwyfan. Here you leave the coast, heading north past The Anglesey Circuit. This motor racing circuit is located in Ty Croes and plays host to a variety of motorsport events. From here you follow the footpath east to take you back to the village. The route then heads east of the village to visit Tywyn Aberffraw. This area of common land is one of the finest dune systems in the country. You can follow public footpaths around the peaceful dunes before returning to Aberffraw. The Anglesey Coast Path runs through the area so you can continue your walking on this waymarked path. If you follow it north it will take you to Rhosneigr and the pretty Llyn Maelog. See the Rhosneigr and Llyn Maelog Walk for more details. Head east and it will take you to Malltraeth and the expansive Newborough Forest where you can pick up Lon Las Cefni. This shared cycling and walking trail runs from the forest to Cefni Reservoir along mainly traffic free paths.",

Also of note is the nearby island of Cribinau with the 7th century church of Saint Cwyfan perched on top. The church still holds services in the summer and is sometimes used for weddings, with access by boat. Llyn Coron is located just over a mile north east of the village. There are some nice footpaths to follow around the pretty lake."
