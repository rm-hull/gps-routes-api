  "description": "This large area of coniferous woodland on the western edge of the North York Moors is very popular with mountain bikers and walkers. You can start off at the Sneck Yake car park a couple of miles east of Boltby village. There's miles of tracks, bridleways and footpaths to try with fantastic views over the moors from the forest's elevated position. See the video below for an example of the jumps and bumps you will find on the downhill track in the woods. The Cleveland Way national trail skirts the eastern edge of the forest so you could pick this up to further explore the Hambleton Hills area of the moors. Heading north will take you to the 1,308 feet (400 m) high Black Hambleton and then on to Silton Forest where there are more off roading oppportunites.",
