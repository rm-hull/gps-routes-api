  "description": "This large area of woodland near Marlborough has miles of hard surfaced cycling and walking trails to try. It's nice for an easy family cycle and there are more challenging tracks for mountain bikers. Walkers can also enjoy various waymarked trails and an easy access route. The woods consist of a beautiful plantation of beech trees with carpets of bluebells in the spring. The Wansdyke Path runs through the woods so you could pick this up to continue your exercise. You could also reach the woods from Marlborough by following the Wansdyke Path south west from the town centre for about 2 miles. If you head east from the woods you can visit the expansive Savernake Forest where there's thousands of acres of woodland to explore.",

      "content": "Just to the north west of the forest you can visit the largest stone circle in Europe at the historic Avebury Stones. It's one of the highlights of the area and designated as a World Heritage Site. A few miles to the north there's Fyfield Down National Nature Reserve and the Grey Wethers. These ancient stones are considered the best assemblage of sarsen stones in England."
