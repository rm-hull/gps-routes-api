  "description": "This country house near Sheffield is surrounded by attractive parkland and gardens. The main feature is the lovely Renishaw lake which has nice footpaths along the water and through the surrounding woodland. It's a lovely place for a stroll with wide grassy paths, shady woods and the River Rother running past the lake. Next to the hall there is a splendid 19th century Italianate garden with statues, beautiful flower arrangements and a fountain. At the time of writing the gardens are open Wednesday to Sunday and on Bank Holiday Mondays, 10.30am to 4.30pm during the season. Please check the link below for more details though. The Trans Pennine Trail and the Cuckoo Way both run right past the park so you could pick up one of these trails to extend your walk. If you were to head north you would come to the lovely Rother Valley Country Park where there are more walking trails around the large lakes.",
