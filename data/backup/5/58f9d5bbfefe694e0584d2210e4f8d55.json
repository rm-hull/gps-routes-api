  "description": "This waymarked heritage walk takes explores the area around Lower Machen, near Newport. There's some nice woodland trails and riverside paths to enjoy along the Rhymney River. Start the walk from the Hollybush Inn in the village of Draethan. From here you can pick up the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk to take you south into Coed Craig Ruperra. The route then climbs along woodland trail to the viewpoint at Ruperra Summerhouse. Here you'll find the ruins of an old Motte Castle and fine views over the Rhymney Valley. The route then descends towards the Grade II listed Ruperra Castle, built in 1626. The castle has an interesting history which includes a visit from King Charles I, in 1645, after the battle of Naseby. From the castle you head east through the forest to the river at Tre'sguthan. Here you will pass the Iron Bridge which spans 16 metres and was constructed in 1829. The bridge was part of Lord Tredegar's estate, who commissioned its construction to provide access for horse drawn vehicles and pedestrians from Ruperra Castle to and from the church at Lower Machen and the Lower Machen area. The route then follows some nice riverside paths to take you to the Draethen Bridge where you cross the water and return to the village. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the Hollybush Inn. You can extend the walk by continuing along the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk to visit Mynydd Machen and the delightful Parc Cwm Darran where you can enjoy peaceful woodland trails, lakeside paths and sunny wildflower meadows.",
