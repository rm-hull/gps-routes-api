  "description": "This easy cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line between Ladybower Dam down and Bamford station. It runs for just under 2 miles along a flat path with views of the River Derwent and a woodland section near the reservoir. It's a good one for families or anyone looking for an easy cycle or walk. The route runs along a section of the Derwent Valley Heritage Way so there is scope for extending your walk along this long distance path. Heading south east will take you along the river to Hathersage. There's also a good cycling trail around the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower Reservoirs. If you're on foot try the Ladybower Reservoir Walk or the climb to Win Hill. You can take a short detour from the path at Parkin Clough to climb the hill where you will enjoy fabulous views over the reservoir. The summit is only about a quarter of a mile west from the path and a great option if you are on foot.",
