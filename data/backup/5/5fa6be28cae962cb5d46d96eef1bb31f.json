The waterway, constructed in the late 18th century, is entirely straight and at a single level, making it separate from the wider UK canal network. Its purpose was to facilitate maritime trade through the town's port.\nUlverston Canal played a significant role in the industrial development of Ulverston, with wharves constructed in the town to handle cargo from seagoing vessels. Despite losing economic significance with the establishment of the Furness Railway in the mid-19th century, the canal remained operational for commercial use until the 1940s when it was eventually abandoned. Today, a property management company oversees its preservation, supported by funding from GlaxoSmithKline, which operates a nearby plant."

Stretching between its former sea entrance, Canal Foot at Hammerside Point on Morecambe Bay, and its basin and wharves in Ulverston, the canal features a 112-foot-long (34 m) sea lock, the only lock on its route. However, the lock has been sealed with a concrete dam and footbridge. Alongside the canal, there's a sheep and cattle auction, and some waterside buildings have undergone renovation. At the mouth of the canal stands the Bay Horse Hotel, once an 18th-century coaching inn; the Cumbria Coastal Way intersects the canal at this location."

Access to the area was primarily through the hazardous sands of Morecambe Bay. In 1835, a passenger ferry service from Ulverston Canal to Liverpool began, later complemented by a service from Barrow-in-Furness to Fleetwood. The canal also connected with the Lancaster Canal, facilitating the transport of coal, culm, and cinders without incurring sea duty. Goods were transported as far as Glasgow and Cardiff using the canal.\nThe increased use of the canal led to the development of various industries in the area. Timber-related activities such as charcoal burning and hoop-making thrived, alongside shipbuilding, gas and chemical works, rail engineering, and paper manufacturing. Ulverston boasted a significant shipbuilding industry in the 1800s, constructing robust wooden sailing ships tailored for transporting local ore rock cargoes. One notable example is the barquentine Gaerwen, a 249-ton vessel built in 1878, which later operated out of Salcombe."

The establishment of the Furness Railway in 1846 significantly impacted the profitability of the canal, prompting its eventual purchase by the railway company. Additionally, the development of Barrow-in-Furness as a deep-water port further contributed to a decline in trade. Shipbuilding in Ulverston ceased after 1878, and commercial use of the canal continued until the First World War, officially ceasing at the end of the Second World War.\nUlverston Town Council has since taken responsibility for maintaining the canal, overseeing a walkway on its eastern side. The western side remains industrialised, hosting a large GlaxoSmithKline factory built on the former ironworks and paper mills site. Glaxo purchased the canal from the town council in 1974, using it as an emergency water reserve. In 2009, GlaxoSmithKline reevaluated its operations in Ulverston and subsequently sold the canal to Ulverston Canal Company, a subsidiary of NPL Estates Ltd, which specialises in land management. A Trust, established by GlaxoSmithKline, ensures funds are available for the canal's ongoing management, maintenance, and preservation."

    "description": "This short canal runs from the centre of the Cumbrian town of Ulverston to the coast at Morcambe Bay. At just over a mile long it makes for a nice easy stroll with lovely coastal views to enjoy at the end. There's also nice views of the Lake District fells and water loving wildlife to look out for on the water. The canal links with the Cumbria Coastal Way where you can extend your walk. Heading south will take you to Bardsea with nice views over Cartmel Sands and Ulverston Sands. Heading north takes you to Greenodd with views over the River Leven. At the town end of the canal you can pick up the Cumbria Way and head deeper into the Lake District. Also near Ulverston is the fascinating Birkrigg Common . You can follow the Cistercian Way to Urswick Tarn and then explore the network of paths on the elevated common. Here you will find Carboniferous limestone, an ancient stone circle and wonderful views over the Furness Peninsuala.",
