  "description": "This little village has some nice trails to try through the Frome Valley and up into the Cotswold Hills. This walk takes you along the river and the Thames and Severn Canal to the nearby village of Sapperton. It's about a 2 mile walk along a nice flat waterside path. Surrounding the canal are various woods including Sapperton Wood and Frampton Wood. There are miles of public footpaths here which you could take a detour to explore. You can extend your walking around the village by trying the longer Sapperton Circular Walk. This runs close to the Source of the Thames near Kemble. Part of this route also uses the Cotswold Canals long distance footpath. You could continue west along the waterside trail to Chalford and the Toadsmoor Valley .",
