  "description": "This walk explores the historic Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. The ancient castle dates back to the 13th century and is Grade 1 listed. There's some nice walking paths to follow around the castle's extensive grounds. Here you can explore the beautiful formal gardens which date to 1828 and include a famous herbaceous border thought to be the longest in Northern England. There's also lakes, peaceful woodland trails and some fine views of the countryside and the Cheviot hills. On the walk look out for wildlife including various woodland birds, Deer, red squirrels, rabbits and badgers. There's a couple of good options for extending your walk if you have time. Just to the south there's Hepburn Woods where there's more pleasant woodland trails and a fine viewpoint at Hepburn Crags. On the eastern side of the castle grounds there's also the Iron Age Hillfort at Ros Castle .",
