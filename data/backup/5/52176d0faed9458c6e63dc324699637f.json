  "description": "Follow the Ceredigion Coast Path from New Quay To Cwmtydu on this lovely coastal walk along Cardigan Bay. The route runs for a distance of just over 3 miles, following the waymarked footpath along a splendid cliff top path. Along the way there's glorious views to the coast and countryside with a number of secluded coves and some splendid rock formations. At the end of the walk you'll come to the delightful hidden gem of Cwmtydu with its attractive little beach and wooded valley. At the western end you can extend your outing by picking up the Llangrannog to Cwmtydu Walk to visit nearby Llangrannog. Heading east will take you along the popular New Quay to Aberaeron Coastal Path .",
