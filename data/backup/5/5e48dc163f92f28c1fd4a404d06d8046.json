    "description": "Hunstanton has some beautiful coastal walking to enjoy with the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path National Trail passing through the town. The seaside town faces west across The Wash, making it one of the few places on the east coast where the sun can be seen setting over the sea. This walk takes you along the waymarked trail to the nearby village of Thornham . It's about a 6 mile walk on flat trails with lovely beaches, sand dunes and nature reserves to enjoy. The walk starts in the lovely cliff top gardens in Hunstanton where there's a very pretty Sensory Garden. The route heads north along the cliffs to St Edmund Point where you will find the remains of St Edmund's Chapel and Old Hunstanton Lighthouse. The present lighthouse was built in 1840 although there has been a Lighthouse on the site since 1665. The trail continues towards the village of Holme-next-the-Sea. The position of the village on the North Sea coast makes it a prime site for migratory birds in autumn. There are two nature reserves on this section including the Holme Dunes National Nature Reserve. The reserve's sand dunes, salt marsh, pasture and pools are important for breeding birds like pied avocet, and wintering ducks, geese and waders. There are a range of coastal habitats including, freshwater pools, grazing marsh and saltmarsh. After passing through the lovely coastal reserve the route turns inland to take you to Thornham. You can extend your excercise on our Thornham Walk which will take you to the nearby village of Brancaster and the Titchwell Nature Reserve. Continuing east will take you to the Holkham National Nature Reserve which is a major highlight of the Norfolk Coast.",
