  "description": "This peaceful walk visits North Cliffe Woods in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The small woods are located just west of the hamlet of North Cliffe near South Newbald and Market Weighton. The woods are also a nature reserve with lots of flora and fauna to see. Look out for pretty bluebells in the spring, attractive birch woodland and wildlife including deer, blackcap, chiffchaff and warbler. You can park on a grass verge near the site and then follow about 2 miles of circular footpath. Good footwear is advised in the winter months when the paths can be quite muddy. There's another fine local nature reserve to visit in the shape of the North Cave Wetlands. These lie just to the south and include a pleasant circular footpath with waterside paths along a pretty lake.",
