  "description": "This circular walk from Oxted explores the countryside and woodlands to the east of the Surrey town. You'll visit Limpsfield Common, Crockhamhill Common and the 17th century Squerryes Court. The route runs for about 10 miles and follows a mixture of waymarked trails and public footpaths with some moderate hill climbs on the way. From the high points there are splendid views of the surrounding countryside of the High Weald and the North Downs. The walk starts from Oxted train station which is about 20 miles (32.69 km) from London Bridge. There are regular trains from the capital to the commuter town, taking about half an hour. From the station you head south through the town to meet up with the Greensand Way. Follow the waymarked trail east and it will take you through Limpsfield Common, Tenchleys Park, Limpsfield Chart and Crockhamhill Common. Limpsfield Common is owned by the National Trust and includes hundreds of attractive beech trees and carpets of bluebells in the spring. At the eastern end of the common you will find a lovely community orchard which is a haven for wildlife and wildflowers. At Crockhamhill Common you turn north toward Westerham where the route visits Squerryes Court. This fine 17th century manor house is surrounded by extensive gardens which are well worth exploring. After exploring the gardens you head south west to Limpsfield Chart before turning north west past the golf course. The final section heads west through Oxted to return to the train station.",
