  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the central part of this fine city before heading along the River Witham. On the way you'll visit the historic cathedral and the lovely Lincoln Aroboretum. The walk starts at Lincoln Cathedral where you can pick up the Viking Way . The structure is one of the most impressive cathedrals in the country daing back to 1072 when construction commenced. It was built in the Early Gothic style and for hundreds of years held one of the four remaining copies of the original Magna Carta, now securely displayed in Lincoln Castle. From the cathedral you head south east along the waymarked trail to the Arboretum which was created in 1870. The Grade II listed park has a series of surfaced footpaths taking you to beautiful gardens, lakes and fountains. It's a splendid place for a stroll in the centre of the city. The route then heads east through the city to Greetwell Hall where you turn south to meet with the River Witham. You can then follow a footpath west along the river where there are nice views back to the city. On the southern side of the water there's also the option of following the Water Rail Way . This shared cycling and walking route runs along the route of the former Lincoln to Boston Railway Line. The paths will take you west back into the city centre where you can turn north to return to the cathedral. You'll also pass Lincoln Castle on the walk. The Norman castle  was constructed during the late 11th century by William the Conqueror on the site of a pre-existing Roman fortress. You can tour the interesting castle and see one of the four surviving originals of the Magna Carta, sealed by King John after his meeting with the Barons at Runnymede in 1215.",
