In the background, water partially filling the bay, half way through the ebb tide. Further back you can see the area leading to Ross links between Budle and Holy Island (Lindisfarne)."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Bamburgh Castle to the lovely Budle Bay, part of the Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve. It's a lovely stretch of coast with fine views across to the Farne Islands and lots of interesting birdlife to look out for on the way. The walk starts from the car park of the Grade I listed Bamburgh Castle. The castle is open to the public and well worth a visit if you have time. There's fine state rooms, an art gallery, a stable block and a 12th century keep which is the oldest surviving part of the castle. From here you can follow the coastal road north west to Bamburgh Moor and Budle Point. It's a stunning area with interesting rock formations, sand dunes, a beautiful beach and fine views over to the nearby Lindisfarne Castle and Holy Island. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for including grey seals, Pinkfooted and greylag geese, wigeons, grey plovers and bar-tailed godwits. After passing the Heather Cottages the route reaches Kiln Point where you turn south towards Budle. Footpaths across farmland then reach the B1342 road which you can follow back to the castle. The St Oswald's Way long distance footpath runs along this section of coast so you could extend your walk by continuing along the trail. Our Alnwick to Bamburgh Walk links the two historic castles using a section of the path.",
