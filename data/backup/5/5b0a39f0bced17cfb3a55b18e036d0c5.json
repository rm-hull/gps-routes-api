  "description": "Explore these ancient woods near Bexleyheath on this easy walk on the border of London and Kent. The area is historically and archeologically significant with remains found from Roman times. This is represented with a series of impressive wooden sculptures. Look out for the Saxon Warrior and Roman Soldier pieces in particular. There's lots of wildlife to see also. Look out for bats, woodpecker, owl and dormouse all of which are represented by a sculpture. The wood has lots of good waymarked footpaths and nice wide bridleways for cyclists to follow. It's a peaceful place for walkers to visit on the outskirts of the city. With over 136 hectares (325 acres) to explore on miles of paths there's plenty to keep walkers and mountain bikers busy. You can start your walk from Bexley train station just to the north of the woods. Then follows paths south to the site. As well as the extensive woodland there's an area of open heathland with ponds and picnic tables. Look out for pretty plants and flowers including bluebells, lily-of-the-valley, honeysuckle and wood sage. The London Loop passes close to the woods so it's to extend your walking in the area. You can follow it to a number of parks and nature reserves close to the wood. At Foots Cray Meadows nature reserve you can enjoy a waterside walk along the River Cray while at Scadbury Park you can explore the ruins of Scadbury Manor. The popular trails at Petts Wood Circular and Jubilee Country Park are also close by.",
