A seemingly natural outcrop, the extensive scree of debris and remains of benching with produced limestone boulders indicate that this too is extensively quarried. The local Carboniferous Limestone has always been a valuable asset, both for building stone and agricultural lime. The narrow gap of the Dulas valley as it cuts through the coastal hills is a natural point at which to exploit these mineral riches."

  "description": "This town in North Wales has some nice walks along the coast and local woodland to try. This circular walk takes you along the coast to Llanddulas before returning through the countryside and woodland to the south of the town. The walk starts on the seafront in the town next to the train station. From here you can pick up the North Wales Path and follow it west along the coast to Llanddulas. Along the way there are fine views over the Abergele Roads to Rhyl with the Clwydian Hills making a splendid backdrop. In Llanddulas the route turns south along the River Dulas before following country lanes to Rhyd-y-Foel. Another country lane takes you east back into Abergele. This section passes Gwrych Castle, a striking Grade I listed 19th-century country house. You can visit the castle which is now open daily for visitors to explore and enjoy the 250 acres of historic gardens and parkland. The castle became famous in 2020 when it was used as the setting for the 20th series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! After passing below the castle the route skirts the edge of Gopa Wood before returning to the town. To extend your walking in the area you could continue west along the coast path to Colwyn Bay. Heading east will take you to Rhyl where you could try our Rhuddlan To Rhyl Walk which takes along the River Clwyd.",

It's a lovely building with a fine walled garden to sit out and relax in during the summer months. It is located on Mill street at postcode LL228ES. After your walk head to the George & Dragon on Market Street in Abergele. Here you can enjoy a nice meal in the outdoor seating area. You can find it at postcode LL22 7AF for your sat navs."

The historic Bodelwyddan Castle is also near here and well worth a visit. On the western side of Gwrych Castle there's the small village of Rhyd y Foel where you can enjoy a climb to the Pen y Corddyn Mawr hill fort. There's photogenic limestone scenery and more fine views over the River Dulas valley from this interesting ancient site."
