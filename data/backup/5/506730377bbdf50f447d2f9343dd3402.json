      "content": "The Air Balloon is located on the route close to Crickley Hill near Gloucester. It is housed in an attractive Cotswold stone building, dating from the 18th century. Outside there's a nice beer garden to relax in on warmer days. There's a good menu and a decent selection of ales too. You can find it at postcode GL4 8JY right next to the park. There's usually quite a few walkers in there who have just climbed the adjacent hill so it's a nice place to stop at on the walk. In the village of Broadway you could stop off for a bite to eat at The Broadway Hotel. The hotel is in a lovely spot on the quaint village green, alongside beautiful boutiques and honey-coloured cottages. It includes a brasserie and a racing themed bar, inspired by the nearby Cheltenham Racecourse and its famous Gold Cup. The Broadway dates all the way back to 1575 and also has a fine garden area to relax in on warmer days. It also provides good quality accommodation and can be easily found on the High Street in the village at a postcode of WR12 7AA. In Dursley head to the noteworthy Old Spot Inn. The inn dates back to 1776 and includes a charming interior with low ceilings and comfortable connecting bar-rooms which are adorned with interesting \"breweriana\" from times gone by. The inn is also a CAMRA National Pub of the Year with a fine range of ales to choose from. Outside there's a lovely garden area where you can relax on warmer days. You can find the pub at 2 Hill Road with a postcode of GL11 4JQ. The Old Crown in the pretty village of Kelston is well worth consideration.

Sometime later it became a \"cobbler shop\", a tea room and then an off-licence.  You can find the inn on the High Street at postcode WR12 7NE for your sat navs. The pub is dog friendly. Stanton is also well worth exploring with a number of ancient houses built from the honey coloured limestone quarried from the nearby Shenberrow Hill.
