The park is great for wildlife with great-spotted woodpeckers, owls, foxes and squirrels to look out for. The main highlights in the park are Crime Lake and the Hollinwood Branch Canal which was opened in the 1920s. There's also good facilities with a nice cafe and car park The park is very popular during the summer, with up to 30,000 visitors a month visiting the park, which stretches 18 miles from Bishops Park in Oldham to Paradise Wharf in Manchester. The Medlock Valley Way long distance path runs through the park so it's easy to extend your outing. If you head west along the path you will soon come to Clayton Vale.
