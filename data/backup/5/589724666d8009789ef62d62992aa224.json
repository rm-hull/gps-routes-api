    "description": "This delightful country park in Halifax is the perfect place for a peaceful afternoon stroll. The park includes a Wilderness Garden, cascades and pools, woodland and a fruit garden with a collection of heritage fruit trees. The centrepiece of the park is the Mere, where you can hire a rowing boat or just stroll along the shore. You can also visit Shibden Hall -  a Grade II listed timber framed hall with a history dating back back to 1420.  Park facilities include a popular cafe and visitor centre. The circular Shibden Valley Walk also starts from the car park. The trail explores the lovely countryside and hills of Shibden Dale, to the north of the park. It's a good way of further stretching your legs if you have time.",
