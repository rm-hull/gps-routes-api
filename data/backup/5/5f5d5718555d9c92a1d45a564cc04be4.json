Despite its popularity, the railway line faced financial difficulties in the mid-20th century, and it was eventually closed in 1966 as part of the Beeching cuts, which saw many of the UK's railway lines closed in an effort to reduce costs. The line was subsequently dismantled and much of the track was removed, although some sections of the line, such as the tunnel at Ventnor, remain intact."

    "description": "This walk follows the old railway line from Shanklin To Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. The railway line closed in the 1960s but you can now walk or cycle along a section of the old track from Shanklin to Wroxall. The route provides a fascinating glimpse into the island's industrial and transportation history. Start the walk from Shanklin Railway Station and head south west past Upper and Lower Hyde to the village of Wroxall. This opening section is known as the Sunshine Trail and is also suitable for cyclists. The tree lined path passes a series of the old railway bridges and also provides some fine countryside views on the more open sections. The route then heads south to St Boniface Downs on the Ventnor Downs . Here you can enjoy some fantastic views over the area before descending into Ventnor. For an alternative walk between the two settlements please see the Shanklin to Ventnor Coastal Walk page.",
