  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk to the lovely Bowcombe Creek from the popular market town of Kingsbridge in the South Devon AONB. There's much to enjoy in the area with lovely views of the boats in the estuary and nice green lanes with lots of wildflowers and butterflies to look out for. The route starts in the town centre and passes through the town before heading east through the countryside to the Bowcombe Creek. The creek is a great place for bird watching with herons, egrets, redshank and shelduck to look out for. Buzzards and Peregrine Falcon are often seen overhead. After exploring the creek the route then follows other footpaths back through the countryside to the town. You can extend your walking in the area by heading south and enjoying a circular walk along the Salcombe and Kingsbridge Estuary. Here you will find reed beds, mudflats and eelgrass beds supporting an abundance of wildlife on the estuary. Dolphins, seals and basking sharks can all be seen from the paths.",
