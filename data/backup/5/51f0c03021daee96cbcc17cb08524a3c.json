Note: there is no white spot on your screen. It is a hang-glider."

  "description": "These pretty reservoirs are located near the Staffordshire village of Gailey in the Penkridge area of the county. It's a nice place for a stroll with views across the water to the surrounding countryside. You can follow footpaths along the Lower and Upper Reservoir before linking up with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal for some more waterside walking. The towpath will lead west to Gailey village where you'll find a pretty loch and weir. The reservoir is also the home of South Staffordshire Sailing Club so you will probably see some sailboats on the water on a fine day.",
