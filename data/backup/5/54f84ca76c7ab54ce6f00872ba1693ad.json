  "description": "This popular circular walk in the Cairngorms takes you around the beautiful Loch an Eilein and the smaller Loch Gamhna. It's a beautiful and tranquil location with the still waters surrounded by stunning hills and mountains. The undulating footpaths around the lochs are generally very good and not challenging. There are sections near to the water and several delightful woodland trails through the surrounding Rothiemurchus Forest. Also of interest is the unusual ruined island castle and the visitor centre. Parking is available at the northern end of the loch or you can catch the train to Aviemore which is a few miles north of the loch. If you're on a bike you can cycle from Aviemore train station along National Cycle Route 7 and a country lane near the Loch An Eilein Pottery to reach the loch. The walk to Loch Einich starts from the visitor centre and car park here. It will take you south through beautiful Glen Einich to the tranquil loch.",
