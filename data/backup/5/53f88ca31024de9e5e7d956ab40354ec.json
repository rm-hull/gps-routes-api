  "description": "Explore the gardens and wider estate surrounding this 700 year old house in Dartmoor near Plymouth. There are a number of way-marked walking trails taking you through meadows, orchards and woodlands where you can enjoy far-reaching views of the Tavy Valley. This circular route starts at the abbey and takes you past the lovely gardens into Great North Wood and on to the River Tavy where you can follow the riverside path through more woodland. There's plenty of wildlife - look out for Badgers, bats, eels,\u00a0hobbies, barn owls and deer\u00a0as you make your way through the woods. The gardens include an Elizabethan Garden, Herb Garden, Cider House Garden and Kitchen Garden. They include hydrangeas, camellias, eucryphias, azaleas, rhododendrons and magnolia trees. In the spring months you can also see carpets of bluebells in the woods.",
