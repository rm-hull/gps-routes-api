  "description": "Follow the River Dane through Derbyshire and Cheshire on this fabulous walk from Buxton to Middlewich. Highlights on the route include the wonderful Three Shires Head where the counties of Cheshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire meet. Here you will find pretty waterfalls, pools and an old packhorse bridge. Near here you will pass the fascinating deep mossy chasm of Lud's Church. The route also passes through the attractive town of Buxton and the delightful Buxton Country Park. Here you can enjoy a climb to the Victorian folly of Solomon's Temple and enjoy some wonderful views over the valley. Just west of Buxton there's Axe Edge Moor where you will find the source of the river at the foot of Cheeks Hill. Near Congleton there's also the lovely Brereton Heath Local Nature Reserve. There's a pretty lake and an abundance of wildlife to see here.",
