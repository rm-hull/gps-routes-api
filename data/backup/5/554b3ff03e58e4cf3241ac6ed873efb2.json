    "description": "This circular walk takes you from Ockley Station to Leith Hill , one of the major walking highlights of the South Downs. It's a great way to explore the area if you are coming by public transport. The walk starts from Ockley Train station which is only about 29 miles (47.1 km) from London Waterloo station. From the station you can pick up public footpaths heading west to Ockley village and Forest Green. Here you turn north before passing through Leith Hill Wood where you pick up the Greensand Way and follow it east up to the hill summit. The hill is the highest point on the Greensand Ridge, reaching a height of 294 metres (965 ft) above sea level. On the summit there is an 18th century Gothic tower, with panoramic views northwards to London and south to the English Channel. After taking in the views the route heads south through Leith Hill Place Wood and Jayes Park to Ockley. You then follow the same paths east to return to the train station where the route finishes. To extend the walk you could head west from the hill to the nearby village of Holmbury St Mary and climb Holmbury Hill for great views over the Weald of Sussex. The expansive Winterfold Forest can also be found in this area.",
