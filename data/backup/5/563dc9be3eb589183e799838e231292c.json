  "description": "This walk visits the historic Witchampton Mill before exploring the countryside surrounding the village of Witchampton near Wimborne in Dorset. On the way you'll enjoy views of the River Allen and skirt the edge of Crichel Park which lies just to the east of the settlement. The walk uses a mixture of public footpaths, bridleways and country lanes with a woodland section near the lake. There's also a section along the Hardy Way long distance footpath. It's a very picturesque area with lots of quaint thatched cottages in Witchampton and the neighbouring settlement of New Town. There's also a 15th century church to see near the start of the walk. To extend the walk head south to visit King Down, Badbury Rings, Kingston Lacy and Pamphill .",
