  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Garsdale in the Yorkshire Dales. The picturesque vale is a lovely place for a walk with becks, waterfalls and wonderful countryside views. The walk starts from Garsdale railway station on the Settle and Carlisle Line, which runs between Carlisle and Leeds via Settle. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north west to Clough Force Waterfall. The route continues north to Blake Mire before picking up paths along the pretty Grisedale Beck to Galey Hill and the Round Ing Gill. You then head south east across Grisedale Common to South Lunds before turning south west to return to Garsdale Head and the train station.",
