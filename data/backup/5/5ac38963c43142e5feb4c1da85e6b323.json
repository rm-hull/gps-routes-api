  "description": "This walk uses a section of the Sefton Coastal Footpath to explore the coast around Crosby in Merseyside. It's an interesting area with the famous 'Another Place' sculptures by Antony Gormley a notable highlight. This route runs for just under 5 miles from Waterloo to Hightown, using flat paths. The walk starts and finishes at railway stations so you can catch the train back at the end of your exercise if you like. The route starts from Waterloo Station, on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. From here it is a short walk to the Marine Lake and the coastal path. You then head north to Hightown, passing Blundellsands, the West Lancashire Golf Club and the sculptures. The piece was created in 1997 and consists of 100 cast iron figures facing towards the sea. The figures are modelled on the artist's own naked body which has caused some controversy. As the tides ebb and flow, the figures are revealed and submerged by the sea. The route finishes at Hightown where there's nice views of the River Alt and a train station where you can return to Waterloo.",
