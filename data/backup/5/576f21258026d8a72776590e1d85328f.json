In March the churchyard is very photogenic, often being covered in wild daffodils."

    "description": "Explore the pretty countryside, orchards and woodland surrounding the village of Dymock on this circular walk in the Forest of Dean. The trail runs for about 9 miles through Dymock Woods and Kempley Green with lots of wild Daffodils to see in early spring. Also look out for bluebells and butterflies in the section through Dymock Woods. Features on the walk include the 12th century church at Kempley which is well worthy of some investigation. To extend the walk you could further explore the woods which include Hay Wood and Queen's Wood. The Poet's Path also runs past Dymock. You could pick this up and enjoy a walk along the river Leadon to Ketford.",
