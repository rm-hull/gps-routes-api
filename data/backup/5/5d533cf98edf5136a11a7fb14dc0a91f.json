  "description": "This Dorset village is located just south of Wimborne near the River Stour. This circular walk from the village takes you along the river to visit the historic Wimborne Minster. There's some pleasant riverside paths on both sides of the Stour so you can turn it into a circular walk. You can start off in the village and then head north to cross the river on the Canford Suspension Bridge. Then follow the footpaths west towards Wimborne where you can explore the photogenic ancient minster and its Norman and Gothic architecture. To continue your walking around Canford Magna head east along the river to visit the pretty Longham Lakes. The beautiful grounds at the National Trust's Kingston Lacy are also not far away.",
