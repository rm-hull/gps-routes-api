  "description": "This pretty village is a great base for exploring some of the highlights of the popular Dove Dale area of the Peak District. The village includes attractive houses and a pretty green and duck pond. There's also an interesting history with the\n13th century\u00a0parish church\u00a0of\u00a0Saint Giles and the 17th century\u00a0Hartington Hall. Hartington is popular with tourists so there are good facilities with a car park, pubs, a youth hostel and a visitor centre at\u00a0Hartington signal box, on the site of the former\u00a0Hartington railway station. From the village you can directly explore the lovely Beresford Dale and Wolfscote Dale Nature Reserves, just to the south of the centre. This then leads you into Dovedale which is one of the highlights of the Peak District. Just to the east of the village you can pick up the Tissington Trail . This cycling and walking trail follows a disused railway line through some stunning scenery. Right next to that is the High Peak Trail which also follows an old railway line from Cromford to Dowlow. These two rail trails are a great way to explore the Peak District on foot or by bike. The fascinating Neolithic henge monument of Arbor Low is also within easy reach of the village. The limestone circle sits in an elevated position\u00a0with super views over the White Peak area of the Peak District. The Midshires Way and Pennine Bridleway long distance trails can also be picked up just to the east of the village. The circular walk below takes you from the village through Wolfscore Dale before returning through the adjacent Biggin Dale . The walk gives great views of the River Dove and includes some nice woodland sections and lots of interesting flora and fauna. The walk is reasonably flat with some more challenging climbs towards the end of the route in Biggin Dale.",
