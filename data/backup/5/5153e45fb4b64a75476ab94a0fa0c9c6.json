  "description": "This beautiful bay is located just to the north of Newquay on the Cornish coast. There's a wonderful 2 mile long sandy beach which is very popular with surfers and holiday makers. This walk from the bay takes you south to Porth Island and Trevelgue Head. The walk starts from the Watergate Bay car park where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow the trail south along the beach. After about 1.5 miles you will come to Porth where you can cross a footbridge to visit the Trevelgue Headland. From here there's lovely views down to Porth Beach and along to Newquay to the west. To continue your walking in the area you could head south on the Newquay to Perranporth Walk or north to visit the glorious Trevose Head .",
