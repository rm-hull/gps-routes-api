  "description": "This historic village is located just south of Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd. The village is surrounded by the wonderful scenery of the Snowdonia National Park, with mountains, waterfalls and lakes to explore. This walk from the village visits the nearby Rhaeadr Cynfal waterfalls. The falls are located just south of the settlement in the Afon Cynfal gorge. You can follow footpaths to the falls and then enjoy a riverside walk east to Bont Newydd, passing the railway viaduct over Ceunant Cynfal on the way. To continue your waterside walking in the area head a few miles north west to the Llyn Stwlan Dam and the Tanygrisiau Reservoir .",
