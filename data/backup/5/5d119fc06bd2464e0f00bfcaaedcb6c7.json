  "description": "This popular climb to Conic Hill gives wonderful views over Loch Lomond. The hill is situated above Balmaha and can be reached by following a good, stepped path along the West Highland Way to the summit. The walk starts from the Balmaha car park/visitor centre and heads through the woodland of the Balmaha plantation before climbing the wooden steps and following grassy paths to Conic Hill. The views back over Loch Lomond towards the Arrochar Alps and Ben Lomond are stunning. You can descend the same way or extend your walk by continuing along the West Highland Way to the Burn of Marr and Milton of Buchanan. This would turn the route into a longer circular walk.",

      "content": "One nice idea is to catch the ferry to the picturesque Inchcailloch Island where you can enjoy nature trails and a little beach. You could also explore miles of woodland trails around Balmaha Forest. The epic West Highland Way also runs through Balmaha. You could pick up the long distance trail and follow it north along the loch to Rowardennan on the Balmaha to Milarrochy Bay and Rowardennan Walk. It's a popular section of the waymarked trail with a visit to the beautiful Milarrochy Bay a real highlight. For more walking ideas in the area see the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs Walks page."
