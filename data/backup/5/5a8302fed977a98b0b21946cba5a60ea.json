  "description": "A challenging circular walk visiting Little Hangman and Great Hangman Hills near Combe Martin in Devon. The walk starts in Combe Martin and heads east to Little Hangman Hill via Lester Point. You continue by climbing the 1044 feet (318 metres) high Great Hangman Hill. It is England's highest sea cliff and the highest point on the South West Coast Path. At the summit you wil find a cairn and can enjoy fabulous views over the surrounding coast and countryside. The route then descends through the countryside to Knap Down, before returning to Combe Martin. Here you can wander through the pretty village, admire the beautiful Combe Martin Bay and reward yourself with refreshments at one of the excellent pubs. There's also fine views over Holdstone Down and towards Lundy Island. In the summer months look out for pretty flowers such as primroses and violets and wildlife including warblers and various coastal birds. If you would like to extend your walking in the area then you could head east along the coast to the lovely Heddon Valley. Here you will find riverside walking trails and the imposing cliffs of Heddon's Mouth.",
