  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Ardsley Reservoir in East Ardsley, near Tingley in Leeds. It's a nice easy stroll with the path running for just over a mile on a nice flat footpath. There's good views of Emley Moor and Haigh Moor in what is a very peaceful and picturesque spot. You can start the walk from the small car park, located on the eastern side of the water. Postcode for your sat navs is WF3 1EE. The Leeds Country Way passes just to the west of the reservoir. This waymarked long distance path is a great way of exploring the surrounding area on foot. You can pick it up in West Ardsley near the Hey Beck. It will take you towards Batley in one direction or Wakefield in the other.",
