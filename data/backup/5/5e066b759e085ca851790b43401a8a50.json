  "description": "This short circular walk visits the impressive Pensford Viaduct from the Somerset village of the same name. The route runs for just over a mile, passing the structure with views of the River Chew to enjoy on the way. The walk starts in the pretty little village of Pensford where you can pick up the Two Rivers Way long distance footpath. Follow the trail west and  it will take you along the river to the viaduct. The now disused viaduct was built in 1874 to carry the Bristol and North Somerset Railway over the valley of the River Chew. The Grade II listed building is 995 feet (303 m) long, reaches a maximum height of 95 feet (29 m) to rail level and consists of sixteen arches. The route continues west to Byemills Farm where you can cross the river. Here you can pick up the Three Peaks Walk and follow it east back into the village. To extend your walking in the area you can follow the Three Peaks Walk about a mile to the east to visit Lord's Wood where you'll find some nice woodland trails. Just beyond the woods you'll find Hunstrete House with grounds including Hunstrete Lake, a walled garden and an icehouse which is also a listed building. If you head west from the village along the Two Rivers Way you can visit Chew Magna and the lovely Chew Valley Lake where there is a delightful nature trail to try. Near here there's also the delightful Litton Reservoir to visit. The Community Forest Path passes through the area and will take you on a tour of the countryside, villages and historic estates around Bristol.",
