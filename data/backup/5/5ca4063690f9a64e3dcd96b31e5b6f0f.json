    "description": "This is a lovely waterside walk visiting Oulton Broad, the River Waveney and the pretty Carlton Marshes Nature Reserve near Lowestoft . The walk uses part of the long distance Angles Way and a series of other footpaths to explore the area. As well as the lovely Suffolk Broads scenery there's a huge variety of interesting wildlife. Look out for birds of prey including marsh harrier, barn owl and hobby. There's also lots of interesting plants including marsh orchid, marsh marigold and ragged-robin. You can start your walk from the Oulton Broad car park or from Oulton Broad South railway station. From here you can pick up the Angles Way footpath which will take you into the reserve. Trails then take you along the waterways including various dykes and the River Waveney. There's also nice views across the large expanse of water and marsh that is Oulton Broad. Look out for a variety of watersports taking place on the water. The broad is a popular tourist spot with lots of restaurants, cafes, pubs, bars and shops. You can extend your walking in the area by following the Angles Way along the northern side of the broad. The path then continues to Flixton Wood and Flixton Lake before coming to the delightul model village of Somerleyton . Continuing west along the Angles Way will take you along the River Waveney into Beccles .",
