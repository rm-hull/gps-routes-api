    "description": "This walk visits Lough Nahanagan, Camaderry Mountain and Turlough Reservoir before climbing to Turlough Hill for wonderful views over the Wicklow Mountains. The walk starts from the Wicklow Gap car park just to the north of Lough Nahanagan. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south to the Lough before climbing to the 698 m (2,290 ft) summit of Camaderry. The route then bends round through Sevenchurches to the Turlough Hill Reservoir. Here you will find a hydroelectric Power Station which can generate up to 292 megawatts (392,000 hp) of electricity at times of peak demand. It is Ireland's only pumped-storage hydroelectricity plant. From here you climb to the west to reach the 681 metres (2,234 ft) summit of Turlough Hill. The granite mountain is covered with blanket bog, a habitat for heather, purple moor grass, Sphagnum moss and a number of Alpine plants. There's also great views over the surrounding lakes and mountains of Wicklow. To continue your walking in the area head a short distance to the south to visit the lovely Glendalough Lakes . Here you will find waymarked trails, taking you around both lakes with riverside sections, woodland and a waterfall to enjoy as well. Just to the south west of the hill you can pick up trails to take you up to Lugnaquilla , the highest mountain in Ireland.",
