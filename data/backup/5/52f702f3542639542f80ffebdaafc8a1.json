  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this reservoir in South Yorkshire's Ewden Valley near Stocksbridge. There's a nice footpath running around the perimeter of the water for just over 2 miles. You can enjoy excellent views across the water to the Peak District countryside and woodland. Start the walk from the small parking area on the southern side of the water. It's located just off New Road near Fox Hill Wood. From here you can pick up the signed footpath to take you around the lake. The reservoir is located a short walk from More Hall Reservoir so you can easily extend your walk here. Also nearby is Wharncliffe Woods and Grenoside Woods where you can pick up the long distance Trans Pennine Trail .",
