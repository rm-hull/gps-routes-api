  "description": "Cross from England into Wales on this walk across the Severn Bridge. The route runs for just under 5 miles from Aust to Chepstow, using fairly flat footpaths, with a moderate climb towards the end. The walk starts from the village of Aust on the eastern side of the river in South Gloucestershire, England. Head west out of the village and you can pick up a section of the Severn Way to take you to the bridge. The iconic suspension bridge was opened on 8 September 1966, by Queen Elizabeth II, replacing the Aust Ferry which had previously transported cars across the river. A shared cycling and walking trail now runs across the bridge, passing Aust Cliff and Aust Rock before coming to Beachley. There's spendid views over the river and surrounding countryside to enjoy on the crossing. At Beachley the final section of the bridge passes over the River Wye, taking you into Chepstow in Wales. The route then picks up a section of the Wales Coast Path to take you along the Wye into Chepstow where the route finishes. To extend the walk you could continue through the Wye Valley and visit the splendid Tintern Abbey on our Wye Valley Walk Chepstow to Tintern .",
