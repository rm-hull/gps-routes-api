  "description": "Cross from England into Wales on this walk across the Severn Bridge. The route runs for just under 5 miles from Aust to Chepstow, using fairly flat footpaths, with a moderate climb towards the end. The walk starts from the village of Aust on the eastern side of the river in South Gloucestershire, England. Head west out of the village and you can pick up a section of the Severn Way to take you to the bridge. The iconic suspension bridge was opened on 8 September 1966, by Queen Elizabeth II, replacing the Aust Ferry which had previously transported cars across the river. A shared cycling and walking trail now runs across the bridge, passing Aust Cliff and Aust Rock before coming to Beachley. There's spendid views over the river and surrounding countryside to enjoy on the crossing. At Beachley the final section of the bridge passes over the River Wye, taking you into Chepstow in Wales. The route then picks up a section of the Wales Coast Path to take you along the Wye into Chepstow where the route finishes. To extend the walk you could continue through the Wye Valley and visit the splendid Tintern Abbey on our Wye Valley Walk Chepstow to Tintern .",

Outside there's a lovely garden area if the weather is fine. You can find them at a postcode of BS35 4AX for your sat navs. The inn is also very dog friendly with water bowls and treats readily available for your canine friend."

      "content": "Another popular route in the area is the Severn Beach Walk. This starts from the train station in the village and heads along the sea wall path to the bridge. The walkway has excellent views over the Severn Estuary where you can look out for wildlife including Balearic shearwaters, skua, peregrine falcons and seals. Head north along the river and you could pick up the Oldbury on Severn Walk. This takes you from the little village to the historic Berkeley castle which dates back to the 12th century. Near Oldbury it's also well worth paying a visit to the neighbouring town of Thornbury. It's another attractive local market town and a winner of the Britain in Bloom award. The town has an interesting history too, with a Tudor castle and a noteworthy Norman church to investigate. The circular Thornbury Walk starts from the town castle and visits Littleton-Upon-Severn before heading to the bridge. A few miles to the east you can visit the worthy village of Almondsbury. Here you can enjoy a climb to the excellent viewpoint at Almondsbury hill and visit the notable 12th century church and fine 16th century pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Wye Valley Walks page."
