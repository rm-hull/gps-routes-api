  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this expansive forest in Argyll and Bute. It's a great place for outdoor exercise with a series of pretty lochs, waterfalls, woodland trails and lots of wildlife to look out for. This walking route starts at the Barnluasgan car park and takes you around Loch Coille-Bharr. The car park also gives access to a number of other good cycling and walking trails. You can visit Barnluasgan and Dubh Loch where you can look out for beavers, ospreys, eagles and red squirrels. The whole of this route is designed for walkers but if you follow the western edge of the loch you can pick up a great cycling trail which will take you to Caol Scotnish and the wonderful Loch Sween. To extend your outing head north and pick up the towpath of the Crinan Canal. You can follow the canal all the way to Loch Fyne with great views of the surrounding hills and countryside.",
