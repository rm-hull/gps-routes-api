  "description": "This is a circular walk around the gardens of the beautiful Cragside Estate in Rothbury, Northumberland. On the walk you will pass peaceful woodland, Nelly Moss Lakes and two waterfalls. The grounds also boast the largest rock gardens in Europe, an Iron Bridge, and three acres of stunning formal gardens. Also of note is Nelly's Labyrinth - a network of paths and tunnels cutting through a large rhododendron forest. Cragside house is also well worth exploring - it was the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectricity and is still full of ingenious gadgets. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head a few miles north to Thrunton Woods where there are miles of peaceful woodland trails with views of the Cheviots. The woods sit next to the pretty village of Whittingham where you can enjoy views of the River Aln and see the noteworthy old church which dates back to the 10th century. A walk in the Simonside Hills is also a great option, with miles of walking trails and wonderful views. Our Rothbury Circular Walk will take you up into the hills from the town, with lovely trails through Coquetdale and a visit to the interesting archaeological sites on Garleigh Moor above the town.",

      "content": "The park has a nice on site cafe with a good range of snacks to enjoy after your walk. Another nice option is to head a couple of miles east of the site and visit the pretty little village of Thropton. Here you'll find the excellent Three Wheat Heads Inn. The main advantage here is a wonderful large beer garden with wide ranging views of the surrounding countryside and hills. If the weather is fine it's the ideal spot to relax outside and enjoy a drink. The pub also has an interesting history, dating all the way back to the 18th century. They are dog friendly and do great food in the bar and the restaurant area. You can find the inn on Front Street at postcode NE65 7LR."
