  "description": "These woods near the village of Millthorpe have a nice walking trail and views across Ramsley Moor in the Peak District. There's a car park at the southern end of the woods on Fox Lane. You can pick up the trail from here and follow it through the mature conifer woodland. The walk can be extended by crossing Fox Lane and heading north along Blake Brook on Ramsey Moor. Continue north and you will come to Smeekley Wood and Cockshutts Wood. Footpaths can be followed all the way to the Derbyshire village of Holmesfield and the nearby Holmesfield Woods. Shillito Woods are located a few miles south of Sheffield and not far from Dronfield where you can pick up the Dronfield 2000 Rotary Walk. Also nearby are the climbs to Curbar Edge and Birchen Edge where you can look out for fascinating rock formations and enjoy wonderful views from the elevated position of these wonderful Peak District locations. Ramsley Reservoir is also located just a mile west of the car park.",
