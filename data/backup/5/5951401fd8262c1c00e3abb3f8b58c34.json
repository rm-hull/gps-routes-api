  "description": "This walk takes you to the wonderful Gaping Gill cave from the village of Clapham in the Yorkshire Dales. You can follow lovely paths north along the Clapham Beck to the cave from the village. It's about a 2.5 mile walk along a steadily rising path with some wonderful views over the surrounding area. The cave is located in a splendid spot where Fell Beck flows into a huge hole before crashing 100m to the floor of the cavern and draining through to Ingleborough Cave. It is one of the longest and most complex cave systems in the UK. On the way you will also pass Ingleborough Cave, one of three show caves in the Yorkshire Dales. You can extend the walk by continuing up to Ingleborough mountain where you can enjoy amazing views over the Dales.",
