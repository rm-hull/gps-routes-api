  "description": "This 70 acre park in Leicestershire has some great cycling and walking trails to try. On the eastern side of the park there's waterside trails to pick up along the River Soar and the Grand Union Canal Walk. The meadows are a great spot for wildlife watching with a variety of bird species to see at the site. There's also on site cycle hire at Rutland Cycles. You can extend your cycling by picking up National Cycle Route 6 which runs past the park.",

Head north into Leicester and you could pick up the River Soar Walk and visit the lovely Watermead Country Park where there are a series of lakes to explore. If you head east towards Oadby and Wigston there's a pleasant community orchard and pretty meadows to explore at Brocks Hill Country Park. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks page."
