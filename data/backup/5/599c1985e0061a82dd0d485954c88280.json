  "description": "This small Bedfordshire based village is located in a pleasant rural spot on the River Great Ouse, just south of Sharnbrook . It's a pretty place with an historic parish church, a fine thatched pub, a wildlife rich local nature reserve and an old bridge spanning the River Great Ouse. This walk from the village takes you to the Felmersham Gravel Pits Nature Reserve. The reserve lies just north of the settlement and includes riverside paths, lakes and lots of wildlife. To continue your walking around Felmersham head just a couple of miles west to visit Harrold Odell Country Park . The park includes pleasant cycling and walking trails with river meadows, a nature reserve and two picturesque lakes.",
