  "description": "This Hertfordshire based village is surrounded by some lovely Chilterns countryside which you can explore on two significant long distance trails. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the John Bunyan Trail and the Icknield Way Path to visit the neighbouring village of Barton-le-Clay, the lovely Barton Hills Nature Reserve and the Pegsdon Hills. The walk starts on the western side of the village where you can pick up a footpath heading west to Shillington Moor, just south of Apsley End. Here you can pick up the John Bunyan Trail and follow the waymarked footpath south west to Hexton. The route continues west taking you to the village of Barton-le-Clay. You then head south passing through the village before coming to the Barton Hills. The nature reserve includes some nice trails with good views and lots of wildlife to see. Continue south from the reserve and you will soon come to the Icknield Way Path. The trail will take you north east, passing Deacon Hill in the Pegsdon Hills and then Tingley Wood before returning to Pirton.",
