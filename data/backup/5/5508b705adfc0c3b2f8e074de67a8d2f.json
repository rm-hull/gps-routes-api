  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along the River Deben from Woodbridge to Felixstowe Ferry. There's a nice footpath running for about 12 miles from the town to the Deben estuary on the North Sea. The walk starts on the quay in the Suffolk town of Woodbridge, close to the train station. You then follow a section of the Fynn Valley Walk towards the village of Martlesham. The next section follows public footpaths to Waldringfield where you will find a 14th century church and a pretty beach by the river. It's also a good spot to stop for refreshments at the quayside pub. You continue along the river to Hemley and then through Falkenham marshes before finishing at Felixstowe Ferry. Here you can catch the little ferry over the river to Bawdsey and follow the Suffolk Coast Path east towards Orford Ness . If you follow the path south it will take you into Felixstowe and then on to the splendid Trimley Marshes Nature Reserve, located close to the seaside town of Felixstowe . NB. As of August 2019 there are breaches of the sea wall in two places : 1. South of Martlesham Creek before Cross Farm 2. At Early Creek, south of Waldringfield This means it may nor be possible to walk the full length of this walk along the river. You will need to take a detour by following country lanes to the west of the river, south of Martlesham Creek .",
