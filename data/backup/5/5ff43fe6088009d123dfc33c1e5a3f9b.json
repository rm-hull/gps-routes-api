  "description": "Berry Head Country park is an internationally acclaimed heritage site and National Nature Reserve. It is home to an abundance of coastal wildlife and includes recently restored Napoleonic War fortifications. Look out for lots of interesting flora and fauna including White Rock-Rose, Honewort, Small Hare's Ear, Restharrow and Goldilock's Aste. There is also a large Guillemot colony on the cliffs. This walk takes you to Berry Head and Shoalstone Point on the coast, before crossing Berry Head Common. The park is located in Brixham and is a short walk from the harbour or there are parking facilities at Berry Head. To extend your walk head south along the South West Coast Path to the lovely Sharkham Point Nature Reserve. Here you can enjoy great views of St Mary's Bay and look out for dolphins in the water below. You could also try the popular Paignton to Brixham Walk which visits a series of pretty beaches and secluded coves.",

The building has an interesting history having been completed in 1802 and used by the troops defending the fortress. Inside the caf\u00e9 you can still see part of the tunnel system which was built inside the fort all those years ago. There's lots of outdoor seating where you can enjoy a cream tea with magnificent coastal views on a warm day."
