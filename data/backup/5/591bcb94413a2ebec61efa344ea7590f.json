  "description": "This small Devon village is located near Exeter and the valley of the River Teign . This walk from the village visits the nearby Haldon Forest Park and Haldon Belvedere (Lawrence Castle). The castle is located just a couple of miles south east of the village. It is used as wedding venue but is also open to the public on certain days. The fine looking castle dates from 1788 and is surrounded by some the lovely grounds and gardens. From the castle it is a short walk south to Haldon Forest Park. Another local highlight the expansive forest park includes miles of cycling and walking trails. There's also a splendid viewpoint with birds of prey to see and views over Exeter and Dartmoor.",
