  "description": "This small East Sussex town is a fine place for a historical walk. The town has a rich and fascinating history with several medieval buildings to see. This includes the three medieval gates, an ancient church and the Court Hall which is now a museum. This circular walk from Winchelsea visits Nook Beach and Winchelsea Beach before picking up a section of the Royal Military Canal Path to return you to the town. Start the walk from the town centre and then follow country lanes south east to Nook Beach on the edge of the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. You can explore the reserve further on various public footpaths by heading further east from here. Here you will find a number of pretty lakes with a large variety of wildlife to look out for. This walk continues south east to the beach where you head south west towards the picturesque Colonel Body Memorial Lakes. Near here you can pick up sections of the Royal Military Canal Path and the Saxon Shore Way. Follow the waymarked trails north east along the easy waterside footpath and they will lead you back into Winchelsea. You can extend the walk by continuing south west along the beach to visit Fairlight Cove where there's some excellent cliff tops sea views to enjoy.",
