  "description": "Visit the fascinating 13th century Beaumaris Castle and then enjoy a coastal section on this walk in the town of Beaumaris in Anglesey. The castle was built by Edward I towards the end of the 13th century in order to stamp his authority on the Welsh. However, it was never fully completed with money and supplies running out before the fortifications were finished. It's a hugely impressive sight with UNESCO considering Beaumaris to be one of 'the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe'. They have classed it as a World Heritage site. After exploring the castle you can enjoy a walk along the Anglesey Coast Path towards Fryars Bay. There's great views over the Menai Strait towards Lavan Sands, Ceredigion and Snowdonia. You can turn it into a longer circular walk by heading into the countryside and returning on country lanes to the town. From Beaumaris you can take a boat trip to visit Puffin Island. You can extend your walk by continuing north along the Anglesey Coast Path to Penmon Point. Here you'll find the Trwyn Du Lighthouse and great views towards Puffin Island, Great Orme and Snowdon. There's also nice pebble beaches and seals and dolphins to look out for.",
