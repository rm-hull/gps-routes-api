  "description": "Colyton has some lovely walks through the River Coly Valley within the wider East Devon AONB. It's an attractive Saxon town with a number of historical buildings, an old Market Place and a popular heritage tramway to see. This walk from the town takes you along the River Coly before climbing to a nice viewpoint on Parehayne Hill above the town. The circular walk starts in the town where you can pick up the East Devon Way and follow it west along the river. You will pass a weir and ford before coming to Heathhayne. The trail continues towards Barritshayes where you leave the river to follow country lanes north to Rockerhayne. Tracks then bend round to take you up to Crookham Cross and Parehayne Hill. There's fine views over the East Devon AONB towards Dorset and the coast from this elevated position. From Parehayne you descend on country lanes to Carswells Moor on the Downhayne Brake Road. This will eventually lead you back to the river which you then follow east into the town.",
