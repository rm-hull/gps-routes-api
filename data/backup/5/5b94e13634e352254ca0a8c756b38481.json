  "description": "This Surrey town has a number of fine walking trails to try, particularly just to the east of the town centre. Here you can enjoy canalside walks along the River Wey Navigation, visit the lovely Pyrford Lock or enjoy 800 acres of heathland and woodland at Wisley and Ockham Common. Near here you will also find the renowned RHS Wisley Gardens and the delightful Painshill Park. To the north of the town there's miles of trails on the expansive Horsell Common, while to the west there's a nice footpath around Goldsworth Park Lake. The Basingstoke Canal also runs right through the town. This pleasant walk picks up the towpath in the town centre and heads west towards Farnborough and Frimley Green. It's an easy 8 mile walk finishing at Frimley Lodge Park which includes a miniature railway. If you were to head in the other direction along the canal from the town centre, it would take you toward Weybridge where the canal joins with the River Wey Navigation. You could then follow this a short distance to the Thames Path. It's a lovely section of the river with the option of following the National Trail to Chertsey and Staines.",
