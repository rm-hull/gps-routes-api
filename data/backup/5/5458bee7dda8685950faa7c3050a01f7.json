This statue stands on Slievenamuck and overlooks the valley, offering breathtaking views of the Glen of Aherlow. The site is particularly popular during the summer, attracting visitors to the car park at the statue, which serves as a viewing point on the approach to Tipperary Town. The statue and the glen continue to be symbols of the area's rich history and natural beauty."

The Glen of Aherlow is steeped in folklore, particularly associated with Geoffrey Keating, a prominent figure in Irish history. Keating, a 17th-century historian and priest, is believed to have found refuge in the glen while compiling his famous work, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn, which chronicles the history of Ireland. Local tradition suggests that Keating preached and lived in a cave in the area while evading authorities."
