  "description": "Follow the Wetherby Railway Path from Wetherby to Spofforth on this easy walk or cycle in Yorkshire. The route is also known as the Harland Way and runs for about 3 miles along a now disused railway line and Sustrans National Cycle Route 67. It starts with a tree lined section before opening out into the countryside with nice views of the surrounding farmland. You then come to the pretty village of Spofforth where there's some nice 18th century cottages and the fascinating Spofforth Castle. It's well worth spending some time strolling round the ruined castle. The former manor house was built by Henry de Percy in the early 14th century. It was later ruined during the English Civil War and is now run by English Heritage as a tourist attraction. After exploring the castle you can head into Spoforth village and enjoy refreshments at one of the nice village pubs. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you can pick up the Ebor Way in Wetherby. Following the trail west will take you through the lovely Wharfedale to Harewood House .",
