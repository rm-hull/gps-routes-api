It's also a designated nature reserve with lots of interesting flora and fauna. \u00a0Look out for various wildflowers and birdlife including wildfowl on the lake and skylarks in the air. The park is located near to Cleethorpes town centre and the sea front so you could continue your walk or ride along the coast. Just east is the Cleethorpes nature reserve with a discovery centre and a pretty lake next to the coast.",
