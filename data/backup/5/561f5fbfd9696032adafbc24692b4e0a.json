Look out for various wildflowers and birdlife including wildfowl on the lake and skylarks in the air. The park is located near to Cleethorpes town centre and the sea front so you could continue your walk or ride along the coast. Just east is the Cleethorpes nature reserve with a discovery centre and a pretty lake next to the coast.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area head south and try the Cleethorpes to Tetney Lock Walk. The walk takes you along the Tetney Marshes RSPB nature reserve to the pretty lock on the Louth Canal. Also nearby is Weelsby Woods. This popular park has some nice surfaced footpaths taking you to mature trees, woodland, and large grassy areas. The Grimsby Walk starts from the train station in the town and visits the interesting National Fishing Heritage Centre at Alexandra Dock. The museum transports you back in time to the 1950\u2019s heyday of this famous port. If you head a few miles inland you could pick up the Wanderlust Way around the little village of Barnoldby le Beck. The 20 mile circular walk explores the Lincolnshire Wolds and includes views of the Humber Estuary. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lincolnshire Walks page."
