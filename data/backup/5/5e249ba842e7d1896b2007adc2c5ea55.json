    "description": "This walk visits the popular Sutton Manor Woodland Park in St Helens . The park has been constructed on the site of the old Sutton Manor Colliery and includes a number of pleasant footpaths. On the site you'll also find a fine viewpoint with the eye catching 'Dream Sculpture' as the centrepiece of the park. The 20 metre high white sculpture is quite a sight and one of the highlights of the area. It's easy to extend the walk by heading a short distance to the east where you'll find Clock Face Country Park . There's more well maintained paths and a lake with a fishery here. A little further afield to the west is Stadt Moers Park where there's 220 acres to explore on bike or foot.",
