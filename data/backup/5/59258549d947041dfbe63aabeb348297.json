  "description": "These attractive woods are located a few miles west of Canterbury, near the delightful village of Chilham, and on the dip slope of the North Downs and the Kent Downs AONB. There are miles of footpaths to follow around the site with a wide variety of flora and fauna to look out for on the way. This circular walk starts from Chilham where there is a train station just to the east of the village. From here you can follow footpaths south over the River Great Stour to the expansive woods. The site includes a number of different type of orchid and are an important habitat for nesting and migratory birds including the nightingale, chiffchaff, and spotted flycatcher. You may also see fallow deer and roe deer if you are fortunate. There's great scope for continuing your walk if you have time. Eggringe Woods are located just to the south of Denge Woods. There's also a small car park here if you wished to start your walk from an alternative location. The waymarked Stour Valley Walk skirts the northern edge of the woods. You could pick up the trail and follow waterside trails to the lovely Chilham Lake where there is a beauitful old watermill. The North Downs Way also passes nearby and is a great way of exploring the surrounding countryside on a well maintained path.",
