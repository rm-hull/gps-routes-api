The mill features\u00a0four double Patent sails, each spanning\u00a063 feet (19.20 meters), and they are mounted on a\u00a0cast-iron windshaft\u00a0that was\u00a0crafted in 1989\u00a0(the original windshaft was cast in two pieces). The\u00a0brake wheel\u00a0is made of wood and powers a\u00a0cast-iron wallower, which is supported by a\u00a0wooden upright shaft. Additionally, the wooden\u00a0great spur wheel\u00a0drives\u00a0two pairs of overdrift millstones, while a\u00a0wooden crownwheel\u00a0on the upright shaft operates a\u00a0sack hoist."

      "caption": "The Stones in Bardwell Windmill. The Mill, constructed in\u00a01823, initially operated using wind power until\u00a01925. Later, it switched to a\u00a0Blackstone oil engine\u00a0until\u00a01941. The mill fell into disrepair by\u00a01978, but James Waterfield purchased it and successfully restored it by\u00a01985. Subsequently, Geoffrey and Enid Wheeler acquired the mill in\u00a0July 1987. Unfortunately, on\u00a0October 16, 1987, a gear disengagement incident caused the windshaft to shear at the rear of the canister, resulting in the sails crashing to the ground. Despite limited funds, restoration efforts resumed in\u00a01989. Geoffrey Wheeler\u2019s passing in\u00a01995\u00a0led to the establishment of\u00a0The Friends of Bardwell Windmill\u00a0in\u00a01997. With contributions from English Heritage and St Edmundsbury Borough Council, the estimated \u00a392,000 restoration cost was partially covered. In\u00a02004, a replacement cap, cast iron windshaft, and fantail were installed.\u00a0Due to cost considerations, volunteer labor crafted the new sails, with the first pair completed by late summer\u00a02008\u00a0and the second pair fitted in\u00a0April 2012"

      "caption": "Medieval parish church. Within the churchyard lies the grave of\u00a0Henry Addison, a Bardwell native born in\u00a01821. Addison\u2019s valor during the\u00a0Indian Mutiny\u00a0earned him the prestigious\u00a0Victoria Cross\u00a0while serving in the British Army. Remarkably, he returned safely to Bardwell and lived until\u00a01887, reaching the age of\u00a066.\nThe church of\u00a0St. Peter and Paul\u00a0boasts a set of\u00a0eight bells, a notable feature. Interestingly, this contradicts the name of the local pub, which goes by the\u00a0Six Bells. The largest bell weighs an impressive\u00a011 hundredweight, 2 quarters, and 27 pounds. The\u00a0oldest bell, the seventh in the set, was cast in\u00a01713\u00a0by\u00a0Thomas Newman. In\u00a02009, restoration efforts led by\u00a0Hayward Mills\u00a0resulted in the addition of two new bells, ensuring that the church\u2019s melodic chimes continue to resonate through Bardwell.\nBardwell Church St. Peter and Paul\u00a0stands as a testament to the village\u2019s rich history and architectural heritage, having been originally built by\u00a0Sir William Bardwell\u00a0himself."
