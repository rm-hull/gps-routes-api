  "description": "This long distance route follows the old Roman Roads from the Ae Forest to Hawick. Though classed as a walking route much of the trail is also suitable for cyclists with mile of forestry trails to enjoy. It runs for just over 50 miles, passing through some lovely Dumfries and Galloway countryside before arriving in the Scottish Borders at Hawick. The route starts at the car park at the southern end of the expansive Ae Forest. Head north along the woodland trails to Beattock Hill before crossing Moffat Water south of Moffat . Here the route links up with the Annandale Way which takes you to the Solway Coast through the valley of the River Annan. You then head east through forestry along a section of the Southern Upland Way . You'll pass along the pretty streams and burns of the Eskdalemuir Forest before heading through the adjacent Craik Forest. After emerging from the forest you continue east to Roberton before finishing at Wiltonburn Hill, just outside Hawick.",
