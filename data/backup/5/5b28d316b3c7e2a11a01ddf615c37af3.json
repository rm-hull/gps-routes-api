Originally one of three lighthouses, the third the Wyre Light, designed by blind engineer Alexander Mitchell is set 2 miles off the coast. Unfortunately it was decommissioned in 1979 and has been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair."

  "description": "This Lancashire coastal town is located a few miles north of the popular seaside resort of Blackpool. There's some nice coastal trails, beach walks, a local country park and good riverside paths along the Wyre estuary to enjoy here. This circular walk from the town uses sections of the Lancashire Coastal Way and the Wyre Way to visit Wyre Estuary Country Park and the town of Knott End on the opposite side of the river estuary. The walk starts on the sea front where you can pick up the Lancashire Coastal Way and follow the waymarked footpath west along the beach and the boating pool. You continue to Rossall Point where you turn south towards the Rossall School and Beach. Here you turn inland on the Wyre Way which will take you past the Barnaby's Sands Nature Reserve to the River Wyre. You can then follow a riverside footpath south to the Wyre Estuary Country Park. The route continues through Thornton where you cross the river to head north to Hambleton. The trail will take you to Knott End, passing through the golf course before arriving at the town. Here you can catch the ferry back over to Fleetwood where the walk finishes. You could extend the walk by heading east along the coast path from Knott End to Pilling. It's a lovely footpath with fine views towards the Lake District Hills on a clear day.",

It's a large semi-circular building opened in 1841 and designed by the foremost architect of the day, Decimus Burton. It derives its name from the fact that it stood at the end of the railway line from London Euston. From the hotel there are fine views over the Wyre estuary to Morecambe Bay and the Lake District. Inside there's the stylish Bay Restaurant or Victoria Bar for post walk refreshment. You can find them on the front, close to the tram and bus stop with a postcode of FY7 6BN for your sat navs."
