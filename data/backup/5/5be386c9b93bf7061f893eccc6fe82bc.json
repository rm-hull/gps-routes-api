  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir in Coleshill, Warwickshire. A good footpath runs around the perimeter of the water, with woodland and wildfowers around the water's edge. The River Bourne also runs through the site. You can start your outing from the public car park at the south western end of the water, close to Shustoke village. The Heart of England Way and the Warwickshire Centenary Way both pass the reservoir so you could pick up one of these long distance trails to extend your walk.  Cyclists can reach the reservoir on the North Warwickshire Cycle Way.",
