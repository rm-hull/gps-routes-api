Taken by a siege commanded by the Duke of Norfolk in 1469, the castle was returned to its rightful owners in 1475. Part of the surrounding brick wall remains and gunloops as well as arrow loops can still be seen. The castle grounds house the largest private collection of motor vehicles in Great Britain spanning from 1893 to the present time and including the first real motor car in the world, the 1893 Panhard et Levassor, Jim Clark's Grand Prix \"R14', Christine Keeler's Cadillac Eldorado, the first Ford Fiesta and the last drophead Morris 1000."

  "description": "This walk visits the Norfolk seaside resort of Caister-On-Sea. The resort is located just to the north of Great Yarmouth and includes a fine sandy beach. From the village you can follow a coastal footpath north along the beach to visit nearby California. There's some lovely sea views and views of the town to enjoy along the way. If you continue north along the Norfolk Coast Path it will take you towards Hemsby and Winterton on Sea where there is a splendid dunes system and nature reserve. Near here there's also Horsey Windpump and Horsey Mere where there's an historic old mill and lakeside trails. To continue your walking around the village head west to visit Caister Castle. The 15th century ruined fortification includes an ancient tower with some marvellous views from the top.",
