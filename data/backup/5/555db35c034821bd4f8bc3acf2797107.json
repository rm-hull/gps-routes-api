  "description": "These spectacular falls near Aberystwyth have a lovely nature trail to try. The trail includes a visit to the imposing Jacob's Ladder. This steep series of stone steps is quite challenging so good footwear and a head for heights is required. The effort is well worthwhile with wonderful scenery and the gushing water of the falls to enjoy. There's several viewpoints along the way and a nearby hotel where you can stop for refreshments after your walk. There is car parking right next to the falls but you can also come by the Vale of Rheidol Steam Railway which departs from Aberystwyth. To extend your walk you can explore the Coed Rheidol National Nature Reserve. Here you will find woodland trails and more waterfalls. Just follow the footpaths north west from Devil's Bridge, taking you through the woods to the Afon Rheidol. There's also lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for in the expansive reserve. For some nice woodland footpaths and challenging mountain bike trails head to the nearby Nant Y Arian. The large forest is located just a few miles north west of Devil's Bridge and a great place to extend your exercise. Also in the Ceredigion region is the lovely Cors Caron Nature Reserve. The pretty reserve includes reedbeds, grasslands, woodland, rivers, streams and ponds. In Aberystwyth you can enjoy a climb to Constitution Hill and pick up the long distance Ceredigion Coast Path .",

They have a bar and brasserie with excellent food and they provide good quality accommodation if you need to stay over. There's also a nice outdoor seating area to relax in if the weather is fine."

There's great views of the Cambrian Mountains and you can look out for Red Kite and Buzzards on the journey too. Just to the south east there's the Hafod Estate to explore. The National Trust managed estate includes miles of woodland trails through the lovely Ystwyth valley. There's riverside trails, cascading waterfalls, restored gardens and lots of wildlife to see here."
