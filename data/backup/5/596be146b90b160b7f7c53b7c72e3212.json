John Kyrle created The Prospect, offering magnificent vistas overlooking the Wye River, which lies a hundred feet below, extending all the way to the Welsh mountains. He rented this parcel of land from the Marquess of Bath in 1696 and transformed it into a garden and leisure area. Around 1870, disputes arose over land ownership. James Barrett constructed the Royal Hotel and appropriated part of The Prospect to establish gardens for the hotel. This action led to significant unrest among the residents of Ross, who believed that The Prospect belonged to the town and accused Barrett of unjustly claiming the land. Eventually, Thomas Blake intervened and resolved the conflict by arranging for the land to be permanently transferred to the townspeople. Subsequently, the garden was laid out in a manner similar to its present-day configuration."

Taken during the 2000 British Relay Championships in Orienteering. The ruins of Penyard Castle can be found in this area. Dating back to the 14th century, the castle was once owned by the Talbot family and is believed to have been demolished in the late 17th century. The surviving ruins consist of a single building, likely a portion of the original castle's residential quarters, displaying medieval features. Constructed partly with recycled masonry from the original castle, this small structure underwent extensive modifications and remained inhabited until the early 20th century. Oriented in a north-south direction, it features gable walls at both ends connected by walls on the east and west sides, with a dilapidated extension protruding from the east side."
