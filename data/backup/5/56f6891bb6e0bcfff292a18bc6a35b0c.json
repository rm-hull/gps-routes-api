  "description": "A circular walk around the town of Ilminster, visiting the River Isle and the countryside surrounding the town. The town is located in south west Somerset, just to the east of the Blackdown Hills. The route starts in the town centre and follows a public footpath west through the countryside to Cold Harbour and the River Isle. Here you can follow a public footpath north along the river for about a mile. You then leave the river and follow other paths through Winterhay Green to return to the town. It's a pretty area with farmland surrounding the river and views towards the Blackdown Hills to enjoy.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area head west from the town to visit Castle Neroche. Here you'll find woodland trails and the site of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle and Iron Age Hillfort. The site also commands fine views over the Quantock Hills and Mendips. The long distance Staple Fitzpaine Herepath can be picked up at the park at the castle. The shared cycling and walking bridleway will take you to Thurlbear Wood where there's some fine ancient woodland, wildflowers and lots of wildlife to see. If you head south of the town you can enjoy some more nice waterside trails around Chard Reservoir. Head east and you can pick up the River Parret Trail near South Petherton. Just to the north east of the town there's the lovely Dillington House to visit. The 16th century house is surrounded by beautiful parkland, woodland and gardens. For more walks in the AONB see the Blackdown Hills Walks page."
