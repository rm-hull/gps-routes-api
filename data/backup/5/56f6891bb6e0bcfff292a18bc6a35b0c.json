    "description": "A circular walk around the town of Ilminster, visiting the River Isle and the countryside surrounding the town. The town is located in south west Somerset, just to the east of the Blackdown Hills. The route starts in the town centre and follows a public footpath west through the countryside to Cold Harbour and the River Isle. Here you can follow a public footpath north along the river for about a mile. You then leave the river and follow other paths through Winterhay Green to return to the town. It's a pretty area with farmland surrounding the river and views towards the Blackdown Hills to enjoy.",
