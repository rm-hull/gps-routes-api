  "description": "This 19th century garden near Sevenoaks contains many exotic trees and shrubs from around the world. From its elevated position there are fabulous views over the Weald of Kent and the North Downs. Well laid out footpaths take you to an arboretum, exotic shrubs, rose garden and a rock garden. Other highlights include a lily pond and bluebell woodland. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to Toys Hill for more woodland trails and more great views. Chartwell House is located just to the west and has more nice trails through lovely parkland and gardens. Our 8 mile Westerham Circular Walk visits Chartwell, Toys Hill and the gardens from the town centre.",
