  "description": "This splendid walking trail runs right along the spine of the Preseli Hills giving wonderful views of the area. On a clear day you can see Cardigan Bay, Snowdonia and even Ireland. You will also pass two quarries which are believed to have provided the stones for Stonehenge. The road is thought to date back to Neolithic times. It's a 7 mile linear route but you could turn it into a circular walk by following the country lane at the end of the route south east towards Rosebush and then turning north through the Pantmaenog Forest to return to the start point. The walk starts at the Bwlch Gwynt car park on the B4329 and heads east following the trail past the northern end of the Pantmeanog Forest. Here you have the option to take a short detour south to Foel Cwmcerwyn, the highest point in the Presili Hills. You continue east to the Bronze Age burial cairn at Foel Feddau and then on to the rocky tor Carn Bica, which overlooks Bedd Arthur, a Neolithic ring of stones in the shape of an eye. The final section takes you past the Foel Drygarn Iron Age fortress before finishing near Crymych. On the route you can look out for wildlife such as buzzard, red kite and wild ponies on the grassland.",

      "content": "The village of Crymych is located just to the east of the end of the route. You could head to the Crymych Arms Inn and enjoy refreshments at the end of your walk. It's a friendly pub with a good menu and drinks selection. You can find them at postcode SA41 3RJ. At the other end of the route there's the village of Rosebush and the noteworthy Tafarn Sinc. The building dates back to 1876 and, unusually for pubs, is constructed of corrugated metal. It originally served the adjacent Rosebush railway station on the Maenclochog Railway, which opened in 1876. Both were built as part of the development of the slate quarry. In 2017, after the owners decided to sell, it was bought by a community group of local residents and other shareholders. The scheme was promoted by actor Rhys Ifans, who was born locally. The pub has a splendidly authentic interior with sawdust on the floorboards and lots of railway memorabilia. Outside there's a lovely garden area with views of the surrounding countryside. You can find them at postcode SA66 7QU for your sat navs. The inn is dog friendly and has a car parking area."

The site's unusual landscape includes hidden pools, an arched underground tunnel, steep cliff faces, heath, grassland and pine trees. From the car park at the start of the walk you can climb west to Foel Eryr. There's a Bronze Age cairn and a toposcope at the 468 metre high summit of this worthy hill."
