    "description": "This splendid walking trail runs right along the spine of the Preseli Hills giving wonderful views of the area. On a clear day you can see Cardigan Bay, Snowdonia and even Ireland. You will also pass two quarries which are believed to have provided the stones for Stonehenge. The road is thought to date back to Neolithic times. It's a 7 mile linear route but you could turn it into a circular walk by following the country lane at the end of the route south east towards Rosebush and then turning north through the Pantmaenog Forest to return to the start point. The walk starts at the Bwlch Gwynt car park on the B4329 and heads east following the trail past the northern end of the Pantmeanog Forest. Here you have the option to take a short detour south to Foel Cwmcerwyn , the highest point in the Presili Hills. You continue east to the Bronze Age burial cairn at Foel Feddau and then on to the rocky tor Carn Bica, which overlooks Bedd Arthur, a Neolithic ring of stones in the shape of an eye. The final section takes you past the Foel Drygarn Iron Age fortress before finishing near Crymych. On the route you can look out for wildlife such as buzzard, red kite and wild ponies on the grassland.",
