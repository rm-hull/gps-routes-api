  "description": "The cathedral city of Wells is located in North Somerset in the Mendip Hills AONB. The city includes many historical buildings including the moated Bishop's Palace and the magnificent cathedral. There's lots of good walking opportunities around the city with woodland, nature reserves, hill climbs and parks to visit. This circular walk from the city takes you to two of the highlights to the north of Wells. You'll visit the famous caves at Wookey Hole before continuing on to the Ebbor Gorge Nature Reserve. The route runs for a distance of a distance of about 6 miles using a section of the waymarked West Mendip Way and other public footpaths. The walk starts from the architectural wonder of Wells Cathedral where you can pick up the West Mendip Way and follow it north west through the city and out into the countryside. You'll pass woodland around Milton Hill and Arthur's Point before coming to the village of Wookey Hole. Just to the north of the village you'll pass the paper mill and the Wookey Hole Caves. For a fee you can explore the caves which have been used by humans for around 45,000 years. This includes a show cave with a dry gallery connecting three large chambers, the first of which contains the striking Witch of Wookey formation. The attraction also includes some lovely woodland walks through the valley with views of the River Axe. After passing the caves the route continues north and then west, climbing up to Ebbor Rocks. It's a fair climb but you are rewarded with excellent views over the surrounding countryside from the top. The area is also a nature reserve with a variety of interesting plants and flowers. There's also pretty streams and lots of interesting rock formations. The route then loops through the gorge before heading back to Wookey Hole and Lower Milton. Other trails then lead you back into Wells where the route finishes.",
