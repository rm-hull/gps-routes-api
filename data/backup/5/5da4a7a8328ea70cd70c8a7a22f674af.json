  "description": "This Warickshire based village is in a fine location for canal, country and lakeside walking. There's also some interesting buildings with a 12th century church and an old tower mill to see. After your exercise you can relax in the local canalside village pub. This circular walk from the village takes you along the Oxford Canal to neighbouring Lower Shuckburgh before following country lanes back to the village. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north west towards Napton Hill and the windmill. Shortly after you link up with the canal and follow it east to Napton Marina and Napton Junction where the Oxford Canal links with the Grand Union Canal. You could take a detour here and head north to visit the pretty Calcutt Locks and marina. The Napton Reservoirs are also in this area. This walk continues east to Nimrod Bridge and Lower Shuckburgh. Here you leave the canal and follow country lanes south east past the Shuckburgh Hills. The route then turns west to follow footpaths back into Napton. For more information on the village including the historic parish church, economic and social history, the Napton Music Festival and Notable Residents please see the handy wikipedia entry.",
