  "description": "Located on the edge of Swindon is this splendid park with 260 acres of lawns, woodlands and pasture for visitors to walk or cycle through. Here you will find the beautifully-restored State Rooms of Lydiard House, with its original furnishings and portrait gallery. There is also an ornamental fruit and flower Walled Garden and a children's play area. To continue your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Mouldon Hill Country Park. Here you'll find a pretty lake, the River Ray, a section of the North Wilts Canal and nice views from the park's high points. About a mile to the north east you'll find Shaw Forest Park. The park has nice footpaths with ash/willow woodland, wildflower meadows, grassland and ponds. There's also Peatmoor Lake where there is a nice walking trail to try. Our circular Swindon Cycle Route visits all these parks using signed cycle routes which run through the town.",
