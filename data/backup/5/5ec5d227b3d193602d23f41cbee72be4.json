  "description": "This route visits Grenoside and Greno Woods in Sheffield. The area of ancient woodland is also a nature reserve and a great place for flora and fauna. On your visit look out for woodland wildflowers including bluebells, honeysuckle and common cow-wheat. It's also great for birdwatching with wren, cuckoos, willow warbler, blackcap, chiffchaff and tree pipit to see. The woods are a popular place for mountain bikers and walkers with a network of trails to follow. The open street map below shows the mountain bike trails in blue. These include the DH3, Pub Run and Steel City DH. The MTB jumps area can be seen on the eastern side of the woods near Sandy Lane. The video below showcases the trails you will find at the site. You can start off from the car park at 4 Woodhead Rd, Wood Seats, Sheffield S35 8RS. From here you can pick up the trails head east into the woods.",
