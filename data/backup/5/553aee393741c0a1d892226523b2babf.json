  "description": "This walk or cycle climbs to Bignor Hill from the village of Amberley in West Sussex. It's a moderate climb of about 3.5 miles, following the South Downs Way for the duration of the route. It's a good path which is also suitable for cycling. If you prefer a shorter walk then you could park at the car park just half a mile west of the hill, and start your climb from there. This route starts off from Amberley train station, following a section of the River Arun out of the village. The waymarked path then heads west, past Coombe Wood before skirting the northern edge of Houghton Forest . You then climb past Bury Hill and Westburton Hill before arriving at the Bignor Hill summit. At over 700ft the hill commands wonderful views over the South Downs to the coast. To extend the walk you could follow the Monarch's Way south west along the Stane Street Roman Road to visit Eartham Woods . To turn it into a circular route you could head south east into Houghton Forest and return on the woodland trails to the village. You could also explore the countryside around the village on our Amberley Circular Walk .",
