  "description": "This Sussex based village is a delightful place for a stroll. There's a pretty village green, a millpond and a number of historic timber framed properties to admire. There's also the quintessentially English cricket pitch, a fine country pub and the noteworthy St Laurence church which still has evidence of the original Saxon structure. This circular walk from the village visits one of the highlights of the area at Black Down. Here you can climb to the highest point on the South Downs. The National Trust owned area includes miles of woodland trails and wonderful viewpoints. It's located just a few miles north of Lurgashall and can be reached by following footpaths to Windfallwood Common and then up to the Temple of the Four Winds viewpoint. The route uses part of the Sussex Border Path which can be used to further explore the area. Following it west would take you to Marley Common just south of Haslemere .",
