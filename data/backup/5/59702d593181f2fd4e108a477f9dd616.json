  "description": "This walk visits the Eycott Hill Nature Reserve near Penrith in Cumbria. The reserve includes some eye catching wildflowers and rare species of plantlife such as mountain pansy and mountain everlasting. It's also great for wildlife with curlew, snipe, meadow pipit, skylark and wheatear to look out for. The landscape is striking with volcanic activity from millions of years ago visible today. From the reserve's elevated position there are great views towards the surrounding fells of the Lake District. You can start the walk from the car parking area at Berrier and then pick up the trails heading west to climb to the top of the hill which stands at 345 metres. To the north there's also Little Eycott Hill to climb if you have time. To continue your walking in the area head a short distance west to Mungrisdale where you can enjoy a climb to The Tongue and Bowscale Fell which lie just to the west of the settlement. Just to the south there's another fine viewpoint at Great Mell Fell .",
