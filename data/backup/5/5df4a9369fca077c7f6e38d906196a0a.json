  "description": "Visit the highest point on the Mendip Way and enjoy a stroll through Cranmore Wood on this circular walk in Somerset. The tower is 45 metres (148 ft) tall and dates from the 19th century. You can climb to a viewing platform where you can enjoy views over the Mendip Hills. The surrounding woods have some nice footpaths with beech trees and bluebells in the spring. Look out for badgers, rabbits and deer in this area. The tower has a tea room attached to it for refreshments after your walk. You can park at the tower and explore the hill top from there. Alternatively you could follow the East Mendip Way from nearby Shepton Mallet to reach the tower. It's about a three mile walk through Chelynch and Waterlip. To extend your walk from the tower you can pick up the East Mendip Way long distance path which crosses the hill. You could head west towards Shepton Mallet and visit the Charlton Viaduct and enjoy a walk along the River Sheppey to Kilver Court Gardens. Head east and you can visit Asham Wood and the picturesque town of Frome .",
