  "description": "A short stroll along the River Usk in the town of Crickhowell (Crug Hywel) in the Brecon Beacons. The walk starts next to Crickhowell Castle also known as 'Alisby's Castle'. The ruined castle dates from the 12th century and is now Grade I listed. From here it is a short walk down to the river where you will pass the impressive Crickhowell bridge. The 18th-century bridge is claimed to be the longest stone bridge in Wales at over 128 metres (420 ft). Turn west at the bridge and you can follow a footpath along the northern side of the river for just over a mile. You have the option of continuing west to Glanusk Park where there is a nice permissive path to follow through the large estate. The town is in a great location for exploring the Brecon Beacons and the Black Mountains. Many people climb to Table Mountain and Pen Cerrig Calch on the epic Cambrian Way from the the town. The mountain gives its name to the town as it is also known as Crug Hywel. You can also pick up the Usk Valley Walk and the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal to the south of the town. You can follow the canal and the river west to to uk/routes/home.nsf/RoutesLinksCycle/talybont-reservoir-walking-and-cycle-route'>Talybont Reservoir, Llangynidr on the Crickhowell Canal Walk. In the neighbouring village you can see Llangynidr Locks and Llangynidr Bridge which dates from 1700. There's also the lovely Talybont Reservoir to visit beyond Llangynidr. Heading south along the canal will take you to the pretty Gilwern Wharf where there's some lovely scenery and a fine canalside pub.",
