  "description": "This is a circular walk or cycle ride around Westbury in Buckinghamshire. Route highlights include Turweston Airfield and Biddlesden House and Park. The house occupies the site of a Cistercian Abbey, founded in 1147 and sits behind a small lake. There's also some lovely countryside and views of the River Great Ouse to enjoy. The route mainly follows country lanes and bridleways so for cyclists a mountain bike or hybrid is required.",
