The route takes you to the\u00a0RAF Pathfinder stations at Wyton, Graveley, Oakington and Warboys . You start from the Wyton Airfield, just east of Huntingdon and west of St Ives . Wyton was the Group Headquarters and has been a military airfield since 1916, when it was used for training by the\u00a0Royal Flying Corps\u00a0and then its successor the\u00a0Royal Air Force. The 46 mile route then takes you through the countryside, visiting a number of pretty villages on the way.",
