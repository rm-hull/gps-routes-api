  "description": "The Lancashire town of Earby is located near Colne and Barnoldswick on the Lancashire / Yorkshire border. This circular walk from the settlement visits the lovely Earby Waterfalls Park before exploring the area surrounding the town. On the way you'll follow a section of the Pendle Way footpath and enjoy a waterside stretch along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The waterfalls park is located just to the east of the town on the pretty Wencliffe Brook. It's a lovely area for a stroll with public footpaths and a picnic area. After exploring the falls you'll go on to visit Kelbrook, Salterforth, Barnoldswick and Thornton-in-Craven.",
