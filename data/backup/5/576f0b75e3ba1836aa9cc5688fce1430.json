  "description": "Urra Moor is the highest moor in the North York Moors and an atmospheric and beautiful place for a walk. This route takes you to the high point at Round Hill which reaches a height of 454 metres (1,454 ft) above sea level. There's some wonderful moorland scenery with the lovely purple heather in the late summer months. There's also far reaching views across the national park from the elevated position of the moor. You can start the walk from the Clay Bank car park just to the north of the moor. The route then follows a section of the Lyke Wake Walk across Carr Ridge to Round Hill. The route then turns west to Medd Crag before returning north to Cowkill Well. From here it is a short distance back to the car park. On your walk look out for some interesting carved rocks including the Face Stone, a carved stone about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) in height into which has been carved the shape of a face. To extend your walking in the area you could try the Wainstones walk which also starts at the Clay Bank car park. The stones are a series of fascinating sandstone rocky outcrops with a number of interesting Bronze Age carvings. They are located just a mile west of the start/finish point for this walk so are easy to visit. Just next to the Wainstones you will find Lord Stones Country Park. Here you will find a number of ancient stones with prehistoric carvings. There's also a fantastic viewpoint on Cringle Moor with a viewfinder detailing several landmarks you can see. Two long distance paths also pass Urra Moor. You can pick up the Cleveland Way and the Lyke Wake Walk to further explore this lovely area on the moors.",
