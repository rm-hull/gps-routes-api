  "description": "This walk climbs to an interesting art structure and viewpoint in Haslingden, Lancashire. Start the walk from the car park on Cribden End Lane, just to the north east of Haslingden. From here you can follow footpaths up to the summit where you will find the structure. The steel artwork was constructed in 2007 and is visible for miles around, particularly at night when it becomes illuminated. It sits on Top o' Slate a former quarry which now makes an excellent viewpoint over the Rossendale Valley below.",

You can also pick up the Oswaldtwistle Walk here and explore Oswaldtwistle Moor and the beautiful Valley of Haslingden Grane. For another local climb head to Musbury Tor. Also known as Tor Hill this fine viewpoint commands fine views over the Alden Valley to its south and Musbury Valley to the north. Our circular walk climbs to the summit from the nearby village of Helmshore. You can also pick up the waymarked Rossendale Way around here and visit the National Trust's expansive Holcombe Moor. Just to the east you can visit neighbouring Rawtenstall and enjoy a walk along the Irwell Sculpture Trail. There's also the excellent excellent Whitaker Museum and Art Gallery and the heritage East Lancs Railway to visit here. For more walking ideas in the county see the Lancashire Walks page."
