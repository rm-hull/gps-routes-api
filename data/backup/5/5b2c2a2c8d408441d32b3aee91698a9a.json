Start the walk from the car park on Cribden End Lane, just to the north east of Haslingden. From here you can follow footpaths up to the summit where you will find the structure. The steel artwork was constructed in 2007 and is visible for miles around, particularly at night when it becomes illuminated. It sits on Top o' Slate a former quarry which now makes an excellent viewpoint over the Rossendale Valley below.",
