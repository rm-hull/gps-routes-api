  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk to this pretty reservoir from the Leicestershire village of Saddington. The area is very attractive with lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. Keep your eyes peeled for Egret and Goosander as you make your way around the site. You may also see little sailboats as the reservoir is home to a sailing club which runs taster sessions for novices. Starting from the village you can follow the Leicestershire Round long distance trail to the reservoir. There's a nice country lane running along the water which you can follow back to Weir Road. This road has some lovely views across the countryside and will lead you back to the village. Here you can pay a visit to St Helen's Church which has sections dating from the 13th century. The Grand Union Canal runs past the village. You can pick this up to continue your walk. Follow it east and it will take you to the splendid Foxton Locks and country park. You can also use the Leicestershire Round to further explore the area.",

      "content": "A few miles to the north east there's Hallaton to explore. The village includes a particularly picturesque pond, a 13th century church and quaint thatched cottages. Hallaton is also the location for the famous annual bottle kicking contest which takes place on Easter Monday. The circular Kibworth Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the reservoir before heading to the lovely Foxton Locks. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks page."
