  "description": "This Somerset based town has some nice trails along the River Cale and a major national long distance footpath running through it. It is located near the borders of three counties and includes an attractive high street with some fine old buildings. Interestingly the town is officially twinned with Ankh-Morpork - the premier city state in author Terry Pratchett's fantasy Discworld novels. This walk from the town follows a section of the epic Monarch's Way to the neighbouring villages of South Cheriton and Charlton Horethorne. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it south to South Cheriton via Maltkiln Hill Farm. The route continues south west before finishing at Charlton Horethorne. It's an attractive village with a fine old church and a pretty village green. After exploring the village and enjoying a drink at the local pub you can retrace your steps back to Wincanton.",

Outside there's a lovely walled beer garden if the sun is shining. They serve freshly cooked British pub food with some classic dishes to enjoy. You can find them on South Street at postcode BA9 9DL for your sat navs."
