  "description": "This short walk in Clevedon follows the Poet's Walk footpath along the cliff tops to the west of the town. The walk is inspired by some of the poets and writers who have visited Clevedon. These include Coleridge in 1795 and Tennyson in 1834. It's also a local nature reserve and includes calcareous grassland, coastal scrub, woodland, with fine views over the Bristol Channel. The walk starts in a lovely spot at the pretty Marine Lake at Salthouse Bay. From here you can pick up the little path heading south west along the coast. It runs down to Wain's Hill where there is an univallate Iron Age Fort. The hillfort is defined by a steep, natural slope from the south and north with two ramparts to the east. You can follow footpaths round the hill to the noteworthy St Andrew's Church. Parts of the original 12th century church remain with 14th and 15th century additions also. It's located in a fine elevated spot overlooking the Bristol Channel, and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The walk can be extended by continuing south along the coast to Gullhouse Point or heading north into Clevedon. Here you can enjoy a walk along the attractive seafront and visit the Grade I listed pier, which dates from the 1860s. In the town you can pick up our Portishead to Clevedon Walk. The 5 mile walk includes pretty bays, nice beaches, sandstone cliffs and great views across the Severn Estuary into Wales. You could also explore the Gordano Valley on the Gordano Round or try the Portishead Nature Reserve Walk .",
