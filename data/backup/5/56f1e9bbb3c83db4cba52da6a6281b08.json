  "description": "This pretty Somerset based village is a great place from which to explore the nearby Polden Hills and Mendip Hills . The village is known as the birthplace of Clarks\u00a0shoes which started off 200 years ago. There's also the Grade I listed 14th century church and the pretty Merriman Park to explore in the village. This circular walk from Street takes you to the viewpoint at Walton Hill before visiting the neighbouring village of Walton. You'll also pass the National Trust's Ivy Thorn Hill part of the Polden Hills. Start the walk from Stone Hill and follow footpaths south to Teazle Wood. Just east of here you can visit Ivy Thorn Hill where there are some nice woodland trails. Head west from here and you will soon come to Walton Hill which rises to 80 metres (260\u00a0ft). Here you'll find a converted windmill with fine views over the surrounding countryside. The route then heads north to visit Walton village before turning east and returning to Street. This walk uses part of the Polden Way to explore the area. To extend your outing the 6 mile trail could be followed east to visit the distinctive Admiral Hood Monument and Combe Hill Wood near Compton Dundon.",
