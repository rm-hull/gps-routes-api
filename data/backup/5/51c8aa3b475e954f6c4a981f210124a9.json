  "description": "The pretty Norfolk Village of Thornham has some lovely trails to try along the beautiful north coast of the county. This walk follows a section of the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path to the nearby village of Brancaster and the Titchwell Nature Reserve. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the waymarked trail. It heads south east from the town, following country lanes and bridleways to Branchester. You can follow trails north to the lovely beach where there are some dunes and fine sea views. Other nice, surfaced footpaths take you around the reserve where there's lots of little lagoons with a variety of birds to see. Other features include reed beds, saltmarshes, a sandy beach and a small woodland area near the car park. Notable visitors include pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To contine your walking around Thornham, follow the coast path west to Holme-next-the-Sea where there's more nice beaches and dunes to explore. Just beyond there you will find the town of Hunstanton where there's a variety of attractions. Heading east will take you past the attractive Brancaster Staithe to Burnham Overy Staithe and the Holkham National Nature Reserve. The reserve is one of the highlights of the area with 9,600 acres of grazing marsh, woodland, salt marsh, sand dunes and foreshore making it England's largest Nature Reserve. Near here you can also visit Holkham Park, pick up the Walsingham Way at the medieval Walsingham Abbey or catch a boat to the Blakeney Point Nature Reserve with its colonies of seals.",
