It dates from 1225 when it was built by Ranulf, the sixth Earl of Chester, and contains one of the deepest castle wells in the country. It was seized by King Henry III in 1237 and used by him and later his son, King Edward I, as a base for their campaigns against the Welsh. The castle was finally destroyed at the end of the Civil War."

  "description": "This Cheshire village is in a great location for exploring the Shropshire Union Canal and the woodland and countryside of the Cheshire Plain. The village is also home to the Ice Cream Farm, the largest ice cream shop in the world! This route uses sections of the Bishop Bennet Way, the Shropshire Union Canal, the Eddisbury Way, the Midshires Way and the Sandstone Trail to create a long walk around the village. On the way you'll visit some of the highlights of the area including Beeston Castle, Peckforton Castle and the Peckforton Hills. The walk starts in the village and head north along the Tattenhall Road to link with the Shropshire Union Canal near the Tattenhall Marina. Follow the towpath east from Crow's Next Bridge to Dutton's Bridge and the River Gowy Aqueduct. Here you can pick up the Eddisbury Way and follow the waymarked footpath south to Wood Lane. The route then heads east to visit Peckforton Castle where you'll find a 19th century manor house now used as a hotel. From here you then head north to climb to Beeston Castle. The 13th century castle is a popular spot with an interesting history and fine views from its elevated position. At Beeston you head south west to pick up the Sandstone Trail and follow it to Higher Budwarsley where you turn west to Budwarsley. The route then returns to the village, mainly on the same paths with a section along the Bishop Bennet Way near the end.",
