From the sixteenth century until around 1900, goods handled at Porthclais included wool, corn, malt, timber and lime. The derelict lime kilns can still be seen on both sides of Porthclais harbour. Limestone was brought in by ship and burnt in the kilns to produce lime which was transported away by horse and cart; some went to make mortar but most was used for agricultural soil conditioning."

Porthclais harbour is at the head of a narrow inlet, a ria formed when seawater flooded the valley which had been carved out by retreating glaciation after the last ice age. A stone breakwater protects the harbour entrance. The coast around Porthclais is popular with canoeists and rock-climbers."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful coastline and fascinating geological features of the Treginnis Peninsula in the Pembrokeshire National Park. You will pass the oldest volcanic rocks in Wales, formed over 600 million years ago. It's a particularly beautiful stretch of coast with wonderful views over to the nearby Ramsey Island. It's also a great area for wildlife watching. Look out for birds including Peregrine, Oystercatcher, Kittiwake and Shag. You may also see porpoises in the water below and deer on Ramsey Island. The walk starts at the Porth Clais car park and follows country lanes towards Treginnis Lodge where there are super views towards Skomer Island and St Bride's Bay. Just past Treginnis Lodge you turn right off the country lane at the sign for Pencnwc Farm, and head north towards Porthstinian/St Justinian. At St Justinian you will pass the RNLI station, the Grade I listed ruined chapel and the small harbour where you can catch boats to Ramsey Island. At St Justinian you pick up the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and head south passing the Iron Age hillfort of Castell Heinif and Seal Bay where you can look out for seal pups in late summer and early autumn. You then head east along the coast passing Porthlysgi Bay with views of Skomer Island, Midland Isle and the Marloes Peninsula in the distance. Finally you pass around the pretty Porthclais Harbour before returning to the car park. It's a lovely area with wild horses and stunning coastal views while in the summer many of the coastal fields are covered with pretty heather.",
