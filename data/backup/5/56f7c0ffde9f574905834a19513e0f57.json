  "description": "This park is located in Camberley, Surrey, and comprises 145 acres of heathland habitat, woodland, shrubs and lowland bog. These habitats offer the opportunity to observe a wide variety of wildlife, birds, mammals, plants and insects. There are a number of fine walking trails in the park, an on site car park and an excellent visitor centre with a wealth of information. At the western side of the park there are also some nice hill climbs with excellent views towards London and Guildford. There is also an MOD vehicle testing track in this area so take care they are not testing when you walk in this area.",
