  "description": "This park is located in Camberley, Surrey, and comprises 145 acres of heathland habitat, woodland, shrubs and lowland bog. These habitats offer the opportunity to observe a wide variety of wildlife, birds, mammals, plants and insects. There are a number of fine walking trails in the park, an on site car park and an excellent visitor centre with a wealth of information. At the western side of the park there are also some nice hill climbs with excellent views towards London and Guildford. There is also an MOD vehicle testing track in this area so take care they are not testing when you walk in this area.",

      "content": "Just to the east of the park there's more nice trails around Windlesham Arboretum. There's peaceful woodland with follies, rare trees, a lake and lake house to see. You can find them a short walk from the park at postcode GU19 5PA. Lightwater Park is located near the Camberley Walk where you can visit Swinley Forest, Bracknell Forest and the Tri Lakes Country Park. There's miles of good woodland and waterside trails on this splendid route. Just to the north you could pick up the Bagshot Park Walk. This takes you past the noteworthy royal residence to the pretty Rapley Lake. The Grade II listed house has been country home of Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex since their 1999 wedding.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Surrey Walks page."
