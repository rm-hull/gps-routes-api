    "description": "Explore the Swinton Estate on this circular walk in North Yorkshire. The park covers 200 acres and includes miles of footpaths taking you to parkland, woodland, lakes and gardens. The castle is the seat of the Earl of Swinton and has now been converted into a hotel.  If you're a resident you can enjoy the parkland for no extra charge but if not you can still gain access for a fee (\u00a35 for adults at time of writing). Park highlights include the resident herd of fallow deer, views of the River Ure, heather moorland, the Walled Garden and the backdrop of some lovely Yorkshire Dales countryside. After your exercise head to The Bivouac cafe where you can sit outside on the nice patio and enjoy refreshments. To continue your walking in the area try our Masham Circular Walk or visit the fascinating Druids Temple . The site includes an early 19th century replica of Stonehenge surrounded by attractive woodland. Also on the wider estate are some nice waterside trails along Leighton Reservoir and Roundhill Reservoir just to the west of the park. Just to the north you can pick up the Ripon Rowel . The waymarked trail explores this area of the Nidderdale AONB.",
