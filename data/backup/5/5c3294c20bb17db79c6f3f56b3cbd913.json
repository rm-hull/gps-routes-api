  "description": "This quiet Derbyshire based village sits close to the border with Staffordshire and the River Dove. There's some nice trails to follow through the surrounding countryside with the Peak District and the Churnet Valley also nearby. This walk from the village takes you to some of the bridges on the River Dove just to the west of the settlement. You can start the walk on the eastern side of the village at Doveridge Manor House. Then follow footpaths west through the settlement towards the church and the causeway leading to the river. Here you'll find a footbridge which you can cross to visit the two bridges and pretty weir just to the north. You could extend the walk by picking up the Staffordshire Way and following it into nearby Uttoxeter .",
