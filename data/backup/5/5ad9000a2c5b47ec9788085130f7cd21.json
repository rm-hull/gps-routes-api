  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the southern end of this expansive reservoir in Northumberland. The route visits the Bullcrag Peninsula and the Kielder Dam with fine views across the water throughout. The impressive man made reservoir is notable as the largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom by capacity of water. The walk starts from the Tower Knowe Visitor Centre at the southern end of the lake. There's good facilities here with a car park, cafe and an interactive exhibition on the Dam and how it was built. There's a nice viewpoint here just to the north east of the centre which you can visit before starting the walk. Here you'll find a cairn representing the start of the project. The route heads west from the car park along the lakeside path to the Bull Crag Peninsula. There's nice trails here around the peninsula taking you to the Otterstone viewpoint. After rounding the peninsula you then retrace your steps to the visitor centre before heading east to visit the Kielder Dam.",
