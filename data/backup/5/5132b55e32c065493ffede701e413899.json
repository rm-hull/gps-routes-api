  "description": "This Warwickshire based market town has some nice river and country trails for walkers to try. The historic town centre is also a pleasant place for a stroll with a number of noteworthy old buildings. These include several old coaching houses and the 12th century Church of St Peter St Paul at the top of the Market Square. This circular walk from the town visits some of the local highlights including the Cole End nature reserve and the lovely Shustoke Reservoir. It also makes use of one of the local waymarked footpaths in the shape of the Heart of England Way. The walk starts in the town centre and follows country lanes north east out of the town. On this section you can follow a footpath north to visit the Cole End Park Nature Reserve. There's lots of interesting wildlife and plantlife to see on the site, which is located on the River Cole on the northern side of the town. You then continue east on the Blythe Road before following a public footpath through the countryside to Shustoke. Here you pass through the little village before following a circular trail around the picturesque lake. At the eastern end of the water you pick up the Heart of England Way and follow the trail south to Dover House Farm and Dumble Wood. Here you turn west to follow a trail past the Maxstoke golf course and the Pooltail woodland plantation before crossing the River Cole and returning to the town.",
