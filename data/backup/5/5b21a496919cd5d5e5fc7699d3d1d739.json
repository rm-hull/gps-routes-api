  "description": "This circular walk visits the 15th century Rosslyn Chapel in the village of Roslin in Midlothian. The walk also visits the nearby Roslin Castle and explores the woodland along the River North Esk. It's a lovely place for a stroll with the historic sites surrounded by an attractive woodland glen with river views. You start off from the car park and visitor centre at the chapel. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south past the ancient site. The striking chapel is considered an architectural masterpiece. It became world famous when it was featured in Dan Brown's the Da Vinci Code. Continue south from the chapel through the peaceful woodland and you will soon come to the castle ruins. The walk then follows footpaths east along the river before returning to the car park. To continue your walking in the area head south to further explore Roslin Glen Country Park. Here you can enjoy more fine trails taking you to Wallace's Cave and Hawthornden Castle.",
