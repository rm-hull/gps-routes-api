  "description": "Haxby is a town located in North Yorkshire just north of the city of York. The town is well served by walking trails with the Foss Walk, the Ebor Way and the York Millennium Way all passing the eastern side of the town. This circular walk makes use of these trails to explore the countryside to the east of the town. Along the way there's some nice riverside trails along the Foss and some fine rural scenery to enjoy. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Haxby. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
