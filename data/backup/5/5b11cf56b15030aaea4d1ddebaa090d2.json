  "description": "This circular walk explores the expansive Kershope Forest in Cumbria. The route runs for just over 11 miles with some climbs to the fells within the forest. The forest is located in a remote spot near Kershopefoot on the Scotland/England border. The walk starts from the forestry comission parking area near Cuddyshall Bridge where there's also a picnic area. From here you can pick up trails heading east towards the Black Lyne river which runs through the forest. You continue east to the Bewcastle Fells where you can follow a path north east up to Christianbury Crags. This interesting set of crags consists of small tors of hard sandstone. There are fine views over the area from this elevated position. You then retrace your steps before turning south to Ellery Grain, Shie Knowe and the remains of a Bastle at The Flatt. Here you can pick up some pleasant country lanes and follow them east to Crosshill and Holmhead where you cross the Black Lyne and pass a waterfall. The country lanes then bend round to the north and return you to the car park.",
