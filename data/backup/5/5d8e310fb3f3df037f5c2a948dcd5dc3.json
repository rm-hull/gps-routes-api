There's a nice circular footpath running around the lake for a distance of just under a mile. The site also includes some pleasant woodland and lots of water loving wildlife. You can start your walk from the car park at the south eastern end of the site, just off the Northwich Road. Shakerley Mere is located just a few miles from both Knutsford and Northwich. On the eastern side of the motorway there's some more trails around Rudheath Woods and Allostock.",
