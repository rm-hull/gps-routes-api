There's a nice footpath running round the lake with the option of extending your walk in the woodland of Mapperley Wood Nature Reserve, just to the east of the lake. The site has it's own good sized car park with an information board and picnic tables. From here you can pick up the trails heading round the lake and through the surrounding woodland. It's a nice easy walk with good views across the water and lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. You can extend your outing by exploring Shipley Park and picking up the Nutbrook Trail .",
