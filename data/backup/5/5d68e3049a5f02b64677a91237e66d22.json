  "description": "This magnificent 16th century mansion is surrounded by beautiful parkland and gardens, perfect for a peaceful walk. The house includes the 52 metre Long Gallery with a collection of Tudor portraits from the National Portrait Gallery. The parkland includes the Cedar Lawn with its wibbly wobbly hedges, the orangery with its pretty water cascade, and the lovely Lime Tree avenue with lovely views of the house. Montacute House is located just a couple of miles west of Yeovil Country Park . The Leland Trail runs past the house so you could pick this up if you wanted to continue your walk. Ham Hill Country Park is less than a mile west of Montacute so this is another good option. There's fabulous views over the surrounding countryside from the elevated position of the hill. Another nice option is to climb to the nearby St. Michael's Hill where there are fantastic views back down to the house and gardens.",
