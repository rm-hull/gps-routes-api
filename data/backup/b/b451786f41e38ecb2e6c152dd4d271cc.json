  "description": "This circular walk from Beaconsfield explores some lovely Chilterns countryside. You'll also visit the lovely Hodgemoor Woods and the interesting village of Chalfont St Giles. The 11 mile route uses a mixture of public footpaths, country lanes and a section of the South Bucks Way. The walk starts from the train station and heads north through the town to Brown's Wood near Knotty Green You then turn east to Owlsears Wood before coming to Hodgemoor. The 250 acre woods include lots of pretty bluebells in the spring and a healthy population of Muntjac Deer to look out for. Also keep your eyes peeled for tawny owls, buzzards, kites and numerous other woodland birds. After leaving the woods you come to Chalfont St Giles. The attractive village includes nice cottages with a duck pond fed by the River Misbourne. Other highlights include the church of Saint Giles which is of Norman architecture and dates from the 12th century. You can also visit the former home of John Milton, author of the epic poem 'Paradise Lost'. The house is now a open to the public as a museum and includes an extensive collection of 17th-century first editions of John Milton's works, both poetry and prose. There's a good selection of pubs and cafes so it makes an ideal stopping point for refreshments, at what is about the half way point of the walk. From the village you pick up the waymarked South Bucks Way long distance footpath. Follow it south and it takes you past Dibden Hill toward Chalfont St Peter. Here you turn west to follow paths through Jordans and Seer Green, where you pass the golf course before returning to Beaconsfield. To continue your walking around the Beaconsifield area you could pick up the Chiltern Way and the Chiltern Heritage Trail at Hodgemoor Woods. You could also visit the popular town of Amersham and try our Amersham Circular Walk .",
