  "description": "This walk takes you along a beautiful stretch of the Northumberland Coast Path from Craster to Dunstanburgh Castle and then on to Embleton Bay and the Newton Pool Nature Reserve. Dunstanburgh Castle was built in the 14th century, being one of the largest and grandest fortifications in Northern England at the time. The dramatic ruins are now a popular tourist attraction, standing on a remote headland with fine views of Embleton Bay and Craster. This walk starts at the small fishing village of Craster and follows the coastal path past the castle to Embleton Bay where you will find a lovely beach and sand dunes. You continue to the Newton Pool Nature Reserve where you can use the bird hides to look out for Herons and Barn Owls. The castle is located about 5 miles north east of Alnwick where you can continue your walking in the lovely Hulne Park or around Alnwick Castle and gardens. The extensive park has several waymarked trails  with woodland, riverside paths and wonderful views from the high points. The St Oswald's Way walking route runs past the castle so you could extend your walk along this footpath. Heading north with take you to Beadnell where you will find the lovely Beadnell Bay with its 2 mile long sandy beach. You can also try our Craster Circular Walk and visit the Arnold NWT Nature Reserve and the interesting cliff formations at Cullernose Point.",
