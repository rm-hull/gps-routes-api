The natural beauty of the area is complemented by its diverse flora and fauna. Wildflowers such as primroses, saxifrage, and meadowsweet thrive, while vibrant gorse bushes add a splash of yellow in spring, releasing a coconut-like scent. Lichens, including rare species, adorn the rocks. Exmoor ponies graze the hill, aiding in habitat maintenance, while birdlife includes peregrine falcons, skylarks, and barn owls. Mammals such as foxes and badgers are also present."

  "description": "This walk climbs to an ancient hill fort near Haddington in East Lothian. The site is notable for the discovery of the Traprain Law Treasure, the largest Roman silver hoard from anywhere outside the Roman Empire. From the 220 metre high summit you can enjoy some splendid views of the surrounding area. There's also some photogenic rock formations and Exmoor Ponies to see on the way. There is a car park next to the hill where you can start your walk. From here you can pick up a circular trail taking you up to the summit before passing the old quarry. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the Haddington to Longniddry Railway Walk and enjoy a walk or cycle along the old railway line.",
