  "description": "A lovely circular walk from the Lancashire village of Downham, visiting the countryside to the east of the village. The village is one of the prettiest in the county and has been used as a location in TV and film. There's great views of the nearby Pendle Hill from the country footpaths surrounding the village. It's also within the bounds of the Forest of Bowland AONB and the Ribble Valley where there are fine walking opportunities. This circular walk starts from the Downham Village Car Park where there's free parking and an information centre. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south east, passing close to the Downham Beck on the way. The walk then heads through farmland towards Twiston Mill, passing Twiston Beck on the way. The paths pass the old cotton mill heading north to Torrid Bank Wood before heading west to Wooly Hill before returning to Downham. On this last stretch you will pass Downham Mill which was in use up to the early 1900s. There is a pretty millpond and views of the Ings Beck in this area.",
