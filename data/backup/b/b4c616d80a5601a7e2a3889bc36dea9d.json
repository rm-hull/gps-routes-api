  "description": "This walk visits the grounds of Ettington Park Hotel in the Warwickshire village of Ettington. The Grade I listed Victorian mansion is surrounded by 40 acres of lovely parkland with well laid out gardens, an Orangery and a Norman Chapel. You can enjoy an afternoon tea at the hotel and then explore the grounds or pick up a public bridleway running along the eastern side of the park. From here there are nice views over the parkland and the surrounding countryside. Follow the bridleway south east along Shakespeare's Way and it will take you across the park to the nearby village of Halford. Here you can enjoy some nice views over the River Stour which runs past the park. To continue your walking in the area head to Compton Verney. Here you can explore the Capability Brown landscaped grounds surrounding an historic Georgian Mansion. Near here there's also the National Trust's Charlecote Park with its beautiful lake and deer park.",
