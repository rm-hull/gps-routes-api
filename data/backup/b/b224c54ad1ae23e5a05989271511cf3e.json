            "caption": "West Acre, Norfolk - Village sign & Priory Gateway. The gateway to the 13th-century Priory sits immediately to the west of All Saints Church. The church itself is rather striking, being essentially Perpendicular in style, which is a phase of Gothic architecture that emphasises vertical lines and large windows. Sir Edward Barkham substantially rebuilt the church in the 17th century, and his death head symbol is placed above the entrance to the porch, adding a unique historical touch. This porch contains a 13th-century relief sculpture, showcasing the church's long history and artistic heritage. The clock on the tower serves as a poignant reminder to \"Watch and Pray,\" reflecting the spiritual focus of the church.\nAll Saints is one of seven churches that belong to the Nar Valley Group, a collection of parishes ministered by Canon Stuart Nairn. This grouping allows the communities to share resources and clergy, fostering a sense of unity and collaboration among the local churches."
