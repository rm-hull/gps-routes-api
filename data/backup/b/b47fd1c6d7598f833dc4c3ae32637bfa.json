  "description": "This walk visits the historic Force Crag Mine from the Cumbrian village of Braithwaite. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up footpaths heading south west along the Coledale Beck for a distance of about 2.5 miles. These will lead you to the old mines which sit just to the south of Grisedale Pike . The Scheduled ancient monument dates back to the 1800s and is now run by the National Trust. See the link below for details of open days when you can explore the buildings. It's an atmospheric and isolated spot with some fine views of the surrounding Lake District hills. There are also information boards where you can learn about the lead mining history, the restoration and water treatment in the area. The mines lie very close to the Coledale Horseshoe. The longer circular route explores the wonderful Coledale Valley, climbing to several of the significant local peaks. It's a nice way to extend your walk if you have time. other mines?",
