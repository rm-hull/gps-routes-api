  "description": "This coastal walk follows a lovely section of the from Perranporth to St Agnes Head in Cornwall. The route runs for just over 5 miles but you have the option of getting the bus back if you prefer. You can reach St Agnes village by following a footpath south from Trevaunance Cove. The walk starts in Perranporth and follows the waymarked footpath west to the wonderful cliffs at Droskyn Point and Cligga Head. You continue past the Blue Hills before coming to the picturesque Trevaunance Cove where there's a nice beach. The last section takes you past Newdowns Head before coming to St Agnes Head. You can extend the walk by heading south east from the headland to climb to St Agnes Beacon. There's more great views from this hill which stands at a heigh of 192 metres above the bay. There's also the ruins of the old Wheal Coates tin mine nearby. This dramatic area is area is known as Poldark country due to its literary associations. The walk can easily be extended by continuing south to vist the lovely beaches as Chapel Porth and Porthtowan .",
