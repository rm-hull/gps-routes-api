Then follow trails south west past Badiebath Woods to the castle site. There are some substantial ruins to explore here with the surrounding countryside making a pleasant backdrop. The castle is also notable as the ancestral home of romantic poet Lord Byron. Around here there are also some nice trails along the Ythan River and the Braes of Gight to the south of the castle.",
