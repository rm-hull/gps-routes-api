  "description": "This short walk takes you to this lovely waterfall in the Ingram Valley. The walk starts at Hartside where there is parking available by the roadside. You then follow a country lane to Linhope where you cross the River Breamish and ascend to the waterfall and Linhope burn on public footpaths. The waterfall is an impressive 60 foot (18m) chute of water landing into a deep plunge pool below. On the walk there are splendid views of Great Standrop and Hedgehope Hill. Look out for Curlew and red squirrels on the way. Our Ingram Valley and River Breamish Valley circular walks both pass close to the falls. For a longer walk you could start from the Ingram Bridge car park and follow either of these trails to Linhope. Back in Ingram there's the option of visiting the nice Ingram Cafe where there's a good range of meals and snacks to enjoy after your exercise. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb the nearby Hedgehope Hill and The Cheviot .",
