  "description": "This very popular trail explores the wonderfully artwork created on vacant walls in Glasgow's city centre. Many of the murals are large, wonderful creations covering an entire side of a building. It's an impressive sight and a must do attraction for lovers of art and walking. The circular route runs for a distance of about 4.5 miles so should take a little under 2 hours to complete. Highlights include a series of murals of \u00a0Billy Connolly who is from the city. These can be found in the Trongate  area. Also look out for the 'World's Most Economical Taxi' by Rogue-One. This shows a black cab floating away on a number of balloons. See the video below from Glasgow Council for full details of the murals. The walk starts from the cathedral next to the River Kelvin in the city centre. You then head west along the river, before turning north to Central Station. You continue west through Anderston before heading up to Charing Cross Station and Garnethill. From here you head east past Queen Street Station and the City Chambers. The route then passes High Street Station before returning to the cathedral. To continue your walking in the city try the Kelvin Walkway which takes you along the river on a good, waymarked footpath. There's also the Glasgow Canal Walk which takes you along the towpath of the Forth and Clyde Canal . The Clyde Walkway is another great waterside option in the city centre. This will take you to Strathclyde Loch Country Park , Chatelherault Country Park and the photogenic ruins of the historic 13th century Bothwell Castle .",
