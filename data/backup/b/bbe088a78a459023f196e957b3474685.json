It is a sandstone 21-arch bridge spanning the Wharfe valley, engineered by James Bray for the Leeds and Thirsk Railway circa 1850. The structure of the viaduct is unelaborate but its simple geometry is breathtakingly beautiful. It is unusual in that it is built along a curved path."

  "description": "This walk visits the Arthington Viaduct or Wharfedale Viaduct near Leeds in North Yorkshire. The photogenic Grade II listed structure was built in 1845 and is (460 m) in length, with 21 semi-circular arches on high piers. You can park at the end of Warren Lane which runs up to the viaduct on the south side of the river. Around here there's some grassy footpaths running along the River Wharfe with great views over the surrounding Wharfedale countryside. For a longer walk you could start of at nearby Bramhope and follow Warren Lane north through the countryside to the site. You can extend the walk by heading south to pick up the Dales Way Link and following it east to visit Harewood House and Eccup Reservoir. To the north you could climb to Almscliffe Crag for some wonderful views to the viaduct. other viaduc",
