  "description": "This walk visits Warley Moor Reservoir near Ovenden Moor, Halifax. Start the walk from the Ogden Water car park which is located a couple of miles east of the reservoir. From here you can pick up a bridleway heading west across Mixenden Ings and Round Hill to Cold Edge. Here you pick up a country lane heading north to Warley Moor. It's a very peaceful place with nice views across the moors and sailboats on the water. You'll also pass the Ovenden Moor Wind Farm an expansive site that can be seen from some distance over Bronte Country.",
