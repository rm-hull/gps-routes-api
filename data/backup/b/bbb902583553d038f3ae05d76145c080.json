  "description": "Explores 214 hectares of parkland and woodland in Avondale Forest Park near Rathdrum in County Wicklow. The expansive park is a walkers paradise with miles of waymarked trails to try. This circular walk takes you along the Avonmore River which runs along the eastern side of the site. The route runs for a distance of just over 5km on fairly flat footpaths. You can start the walk from the car park at Avondale House. The historic house dates back to the 18th century and was the home of Charles Stewart Parnell an Irish nationalist politician who served as Leader of the Home Rule League from 1880 to 1882. From the car park follow the trails north east to the river where you can pick up a nice riverside path heading south. The route then returns via a series of peaceful woodland trails where you admire the magnificant Giant Redwoods and look out for a variety of wildlife. The site also includes a popular treetop walk where you can enjoy wonderful views over the area from an elevated path through the trees. It is the first of its kind in Ireland. You can visit the site by car from Dublin in about 1-1.5 hours. The village of Rathrdum is located about 2km from the park and is accessible by train from Dublin.",

There's also the more challenging climbs to the viewpoints at Lugnaquilla and Turlough Hill. To the south west there's the popular Tinahely Railway Walk along the old railway line around the pretty village of Tinahely. Also nearby is the beautiful heart shaped lake of Lough Ouler. In this area you can also visit the Glenmacnass waterfall and enjoy a climb to the stunning viewpoint at Tonelagee."
