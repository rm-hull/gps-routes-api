  "description": "This town in Rhondda Cynon Taf\u00a0has some nice walking trails along the River Taff and through the countryside of the Rhymney Valley. This route uses sections of the Taff Trail and the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk to create a circular walk around the town. The walk starts on the Pontypridd Old Bridge in the town centre. It's a structure of some note having been built by William Edwards\u00a0in 1756. The arched single span footbridge is a scheduled ancient monument\u00a0and Grade I listed. Just south of the bridge you can enjoy a stroll around Ynysangharad War Memorial Park where there are some nice trails around the site where the\u00a0River Rhondda\u00a0meets the\u00a0River Taff. The opening section also passes Pontypridd Common where you can see the The Rocking Stone - a glacial boulder remaining from the Ice Age. From here you can pick up the Taff Trail and follow it south east towards Glyntaff and Rhydyfellin. At Upper Boat you leave the trail to climb to Groes-wen where you meet with the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk. Follow the trail north west and it will take you past Hendredenny Park before climbing to Mynydd Meio which stands at a height of 322\u00a0m (1,056\u00a0ft). From here you can enjoy wonderful views over the Taff Valley. The route then descends to Pentrebach before returning to the town centre.",
