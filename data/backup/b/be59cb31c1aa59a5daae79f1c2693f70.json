  "description": "This walk visits a pretty nature reserve in Abbots Leigh in North Somerset. The walk starts in the village of Abbots Leigh, just west of Bristol and the Avon Gorge. You could also use the small free car park off Manor Road if you prefer. From the village you can then follow footpaths a short distance to the south west to reach the nature reserve. Here you'll find a number of woodland trails running around the pool at the centre. The area has some history having been part of a series of pools used by medieval monks for the practice of farming for fish. The site is also good for flora and fauna with wild flowers, ferns and rhododendrons to see on your visit.",
