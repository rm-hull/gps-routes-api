  "description": "This walk visits a pretty nature reserve in Abbots Leigh in North Somerset. The walk starts in the village of Abbots Leigh, just west of Bristol and the Avon Gorge. You could also use the small free car park off Manor Road if you prefer. From the village you can then follow footpaths a short distance to the south west to reach the nature reserve. Here you'll find a number of woodland trails running around the pool at the centre. The area has some history having been part of a series of pools used by medieval monks for the practice of farming for fish. The site is also good for flora and fauna with wild flowers, ferns and rhododendrons to see on your visit.",

Inside there are cosy fires for the winter months. They have a great menu and can be found on Manor Road at postcode BS8 3RP for your sat navs."

      "content": "The woodland trails make for a fine dog walk so you'll probably see other owners on your visit. Please note dogs are not allowed in the main pool. There is a smaller pool and some streams for them to go for a dip though. The George mentioned above is also dog friendly."

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "Head east into the Avon Gorge and you can pick up more woodland trails in Leigh Woods. You could also pick up the River Avon Trail and visit the iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge. There's also some fine trails on The Downs on the eastern side of the river. The circular Failand Walk starts from the nearby village and visits the pool. It also passes close to the splendid Ashton Court Park and Tyntesfield House which are well worth a visit. The Gordano Round passes the pool. This waymarked circular walk explores some of the walking highlights of the area including the Severn Estuary around Portishead. A few miles to the south west you will find the circular walk around the Barrow Gurney Reservoirs. The reservoirs are an excellent place for a peaceful stroll with lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks page."
