  "description": "This walk explores the countryside surrounding the village of Alkham in Kent. The valley lies between Folkestone and Dover in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It's a fine place for a walk with hill climbs, woodland and outstanding views from the high points. This figure of eight loop walk starts in Alkham village and follows public footpaths through the surrounding valley. On the way you will visit two significant local historical sites including St Radigund's Abbey and St Peter's Church in Swingfield. Starting in the village you first head south east to visit St. Radegund's Abbey. The Grade II listed ruins have now been incorporated into a farm and include an impressive ancient gatehouse. The route then returns to the village on alternative paths before heading up through the valley to Swingfield where you can visit St Peter's Church. The church is Grade I listed and dates back to the 11th century. A huge thirteenth-century tower and a  fourteenth-century porch with two medieval 'Mass Dials' are two of the main features of this noteworthy medieval site. To continue your walking in the valley head east to visit Kearsney Abbey . There's some beautiful gardens here with ornamental lakes and views of the River Dour",
