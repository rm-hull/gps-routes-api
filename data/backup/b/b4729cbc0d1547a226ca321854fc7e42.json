  "description": "This village is located in East Riding of Yorkshire on the edge of the Yorkshire Wolds near Hull. This circular walk from the town explores the countryside to the north, visiting Skidby Mill and Risby Park on the way. The walk starts in the town and heads north through Cottingham Parks to Hall Ings and Beverley Parks. Here you pick up a section of the Beverley Twenty and follow the waymarked trail west to Low Daw Hill. Turn south and the trail takes you along the edge of Risby Park where there's lakes, old follies, woodland and the ruins of Risby Hall to see. You can take a detour west to explore this area. This route continues south along the Beverley Twenty to Skidby village where you can visit the historic Skidby Mill. The Grade II listed mill dates back to 1821 and is a popular local attraction. Inside there's an interesting museum where you can learn all about the history of the area. The route then follows country lanes and roads south east to return to Cottingham.",
