  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the West Sussex coast from Bracklesham Bay to the Medmerry RSPB Nature Reserve. It's a nice stretch of coast with some good wildlife spotting opportunities as well. You can start the walk from the car park on the sea front between East Wittering and Bracklesham. The coastal path then heads south east along the bay to RSPB Medmerry with views over the pebble beach to the Isle of Wight. You can then follow a path leading north away from the coast about a mile from Bracklesham. This will take you into the reserve where you can follow footpaths around the site. There's a wide range of habitats to explore such as intertidal mudflats, grassland, farmland saltmarsh and lagoons. Look out for birds such as Lapwing, Skylark and Avocet from the bird hides dotted along the walk. After exploring the reserve the walk returns to Bracklesham on the same paths. You can continue your walking in the area by heading west from the car park to West Wittering and East Head where there's more lovely trails and beaches. Also nearby is Pagham Harbour where there's lots more wildlife to see in the reserve.",
