  "description": "This rural Warwickshire village is located near Leamington Spa and Banbury in the Stratford-on-Avon District of the county. The area is known for some interesting history and the British Motor Museum which lies just to the north.

This walk from the village follows a section of the Warwickshire Centenary Way to one of the local highlights at the nearby Burton Dassett Hills Country Park. You can pick up the long distance trail just to the east of the settlement. Follow the waymarked path south east along a quiet country lane and it will soon lead you to the popular country park. Here you can climb a series of hills while enjoying some glorious views over the surrounding countryside and villages. To continue your walking in the area head a little further east to pick up a nice easy waterside walk along the Oxford Canal Walk. Scroll down for the full list of walks near Gaydon.",
