  "description": "This walk visits the Tobermory Lighthouse on the Isle of Mull. Tobermory is a lovely place and considered one of the prettiest villages in Scotland. The historic settlement dates back to the 18th century and is noted for its picturesque harbour and brightly painted buildings along the main street. The walk starts in the village and follows a footpath north along the coast for just under 1.5 miles. Good footwear is required as the path can be quite muddy. The Rubha nan Gall lighthouse dates back to the mid 19th century and overlooks the Sound of Mull.\u00a0There's fine views across the water as you make your way along the path. See the video below to see the fine views over the water you will enjoy from the elevated path. To continue your walking in the area head south to pick up the pleasant waterside trails along Loch Frisa . Here you can look out for wildlife including ponies, hen harriers and white tailed eagles.",
