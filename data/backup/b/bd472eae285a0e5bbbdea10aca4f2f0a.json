  "description": "Explore the stunning gardens surrounding this spectacular Jacobean mansion in Saffron Walden, Essex. Visit the beautifully restored parterre with its striking bedding scheme and beautiful fountain. The walled kitchen garden is run entirely on organic principles and contains glasshouses, a vinery and 150 varieties of apples, 40 varieties of pears plus other assorted plums and cherries. There is also a delightful Victorian pond garden with a rockery and the Elysian Garden where you will find the exquisite Tea House Bridge over the river Cam. The house was owned by Thomas Audley, Lord Chancellor to Henry VIII in the mid 16th century. You can visit the great hall, the saloon with wonderful furnishings, the library and the chapel built in an 18th-century ornamented Gothic style. There is also a stable yard where you can meet the resident horses and talk to the grooms about life at Audley End during Victorian times. The Harcamlow Way long distance footpath runs past Audley End so you could pick up this trail if you wanted to continue your walk. The house and gardens are located about 1 mile west of Saffron Walden.",

You could also head east into Saffron Walden where there's lots of good cafes and pubs to choose from. One good option is the Old English Gentleman. The noteworthy pub dates from the 19th century and was named CAMRA Regional Pub of the Year 2012. There's a charming interior with a cosy fire and wood burner. Outside there's a sun trap patio garden for warmer days. You can find them on Gold Street with a postcode of CB10 1EJ for your sat navs"

      "content": "If you follow the Harcamlow way south from the park you could pay a visit to the worthy town of Thaxted. Here you'll find a number of historic half timbered houses, a 14th century Guildhall, 16th century almshouses and a picturesque windmill. Following the trail south west will take you to Clavering where there's a noteworthy 14th century church and some delightful almshouses dating back to the 15th century. You'll also pass picturesque Arkesden which is well worth exploring. Just to the south of Saffron Walden there's the worthy village of Newport to explore. There's several photogenic Tudor buildings to admire in this historic settlement. You can also enjoy a walk to nearby Debden where there's a pretty lake and waterfall to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Essex Walks page."
