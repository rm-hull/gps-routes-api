  "description": "Explore the stunning gardens surrounding this spectacular Jacobean mansion in Saffron Walden, Essex. Visit the beautifully restored parterre with its striking bedding scheme and beautiful fountain. The walled kitchen garden is run entirely on organic principles and contains glasshouses, a vinery and 150 varieties of apples, 40 varieties of pears plus other assorted plums and cherries. There is also a delightful Victorian pond garden with a rockery and the Elysian Garden where you will find the exquisite Tea House Bridge over the river Cam. The house was owned by Thomas Audley, Lord Chancellor to Henry VIII in the mid 16th century. You can visit the great hall, the saloon with wonderful furnishings, the library and the chapel built in an 18th-century ornamented Gothic style. There is also a stable yard where you can meet the resident horses and talk to the grooms about life at Audley End during Victorian times. The Harcamlow Way long distance footpath runs past Audley End so you could pick up this trail if you wanted to continue your walk. The house and gardens are located about 1 mile west of Saffron Walden.",
