The dam is of hollow concrete buttress construction which was quite innovative in its day. The method was cheaper and lower maintenance. Any movement of the dam is monitored inside by a giant plumb bob which has only deflected one twentieth of an inch since the dam's construction."

  "description": "Follow the lakeside trail around the beautiful Haweswater Reservoir on this circular walk in the Lake District. The area is one of the quieter parts of the national park so you can expect a delightfully peaceful walk on good paths. The path runs around the lake for just over 10 miles with some woodland sections along the way. You can start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the lake. Then head along the western side on a good footpath with great views across the water to the surrounding fells. Along the way you will pass pockets of woodland, Measand Beck and The Forces waterfalls. Here you can take a detour and climb along the beck to Bampton Common. The route continues along the lakeside to the Haweswater Dam and Burnbanks where you will pass the RSPB Haweswater Nature Reserve. Look out for birds including Buzzard, Peregrine and Redstart in this area. At Naddle Bridge you cross the Haweswater Beck and start the return leg on the eastern side of the water. You'll pass Naddle Forest, Guerness Wood and Mardale Banks before returning to the car park. The northern tip of the Kentmere Horseshoe circular walk passes close to the lake at Harter Fell. If you climb up to Harter Fell from the parking area you can pick up the trail which takes you on a tour of the range of fells in the upper Kentmere valley. Just to the west you can visit Blea Water, Brothers Water and Hayeswater. Wainwright's Coast to Coast long distance route also passes the reservoir so you can pick this up to extend your walk. The climb to High Street also starts from the Mardale Head car park. You can virtually explore the eastern side of the reservoir using the google street view link below. Cyclists can enjoy a ride along this side of the water on the quiet country lane.",

      "content": "The Haweswater Hotel is perched right on the eastern side of the lake. There's a lovely outdoor terrace with wonderful views over the lake, towards Kidsty Pike. It's the perfect place to relax on a warm day. As an additional attraction the hotel has some pretty gardens to explore. There's mature trees and shrubs, including rhododendrons, maples and azaleas, interspersed with rock gardens, heather and alpine plantings. You may also see some of the tame red squirrels. The Crown and Mitre is a historic pub of some note. Located in nearby Bampton Grange, you will find this free house nestled in a wonderful location on the edge of the North Eastern Fells. It's a popular stopping point on the c2c walk and also provides accommodation. You can find it a couple of miles north of the lake at postcode CA10 2QR. There's also some nice riverside footpaths in the village if you fancy stretching your legs further."

      "content": "A few miles east of the lake you will find the historic ruins of Shap Abbey. If you have time the abbey and its associated park make for an excellent extension to your outing. There's nice footpaths along the River Lowther with the 12th century abbey ruins making a splendid backdrop. You could then head to the historic Greyhound Hotel in Shap village for some refreshments. The pub is another popular stopping point for people doing the coast 2 coast walk. It's set in a 17 century stone house and does very good food. It also has a series of picnic tables outside for warmer days. You can find the pub on Main St in Shap with a postcode of CA10 3PW for your sat navs. The pleasant waterside trails along Wet Sleddale Reservoir are also located in this area."
