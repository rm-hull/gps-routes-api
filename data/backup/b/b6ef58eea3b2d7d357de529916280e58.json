  "description": "Enjoy a walk along this beautiful reservoir in the Cambrian Mountains. It's a very peaceful place with fine views across the water to the surrounding hills and mountains. The reservoir dates from 1964 and forms part of the Cwm Rheidol hydroelectric power scheme. The headwaters of the reservoir include the source of the River Rheidol. You can start the walk from the car park next to the dam on the southern side of the water. From here you can pick up a quiet lane running west along the lake. You can follow this round to the northern side of the water where there are some hill climbs with fine views back down to the reservoir. These paths can also take you past Drosgol hill. The reservoir is located just to the north of Nant Y Arian . The expansive forest has miles of good footpaths and mountain bike trails to try. The highest point in the Cambrian Mountains is located just east of the reservoir at Plynlimon . It's a challenging climb but with the reward of more fine views of the area. Devil's Bridge Falls is also not far away. The spectacular falls include the imposing Jacob's Ladder stone steps and some wonderful scenery."
