  "description": "This circular walk visits the beautiful Catrigg Force waterfall in the Yorkshire Dales. It's a wonderful spot and can be easily reached from Stainforth. This longer walk starts at Settle and involves some more challenging hill climbing. After leaving Settle you climb towards Attimire Scar where you can see a series of caves and interesting limestone formations. You then descend to the waterfall, passing Jubilee Cave, Victoria Cave and Winskill Stones - a 74-acre area of limestone grassland and limestone pavement. The area is also a nature reserve with a wide variety of plants and wildflowers, such as sandwort, horseshoe vetch, meadow saxifrage, mossy saxifrage, mountain everlasting and moonwort. Shortly after passing through Wainskill Stones you come to Catrigg Force. The waterfall has 2 main drops of about 20 feet and a series of smaller waterfalls. It's a delightful area, with peaceful woodland and the Stainforth Beck to enjoy. The route then continues to Stainforth before picking up the Ribble Way and following the River Ribble back to Settle. This lovely waterside section also passes the Stainforth Force Waterfall. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Malham Tarn Estate or continue along the Ribble Way. The beautiful Scaleber Force waterfall is also only a two mile walk from Settle. Our Settle Caves and Waterfalls Walk visits both falls and the series of mysterious caves to the east of the town. The falls can be easily reached from the nearby village of Stainforth where you can also visit the lovely Stainforth Force waterfalls on the Settle Riverside Walk .",
