    "description": "Explore the beautiful lansdscaped gardens of Cannon Hall in Cawthorne, Yorkshire. The park includes sweeping grasslands, woodlands, a stream and a lake with a waterfall nearby. The hall itself is also worth a visit, housing collections of fine furniture, paintings, ceramics and glassware. The park is located on the Barnsley Boundary Walk and Penistone Boundary Walk so there is scope for continuing your walk along these walking paths. You could also head north west and try the woodland trails through Deffer Wood where there's lots of bluebells in the spring. At the northern edge of the wood you can pick up our Denby Dale Circular Walk which visits the River Dearne. Cannon Hall is located just a few miles west of Barnsley.",
