  "description": "Enjoy riverside walking, beautiful waterfalls and peaceful woodland trails on this walk through Glen Quoich in the Cairngorms. The walk starts at the Linn of Quoich parking area and follows Quoich Water to the waterfalls which were popular with Queen Victoria. On the walk you will pass an old building which was Queen Victoria's tearoom. The river is surrounded by attractive Scots pines and there is the wonderful backdrop of the Cairngorm Mountains to enjoy. You will also pass the Punch Bowl, a round carved hole that has formed over the centuries by the pounding water. You can continue your walking in the area by heading to the Linn of Dee which is only a few miles along the road to the west.",
