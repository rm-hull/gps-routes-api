  "description": "Enjoy waterside walks alongside a number of pretty lakes and the River Lark in this splendid country park near Bury St Edmunds. The park contains a number of nature trails through heathland and woodland and the fascinating West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village. There is also a wildfowl reserve with a number of bird hides. The park is located a few miles north west of Bury St Edmunds. It is situated on the Lark Valley Path so you could continue your walk along the river if you have time. Following it north west will take you to Icklingham where you will find the pretty Cavenham Heath Nature Reserve. Right next to the park you will find the King's Forest. This large area of woodland has miles of cycling and walking trails with Fallow, Red, Roe and Muntjac deer to look out for. It's located just to the north of the park. On the southern side there's Lackford Lakes where there's a free car park, cafe and visitor centre. Birds visiting the lakes include kingfisher, great crested grebe and tufted duck.",
