  "description": "Enjoy a walk along Glen Finglas Reservoir and Finglas Water on this lovely walk in the Trossachs. The glen consists of miles of attractive woodland trails, open heathland, rushing streams, waterfalls and challenging hill climbs. There's lots of wildlife to look out for including red deer, golden eagles and black grouse. You can park at the Glen Finglas car park to start your walk. From here you can pick up the waymarked trail to the reservoir. It follows the River Turk north before heading along the eastern side of the lake to Finglas Water. To extend your walk you can climb further into Glen Meann on the Mell trail. The circular trail runs for 15 miles and is suitable for mountain bikes and walkers. The cycling and walking trail along Loch Venachar and Loch Drunkie is also just to the south of the Glen. If you head west then you can visit Loch Achray and Loch Katrine .",
