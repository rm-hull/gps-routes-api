  "description": "This Lancashire based town is located in the Rossendale Valley area of the South Pennines. The historic town has an interesting industrial past with many old buildings surviving today. In fact, English Heritage has classified Bacup town centre as a protected area for its special architectural qualities. This walk from the town follows a section of the Irwell Sculpture Trail west to visit neighbouring Rawtenstall. The popular waymarked trail explores the valley of the River Irwell with some pleasant waterside sections and old mills to see. The route runs for just over 4 miles on a steadily descending footpath. At the end of the walk you can catch the bus back if you prefer. On the way you will pass close to Stubbylee Park which lies just to the south of the town. The public park has some nice footpaths, a play area, outdoor gym, bowling greens, tennis courts and a newly opened off road cycling \u2018pump track\u2019. You can continue your exercise around the town by heading south to visit Lee Quarry. The quarry includes a popular mountain bike trail and footpaths with some fabulous views from the elevated position of the site.",
