  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around these reservoirs located near Sheffield on the edge of the Peak District. You can start from the car park at the north western corner of the upper reservoir. The trails then take you around the middle and lower reservoir with some climbs into the surrounding moors. From the high points there are fabulous views back down to the reservoirs. There is also a woodland section through the Redmires Plantation towards the end of the route. Look out for a wide variety of wildfowl and waders on the water. To extend your walking in the area you could visit the nearby Rivelin Dams and pick up the splendid Rivelin Valley Nature Trail. Also nearby is the delightful Wyming Brook Nature Reserve. This is located near the Redmires Plantation and includes a nice walking trail along the Wyming Brook. Just to the west is Stanedge Pole and Stanage Edge. You can take a detour at the southern end of the upper reservoir to climb to Stanedge Pole. The pole stands at a height of 438 metres (1,437 feet) and marks the border between Derbyshire and South Yorkshire. If you continue your climb you will come to the stunning gritstone escarpment of Stanage Edge and the peak of High Neb. From here you can enjoy wonderful views over the Hallam Moors and the Hope Valley. This route is designed for walkers but cyclists can also enjoy the sections along the quiet Redmires Road which give great views over the water. You can virtually explore this area on the google street view link below.",

If you head west across Hallam Moors you will come to the Edge where there are interesting rock formations and wonderful views over the area. The circular walk from Lodge Moor visits the reservoir from the car park just to the east. The route then goes on to visit Rivelin Dams and the Wyming Brook."
