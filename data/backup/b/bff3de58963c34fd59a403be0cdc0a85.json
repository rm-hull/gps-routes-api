  "description": "This pretty Oxfordshire village is located in a fine position close to the Cotswold Hills. It includes a well known local brewery, a Norman church and some fine old Cotswolds pubs. This circular walk from the village explores the countryside to the west. You'll visit the neighbouring villages of Ascott, Whichford Wood , Long Compton and Great Rollright where you find the interesting Rollright Stones . The walk starts in the village and follows country lanes north and then west to meet up with the Macmillan Way long distance footpath. You then turn south to Ascott before turning west to enter Whichford Wood. The area consists of Broadleaved and conifer woodland with pretty bluebells to see during the spring months. The waymarked trail continues west along the fringe of the woods before turning south into Long Compton. The pretty village includes a fine old church, lych gate and village pond. After leaving the village you head south west before leaving the Macmillan Way to visit the Rollright Stones. Here you'll find a group of Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monuments consisting of three groups: the King's Men stone circle, the Whispering Knights burial chamber and the single King Stone. The route then heads east through the village of Great Rollright before returning to Hook Norton. You can extend the walk by heading south east from the village and visiting the remains of the Hook Norton Viaduct.",
