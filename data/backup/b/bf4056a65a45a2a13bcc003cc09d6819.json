  "description": "Explore Eaves Wood and enjoy a climb to the Pepperpot on this walk in the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. There's nice footpaths taking you through shady ancient woodland with limestone pavement supporting rare plants and wildlife. The walk starts from the parking area on Park Road, just south of the woods. Follow the trail north to enter the woods where you can pick up the woodland trails heading west. The trails take you up to King William's Hill where you will find the Pepperpot monument. The unusual structure was built in 1887 to commemorate the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria. From the viewpoint there are splendid views over the coast to Grange over Sands. The woods are located just to the south of Arnside Knott. To extend your walk you could follow footpaths north across Middlebarrow Plain to the nearby viewpoint. Just to the south east you will find Leighton Moss Nature Reserve. There's nice paths taking you around several lakes and lagoons, with a large variety of birdlife to look out for. Our Silverdale Circular Walk passes through the woods. You could pick this up and visit the beach and village.",

      "content": "In Arnside the The Albion is a good choice with lovely views across the Kent Estuary from the waterfront pub. There's a nice outdoor seating area where you can sit and take in views of Lakeland hills. You may also catch the Arnside Bore if you are there at the right time. The bore occurs at high tides, especially spring tides, where the incoming tide of Morecambe Bay narrows into the river estuary. You can find the pub at 36 The Promenade with a postcode of LA5 0HA for your sat navs."

      "content": "Just to the east is the Gait Barrows National Nature Reserve where you can enjoy a walk around Hawes Water and see more splendid limestone pavement.Near Arnside Knott you will find the atmospheric ruins of Arnside Tower. The late-medieval tower house (or Pele tower) was built in the second half of the 15th century. It's a Scheduled Monument and Grade II* listed building and makes for a striking photo. In Arnside you will also find the delightful Ashmeadow Woodlands. There's some lovely footpaths here with lots of birdlife to enjoy. The woods can be accessed from the end of the Promenade or walk along the first bit of the coast path and access the woodland from the opening near the coastguard station. If you head to the nearby Silverdale train station you could catch a train over the Kent viaduct to Grange Over Sands on the other side of the river. Here you can pick up the popular Grange-over-Sands and Cartmel Circular Walk which visits the fascinating 12th century Cartmel Priory and the splendidly positioned Hampsfell Hospice. A few miles to the north there's another local geological highlight at Beetham's Fairy Steps. Here you will find an unusual natural limestone staircase which you can climb for more excellent views. The little village of Beetham is also well worth exploring with its 14th century ruined manor house and a particularly lovely garden centre. Near here there's also the market town of Milnthorpe. Here you can enjoy a lovely walk along Milnthorpe Sands to the River Kent Estuary and the wonderful topiary at Levens Hall."
