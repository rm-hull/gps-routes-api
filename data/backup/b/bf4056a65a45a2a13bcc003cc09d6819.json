  "description": "Explore Eaves Wood and enjoy a climb to the Pepperpot on this walk in the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. There's nice footpaths taking you through shady ancient woodland with limestone pavement supporting rare plants and wildlife. The walk starts from the parking area on Park Road, just south of the woods. Follow the trail north to enter the woods where you can pick up the woodland trails heading west. The trails take you up to King William's Hill where you will find the Pepperpot monument. The unusual structure was built in 1887 to commemorate the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria. From the viewpoint there are splendid views over the coast to Grange over Sands. The woods are located just to the south of Arnside Knott. To extend your walk you could follow footpaths north across Middlebarrow Plain to the nearby viewpoint. Just to the south east you will find Leighton Moss Nature Reserve. There's nice paths taking you around several lakes and lagoons, with a large variety of birdlife to look out for. Our Silverdale Circular Walk passes through the woods. You could pick this up and visit the beach and village.",
