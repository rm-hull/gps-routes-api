  "description": "This North London based nature reserve includes some pleasant cycling and walking trails taking you around grassland, wildflower meadows, scrubland, waterways and a lake. The park is located in the London Borough of Haringey, near to Northumberland Park and Tottenham Hale Stations. You can start off from the on site car park and then pick up a circular trail around the site. Part of the route runs along the River Lee Navigation Canal and the Lockwood Reservoir on the eastern side of the park. The Lea Valley Walk can be followed south to additionally visit Walthamstow Marshes. Along the way there's lots of wildlife to look out for including skylark, short eared owl, pochard, tufted duck, coot, yellow wagtail, sedge warbler, great crested grebe and reed warbler.",
