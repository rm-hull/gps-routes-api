  "description": "This little Shropshire village has some pleasant walks through the River Worfe Valley to try. The historic settlement also includes some ancient timber framed buildings, a noteworthy Saxon church and views of the Davenport House Estate. It's located just east of Bridgnorth on the opposite side of the River Severn. This circular walk from the village first takes you past the old Davenport House to Burcote. You'll then visit the weir on the River Worfe before heading to Soudley Rocks, Rindleford and Bromley. The final section passes Worfield Mere and Hallon just west of the village.",
