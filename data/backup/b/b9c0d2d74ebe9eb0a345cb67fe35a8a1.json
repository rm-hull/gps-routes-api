  "description": "This walk takes you along the Moray Firth coast from Portsoy To Cullen. The scenic walk takes you along a splendid cliff top path for a distance of just under 7 miles. Along the way there are pretty beaches, wonderful rock formations and splendid sea views to enjoy. The route starts off at the attractive harbour in the town of Portsoy. You then follow the coastal path west to Sandend Bay where there is a pretty, secluded beach. You continue west to Carthie Point where there are some natural arches and the photogenic Findlater Castle . The striking 13th century castle ruins are located in a wonderful cliff top location just over half way along the route. From the castle you continue to Logie Head before descending into Cullen where you finish at the harbour. In Cullen you can pick up the Moray Coast Trail to extend your walk. The waymarked long distance trail can be followed west on the Buckie to Findochty and Cullen Coastal Walk .",
