  "description": "Visit the striking Cown Edge rocks on this walk through Greater Manchester and Derbyshire. The path starts at Hazel Grove and heads east towards Marple where you can enjoy waterside stretches along the Macclesfield Canal and the Peak Forest Canal with views of the River Goyt. Just east of Marple you then begin the ascent to Cown Edge, passing Mellor and Hollywood End on the way. Near Mellor there's a religous cross which marks the site where John Wesley preached during the 18th century. The path then takes you along Cown Edge Rocks and Coombe Edge Rocks where there are splendid views of the Peak District. At Coombe Edge the route turns west towards Charlesworth before taking you over the River Etherow to Werneth Low and then onto the finish point at Gee Cross.",
