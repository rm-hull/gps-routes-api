  "description": "This walk visits Kyloe Woods in the Northumberland National Park. It's a peaceful and serene place which is somewhat off the beaten track. There's miles of decent trails to follow around this expansive area of woodland, which lies just to the east of the coast at Lindisfarne . The forest also includes striking cliffs and rock faces which are popular with climbers and boulderers. At the eastern end of the woods you can also pick up the long distance St Cuthbert's Way . If you were to follow the waymarked footpath south it would take you to the historically fascinating St Cuthberts Cave .",
