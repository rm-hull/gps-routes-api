  "description": "The classic Cotswolds town of Tetbury has a number of lovely waymarked trails running past it. You can pick these up to explore the attractive countryside surrounding the town and to visit some of the local attractions. This walk makes use of the Monarch's Way and the Macmillan Way to visit the wonderful Westonbirt Arboretum, the 16th century Chavenage House and the nearby village of Avening. It's about a 10 mile walk in total with the option of getting the bus back from Avening to Tetbury. The walk starts at the southern section of the town where you can pick up the Monarch's Way and head south along Longfurlong Lane towards Westonbirt Arboretum. The arboretum is one of the highlights of the Cotswolds with 600 acres and 15,000 tree specimens to see. It is simply stunning the autumn months. After exploring the arboretum you then pick up the Macmillan Way and head north towards Beverston. The village is home to a Norman Church and  Beverstone Castle which dates from the 12th century. The path continues north to Chavenage House. The Elizabethan manor house was built in 1576 and is constructed of Cotswold stone. On certain days in the summer months you can tour the house and gardens. Click here for more details. The final section of the walk takes you through the countryside to Avening. Here you can enjoy refreshments at one of the two pubs before catching the bus back to Tetbury.",
