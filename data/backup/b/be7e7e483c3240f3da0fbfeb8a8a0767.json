  "description": "This attractive Cumbrian market town is located near the Lake District town of Kendal and the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. This walk from the town follows a pleasant section of the Cumbria Coastal Way to Levens Hall and Milnthorpe Sands. Along the way there's lovely views over the River Kent Estuary as you make your way along the scenic Milnthorpe Sands. At Levens Hall you can explore the lovely gardens of the historic hall where you will find some marvellous topiary. Towards the end of the walk you will pass very close to the Foulshaw Moss Nature Reserve. There's some nice trails here with lots of wildlife to look out for as well. The walk could be extended by contunuing on to the lovely town of Grange-over-Sands where you could visit the ancient Cartmel Priory.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area head south to climb to Arnside Knott. It's a popular walk with the elevated spot providing great views over Morecambe Bay. If you follow the River Bela south you will soon come to a local geological highlight at Beetham's Fairy Steps. Here you will find an unusual natural limestone staircase which you can climb for more excellent views. The little village of Beetham is also well worth exploring with its 14th century ruined manor house and a particularly lovely garden centre."
