  "description": "This circular walk climbs to White Edge on the Longshaw Estate in the Peak District National Park. The area has some wonderful geology, pretty heather and wonderful views from the high points. The walk additionally visits Barbrook Reservoir And Stone Circle on Big Moor to the east of the edge. You can start the walk from the Wooden Pole National Trust Car Park just to the north of the edge near Nether Padley. From here you can follow a footpath heading south across White Edge Moor and Big Moor. The route then turns north east towards Barbrook Reservoir where you could take a detour to visit the nearby ancient stone circle. The edge is often traversed in a circular walk with the nearby Curbar Edge and Froggatt Edge .",
