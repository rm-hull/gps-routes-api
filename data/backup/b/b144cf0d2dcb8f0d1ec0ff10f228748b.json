  "description": "A circular walk visiting the River Kent and Kendal Castle. The castle dates from the 12th century, sitting in a prominent position above the town on Castle Hill.  You can stroll around the atmospheric ruins and enjoy views over the town and the surrounding countryside. The walk starts on the river next to the Grade I listed Kendal Parish Church. Follow the river south to the Abbot Hall recreation ground and then cross over to the eastern side. The route then climbs to the castle on public footpaths, reaching a height of about 300ft. It's a photogenic spot with the Lake District fells making a splendid backdrop to the ruins of the old manor hall and surviving castle tower. After exploring the castle the walk descends back to the river where you can enjoy another waterside stroll before returning to the start point. There's plenty of other good options for extending your walking in the Kendal area. You could head west of the town and enjoy a climb to Scout Scar . This excellent viewpoint gives fine views towards some of the most well known Lakeland fells. There's also nice footpaths running south along the River Kent which takes you towards the lovely Sizergh Castle . The National Trusted owned estate contains miles of footpaths with pretty gardens, a lake and peaceful woodland in the adjacent Brigsteer Woods . Near here you will also find the splendid Levens Hall with its deer park and eye catching topiary. Head south west from the town and you will soon come to the Whitbarrow National Nature Reserve . Here you will find wonderful limestone scenery, ancient woodland and rich ground flora. Finally, the Miller's Way long distance trail also starts in Kendal. The challenging trail runs alll the way to Carlisle with wonderful views of the Howgills, the Pennines and the Eden Valley.",
