  "description": "This North Yorkshire seaside town is a hugely popular place for walkers. There's riverside trails, wonderful coastal paths, beautiful beaches and numerous fascinating historical sites to visit in the area. This walk explores the historic Whitby Abbey. The abbey is run by English Heritage and includes some pleasant footpaths taking your around the photogenic ruins of the gothic abbey. The 7th-century Christian monastery later became a Benedictine abbey dating from the 13th century. It's positioned in a wonderful spot overlooking the North Sea to the east of Whitby. The Cleveland Way National Trail runs past the abbey. You can pick up this waymarked footpath and follow it east on the popular Whitby to Robin's Hood Bay Walk. The nearby village of Robin's Hood Bay is particular picturesque and can be reached along a stunning section of coast. Heading west will take you along the Whitby to Runswick Bay Walk. To the south there's the Whitby to Ruswarp Circular Walk which will take you to the impressive Larpool Viaduct with views of the River Esk Estuary on the way.",
