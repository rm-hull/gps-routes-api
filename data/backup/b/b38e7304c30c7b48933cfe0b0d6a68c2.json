  "description": "Enjoy an easy circular walk around this pretty reservoir in Bury. It's a nice path with good views across the water where you'll often see little sailboats. The reservoir is also surrounded by some nice rolling countryside and woodland. You can continue to Withins Reservoir and Black Lane to extend the walk. The Irwell Sculpture Trail passes the reservoir along the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal so this is another good option. Cyclists can reach the reservoir by following National Cycle Route 6 from Bury or Radcliffe, where you can pick up the Outwood Trail through Outwood Country Park. You could also try our circular walk around Bury which visits the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal as well as the reservoir.",

      "content": "One nice option is to follow the Irwell river north to visit the popular Burrs Country Park. There's nice river trails and a good visitor centre in this attractive park. Near here there's also the climb to Holcombe Hill and Moor where you can visit the iconic Peel Tower. The worthy riverside settlements of Ramsbottom and Summerseat can also be explored around here. Just south of Ramsbottom there's Redisher Wood. In the woods there are peaceful woodland trails and water features including the Holcombe Brook, a picturesque lake and photogenic waterfalls. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
