  "description": "This Staffordshire village is most well known for the Alton Towers Theme Park but it also has some lovely walks to try. This circular walk uses Staffordshire Way to take you to one of the highlights of the area at Dimmingsdale . These lovely woods include waymarked footpaths taking you along a series of pools and streams with interesting sandstone outcrops and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The walk runs for just under 6 miles, rising to a height of over 700ft from the high points. Starting from the village you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it north west to the woods. At Hawksmoor you turn around and pass through Sutton's Wood before picking up the Ousal Dale Track and returning to the village. Here you can see the noteworthy Alton Castle. The gothic-rivival castle was constructed in the mid-19th century by\u00a0John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury. The original castle dates from the 12th century, built on a rocky precipice overlooking the\u00a0River Churnet. You can continue your walking in the area by trying our Churnet Valley Walk . Here you can enjoy waterside trails along the Caldon Canal and the River Churnet. To the east of the village there's nice trails to be found across the Weaver Hills . The hills climb to a height of over 1200ft offering fine views over the Peak District and the Churnet Valley. You could also take a small detour from the route and visit the village of Oakamoor on the River Churnet.",
