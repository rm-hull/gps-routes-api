  "description": "This small market town in Powys has some nice river trails and a pleasant local park to stroll through. There's also a noteworthy 14th century pub and the remains of the castle which was once one of Edward I\u2019s most important fortresses. The plethora of walking options in the wonderful Brecon Beacons and Cambrian Mountains are also not far away from the town. This riverside walk from takes you along a lovely section of the Wye Valley Walk from Builth to the neighbouring town of Newbridge on Wye. The walk starts in the town near to the photogenic bridge and the Groe, a pleasant riverside park in the town. There's car parking here, nice easy footpaths and the Gorsedd Circle to see here. In the park you can pick up the waymarked Wye Valley footpath and follow it north to Pen-ddol Rocks and Wye Bridge. You continue north past Goytre Wood and Estyn Wood before crossing the river and finishing in Newbridge.",
