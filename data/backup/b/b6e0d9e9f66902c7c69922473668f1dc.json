  "description": "Visit these beautiful 'hidden' waterfalls on this short walk in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The falls are located on the River Falloch in Glen Falloch, a few miles north of Loch Lomond.  The walk starts from the car park just off the A82 and follows a path through woodland to the falls. It's a delightful beauty spot with picnic benches and views of the River Falloch.",
