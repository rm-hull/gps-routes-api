  "description": "This delightful Oxfordshire village is in a great spot for exploring the surrounding countryside of the Berkshire Downs. It's a very pretty place with quaint thatched cottages, a fine old church, a village pub and lots of great options for walkers. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the D'arcy Dalton Way, the Lambourn Valley Way and The Ridgeway National Trail to visit two of the historic highlights of the area at Wayland's Smithy and the Uffington White Horse. You'll also pass the National Trust's Ashdown House which lies just to the south of the settlement. The 17th-century Dutch-style house is surrounded by scenic woodland and parkland with features including a maze, an ornamental parterre garden and Balleroy Highland ponies. On the route there are also some hill climbs with tremendous views over the surrounding North Wessex Downs AONB.",
