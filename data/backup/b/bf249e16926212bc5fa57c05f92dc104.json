  "description": "This delightful Oxfordshire village is in a great spot for exploring the surrounding countryside of the Berkshire Downs. It's a very pretty place with quaint thatched cottages, a fine old church, a village pub and lots of great options for walkers. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the D'arcy Dalton Way , the Lambourn Valley Way and The Ridgeway National Trail to visit two of the historic highlights of the area at Wayland's Smithy and the Uffington White Horse . You'll also pass the National Trust's Ashdown House which lies just to the south of the settlement. The 17th-century Dutch-style house is surrounded by scenic woodland and parkland with features including a maze, an ornamental parterre garden and Balleroy Highland ponies. On the route there are also some hill climbs with tremendous views over the surrounding North Wessex Downs AONB.",
