  "description": "Enjoy a walk around Hodbarrow Lakes RSPB on the edge of the Lake District National Park. You can stroll along the sea wall and enjoy fine views of the reserve's lakes on one side and the Duddon Estuary on the other. Look out for Teal, Widgeon, Coot, Mallard, Tufted Duck, Common Pochard, Goldeneye and Red-breasted Merganser as you make your way around the reserve. You can also sometimes see seals in the estuary. The reserve is located just a short walk from the centre of Millom. The Cumbria Coastal Way runs past the reserve so you could pick this up and head along the coast towards Ravenglass if you would like to continue your walk. A climb to Black Combe is also a good option.",
