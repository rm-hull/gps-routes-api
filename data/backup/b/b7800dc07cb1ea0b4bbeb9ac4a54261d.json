This historical church boasts a mix of architectural elements from different periods. The tower, porch, and south aisle of the church date back to the 15th century, representing a notable example of medieval architecture. In contrast, the north aisle is a Victorian addition. The chancel, believed to be the oldest part of the church, likely dates back to the 13th century. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brick flying buttresses, which support the structure."
