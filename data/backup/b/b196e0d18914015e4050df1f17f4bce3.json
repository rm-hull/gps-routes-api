  "description": "This village near Darlington has some nice country trails and a historic local castle to explore. The pretty village is in a good spot for exploring the surrounding Teesdale countryside. This walk from the village takes you south east to Selaby Hall Park to the south. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths south to Alwent Mill on the Langley Beck. From here it is a short walk east to Selaby Hall which dates from the mid 17th century. You can continue your walking around Staindrop by heading a short distance north to visit Raby Castle. There's 200 acres of deer park and gardens surrounding the 14th century castle.",
