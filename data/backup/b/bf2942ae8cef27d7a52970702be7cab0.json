This was built relatively recently as a solution to the continuous slippage of the canal towards the Afon Dyfrdwy (Cambrian River Dee) which had been a problem off and on since the canal was built. In places this trough is bolted to the solid rock to ensure it stays in place. (Thomas Telford and other canal engineers would have loved this technique if he had had it available 200 years ago). The durability of the concrete gets over the problem of bank erosion as well."

It's about a 4 mile walk along the flat towpath to the town and just over 8 miles for this circular walk which climbs above the canal to the north. The walk starts from the aqueduct car park near to the canal and the Trevor Basin. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it west through the Vale of Llangollen to the town. You then head north from the town to visit the historic Castell Dinas Bran. Here you can explore the ruins of a medieaval 13th century castle. There's also some fine views over the area from the elevated position of the castle. Near the site you can pick up the Offa's Dyke Path and follow it east towards the Panorama Walk. The route then heads south east through Trevor Wood before returning to Trevor.",
