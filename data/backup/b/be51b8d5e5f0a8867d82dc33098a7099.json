  "description": "A walk along Lake Windermere from Wray Castle to Ferry House. The route allows you to reach Bowness on foot from the National Trust property. It's a fairly easy walk of about 4 miles, following trails through peaceful woodland with nice views over the lake to enjoy on the way. The walk starts from Wray Castle, a National Trust owned property with attractive grounds to explore. From the car park you descend a short distance to the lake at Epley Point. You then follow the lake past Red Nab and Belle Grange Bay, with views of Belle Isle, the largest of Windermere's 18 islands. The walk finishes at Ferry House where you can catch the passenger ferry over to Bowness. On the other side you'll find a cafe with outdoor seating where you can relax and enjoy a view of the boats on the lake. You can extend your exercise by picking up our Bowness Walk and following a nice lakeside path around Cockshott Point to the village. On the eastern side of the water you pass beneath Claife Heights where there's some nice woodland trails and a number of pretty tarns.",
