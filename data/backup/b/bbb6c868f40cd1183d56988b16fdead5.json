  "description": "This area of common land is located near Ashford in the Kent Downs AONB. The area is also nature reserve\u00a0consisting of Kent's last four valley bogs and one of its few remaining fragments of open heath with patches of acid grassland. It is criss crossed with some nice marked footpaths and covered with interesting flora including heather,\u00a0cross-leaved heath, dwarf and common\u00a0gorse, heath spotted-orchid. You can start your walk from the public car park on the eastern end of the site, off the A20 road. From here you can pick up the colour coded trails taking you west towards the bogs. On the way look out for birdlife such as Yellowhammers, White Throat and Willow Warblers. You can also see the Konik horses which are used to graze the Heathlands in order to keep down invasive vegetation like bracken and silver birch. The Greensand Way long distance footpath runs across the western side of the common. You could pick up the waymarked trail to further explore the area if you have time. Follow it west and it will take you to the village of Pluckley which is closely associated with the 'Darling Buds of May'. Heading south east will take you toward Godinton Park and then into Ashford itself. The Stour Valley Walk also runs close by and is another good option.",
