By the 16th century trade was mainly in pilchards, reaching a high point in the 19th century. In 1850 there were 49 fishing boats based here. When I was a child in the 1960s, this was a quiet place where us local Cornish people came to get away from the crowds, but no longer! The Doc Martin series has made it even more popular"

  "description": "This walk follows a splendid section of the South West Coast Path from the historic castle at Tintagel to the little fishing village of Port Isaac. The picturesque village is the setting for ITV's 'Doc Martin' show starring Martin Clunes. It's another of the highlights of the area and well worth a visit. The route runs for a distance of just under 8 miles along an undulating path with fabulous views throughout. The walk starts on the coast at Tintagel and follows the waymarked path south to Trebarwith Strand. This area has 800m of sandy beach, contained by cliffs, in which natural caves are found. There is also a little village with shops and cafes. See the video below for more details. The route continues south to Tregardock where there is a cliff and beach of the same name. The final section takes you past Jacket's Point and Ranie Point before passing along Port Isaac Bay and finishing in the village. There's lots of quaint 18th century cottages to see on narrow winding streets in the charming village.",
