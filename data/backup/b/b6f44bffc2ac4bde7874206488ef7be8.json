  "description": "This lovely route follows National Cycle routes 12 and 51 and the Bedford to Sandy Country Way - an off road path perfect for walking or cycling.  The ride is very flat with views of the Rivers Great Ouse and Ivel plus a spell through Priory Country Park the main highlights. Also on the route is the National Trust owned Willington Dovecote & Stables - a Tudor stone-built stable, built for Henry VIII's 1541 visit.",
