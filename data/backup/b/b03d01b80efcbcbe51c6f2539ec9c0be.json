  "description": "Follow a good path to this stunning glacial\u00a0corrie in the Cairngorms. You start off from the Cairngorm Ski Centre car park and soon pick up the well maintained path to this spectacular corrie. As you climb you will see wonderful views of the Rothiemurchus Forest and Loch Morlich while crossing pretty streams on huge stepping stones. The surrounding glacial cliffs and huge boulders add to the dramatic nature of this stunning area. In the colder months you may see ice climbers attempting Magic Crack. The climb to Cairn Gorm also starts from the same car park so you can continue your walking in the area on this path.",
