  "description": "The pretty Dorset town of Wareham has some lovely waterside walks along the rivers which pass through the area. There's also the interesting walk along the historic town walls and a number of long distance trails running through the town. This circular walk takes you around the town visiting the River Piddle, Wareham Common, the town walls and the River Frome. The walk starts near the North Bridge and heads west along the Piddle towards Wareham Common. You then pick up a section of the Purbeck Way to take you to the west walls and south bridge where there are nice views of the River Frome. There's some good pubs and cafes with outdoor seating here. The walk then takes you along the east walls before returning to North Bridge where you pass the noteworthy St Martin's Church. The Anglo-Saxon church is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument, dating from 1030. On the north wall of the chancel are 12th-century frescoes depicting Saint Martin on horseback. The long distance Purbeck Way passes through the town and is a great way of extending your walking in the area. Following it south will take you to Stoborough Heath and the village of Corfe Castle where you will find the fascinating ruins of the 11th century ruined castle. The Wareham Forest Way also passes through the area. Head north and you can explore the River Piddle Valley before passing through the conifer plantations of the forest where you can look out for an abundance of wildlife.",
