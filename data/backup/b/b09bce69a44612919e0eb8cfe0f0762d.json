  "description": "This Worcestershire based town has some nice trails along the canals and rivers which run through the area. It's also near to the woodland of the Wyre Forest and the popular walking trails at Kinver Edge. This circular walk from the town takes you along a section of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal to the nearby village of Kinver. Here you enjoy a climb to Kinver Edge before a visit to the adjacent Kingsford Country Park. It's a nice varied route with easy waterside sections, peaceful woodland trails and a climb to a splendid viewpoint. The walk starts on the canal in the town centre, just a short distance west from the bus station and train station. Here you can pick up the towpath and follow it north to Wolverley, Cookley and Kinver. There's nice views of the River Stour on the way as it runs parallel with canal on this section. The route then leaves the canal to head west through Kinver before turning south along a section of the Staffordshire Way. This will take you up onto Kinver Edge where you can enjoy fine views over the area. You then descend to Kingsford Country Park where there are a number of fine woodland trails with hills, cliffs and sandy paths too. After exploring the park you can continue east along the waymarked trail to Caunsall where you pick up the canal towpath again. This will lead you south back into the town centre.",
