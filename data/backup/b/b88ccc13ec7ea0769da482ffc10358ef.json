  "description": "This large open space near Selby has three colour coded, waymarked walks to try. There's 270 hectares of open heath, ponds, reed-bed and woodland to explore on miles of trails. The common is a nature reserve so look out for a wide variety of flora and fauna. Of particular note are the Exmoor ponies and a herd of wild fallow deer and roe deer. There are also a number of rare plants, including the unusual sundew, which is only found in the peat bogs and damp moorland of the common. The site includes boardwalks and viewing platforms from which to conveniently observe the plantlife and wildlife. You can also visit the nearby village of Skipwith with its church of St. Helen which dates back to the 10th century. Also of note are the Danes Hills Bronze age burial mounds and a number of pretty ponds. About a mile to the west of the common you can pick up the Trans Pennine Trail in Riccall. The epic long distance trail is a great way of extending your walking in the area. You could follow it south into Selby or north into Bishopthorpe.",
