    "description": "There's lots of fairly easy walks to enjoy around the cathedral city of Peterborough. Three notable long distance trails run through the area and there's also river walks, country parks and nature reserves to visit. This riverside walk takes you from the city centre to Ferry Meadows Country Park along the River Nene. There's much to enjoy with flat waterside trails, pretty lakes, old bridges and views of the Nene Valley Steam Railway which runs along much of the route. The walk starts on the river in the city centre, just to the south of the tourist information centre and train station. From here you can pick up a section of the Nene Way long distance trail to take you west along the river and into Nene Park. After a short while you will come to the Woodston Ponds Nature Reserve. Here you will find a lake with water birds such as grey herons, tufted ducks and pochards. There's also a reedbed which has pools and channels, with great crested newts and unusual species of water beetle to see. You continue west through Thorpe Meadows where there is a Sculpture Park and a purpose built rowing lake. The next stage passes the water features of Orton Meadows before entering the splendid Ferry Meadows Country Park . You can follow various trails around the large lakes, pretty meadows and pockets of woodland. There's also two cafes where you can enjoy refreshments before the returning to the city centre the same way. Alternatively you could catch the Nene Valley Railway back. To extend the walk you can continue west along the Nene Way to Wansford , Yarwell and Nassington . The path runs along the river with lovely views of the surrounding Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire countryside. Heading east will take you to Whittlesey where the long distance Hereward Way branches away from the Nene Way. The city is located very close to the Great Fen where you can visit Holme Fen and look out for a huge variety of wildlife.",
