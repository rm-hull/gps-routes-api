The climb to Birnam Hill can also be found just south of Dunkeld. There are some excellent views from this fine vantage point. Heading east along the river from the town will take you to the famous Birnam Oak, an ancient tree mentioned in Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. You can enjoy more waterside walking around the Loch of the Lowes and Loch Clunie. There's also Tay Forest Park with miles of good walking and cycling trails to try."
