It starts shallow and the bouldery bed has a tendency to knock paddlers off their intended line, especially at low water. The prudent canoeist wants to cut across towards the inside of the bend to finish left of centre through this stopper - in low water there is a large rock to be avoided, while at a level even higher than in this shot, the stopper gets quite big. This Swaledale Outdoor Club trip took place in quite wet conditions - at this level the Racing stretch is a blast!"

  "description": "This picturesque village in County Durham is surrounded by some beautiful Teesdale countryside. There's also a noteworthy Saxon Church and a fine 18th century coaching inn to relax in after your exercise. This route from the village uses a section of the Teesdale Way to create a circular walk around the village. The walk starts in the village and follows the waymarked trail south to Low Garth and the river. You then follow a riverside path south to Cotherstone where there's a bridge over the river at the point where the River Balder meets with the River Tees. Cross here and then follow the river north through Shipley Wood to the Raygill Beck. The route then passes Barnley before coming to the neighbouring village of Egglestone where you cross the river on Egglestone Bridge. You then head south past Hewcroft Hill before returning to Romaldkirk.",
