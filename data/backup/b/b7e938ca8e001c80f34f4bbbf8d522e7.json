  "description": "This walk takes you from the village of Baslow to the splendid Chatsworth Park in Derbyshire. You can follow the Derwent Valley Heritage Way from the village centre all the way to the famous park and house. It's about 1.5 to 2 mile walk along a fairly flat path so suitable for most abilities. Along the way there's nice views of the surrounding hills and the River Derwent which runs alongside the park. At Chatsworth you'll find 1000 acres of parkland to explore with more views of the River Derwent, woodland trails and fallow deer.",
