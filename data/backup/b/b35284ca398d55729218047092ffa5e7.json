  "description": "Follow the Jock's Road from Glendoll to Braemar on this long distance walk in Glen Clova. The route has an interesting history, relating to Duncan Macpherson, a rich Scot, who returned from Australia in the late 19th century, bought the Glen Doll estate, and sought to ban people from crossing his land. A local shepherd, Jock Winter fought him, and the Scottish Rights of Way Society took a challenge through all the courts to the House of Lords, finally winning the day in 1888. You can now walk the length of 13 mile route through the beautiful scenery of Glen Callater and Glen Doll, on the edge of the Cairngorms. Start the walk from the parking area in Glendoll. From here you can pick up the heading through the wonderful Corrie Fee Nature Reserve. The area is rich with wildlife and also includes beautiful alpine flowers with rare mountain willows clinging to the steep crags of the bowl shaped valley. The route heads west through the forest, passing along White Water and Craig Damff. The steady climb continues to Cairn Lunkard and Crow Craigies, which marks the high point of the route at nearly 3000ft. From here the path descends along the waters of Allt an Loch before coming to the lovely Loch Callater. There's a nice path running along the eastern side of the water here. The final section runs along the Callater Burn through Glen Callater before finishing just south of the town of Braemar. There's also a car park at this end of the walk so you could potentially start from here if you prefer. To continue your walking in the area head to Glen Clova and enjoy an easier walk up to the lovely Loch Brandy .",
