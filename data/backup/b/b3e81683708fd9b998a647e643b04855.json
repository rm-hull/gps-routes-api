  "description": "This walk takes you through the Snowdonia National Park from Barmouth, on the Mawddach Estuary, to Llandecwyn. The route is divided into three sections: Southern: Barmouth to Tal y Bont (8 miles) Central: Tal y Bont to Harlech (13 miles) Northern: Harlech to Llandecwyn (12 miles). Highlights on the walk include the lovely views of the Mawddach Estuary at Barmouth (video below), fabulous views of the Rhinogydd range of mountains in Snowdonia and the Bryn Cader Faner Bronze Age round cairn towards the end of the route. Also look out for buzzards and red kites as these are regularly seen on the trail. There are challenging climbs on the walk but you will be rewarded with some of the best coastal/mountain views in Wales. The walk is waymarked with a Buzzard logo. In Barmouth the route links with the Mawddach Trail. A splendid cycling and walking trail which takes you along the Mawddach Estuary.",
