On the right-hand tree is a small fire lookout. Taken from a forest track which runs parallel to the stream, through a cleared corridor close to the southern edge of this large forested area."

In fact, a cycle / footpath (the Ruby Trail) runs alongside to the north. Here, the remains of an embanked stretch would have carried the line across a small stream."

  "description": "These woods are located near Holsworthy in Devon. At the site you'll find 400 acres of mixed coniferous woodland and open moorland with a network of trails. Start the walk from the Cookworthy car park near Muckworth and Beaworthy. From here you can pick up a bridle track heading north past the Dismantled Railway Line to Whiteleigh Meadow and the Weekpark Plantation. The trails are good for both walking and cycling.",
