In fact, a cycle / footpath (the Ruby Trail) runs alongside to the north. Here, the remains of an embanked stretch would have carried the line across a small stream."

Start the walk from the Cookworthy car park near Muckworth and Beaworthy. From here you can pick up a bridle track heading north past the Dismantled Railway Line to Whiteleigh Meadow and the Weekpark Plantation. The trails are good for both walking and cycling.",
