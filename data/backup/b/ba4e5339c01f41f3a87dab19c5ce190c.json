  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this large coastal forest near Nairn.  There are a huge number of tracks to choose from including the easy Hill 99 trail which is waymarked. The route below begins at the car park at the Culbin Forest Nature Reserve and takes you around the forest on various tracks. The route includes a visit to the Culbin Sands Nature Reserve on the coast at Nairn. Here you can see a variety of coastal birds including  bar-tailed godwits, oystercatchers and knots. The route then heads back through the forest passing a series of idyllic woodland lochs before returning to the start point. Other highlights in the forest include the beautiful Findhorn Bay where you can see ospreys and seals at the river-mouth and a view over the water towards the village of Findhorn. You can also climb the Hill 99 viewpoint trail where there are fabulous views of the surrounding area from the top of the viewpoint tower. National Cycle Network Route route 1 runs just past the forest so there is scope for continuing your ride if you have time. The forest is located about 16 miles north east of Inverness.",
