  "description": "This nice waterside walk takes you around Elsecar Reservoir before picking up a footpath along the Elsecar Branch Canal. Along the way there are lots of interesting old buildings related to the village's mining history. You can find out more at the excellent Elsecar Heritage Centre which contains the only Newcomen steam engine in the world to have remained in its original location. The walk starts from the parking area in Elsecar Park. From here you can pick up nice footpaths taking you around the pretty park with its woodland, flower beds and bandstand. Trails then lead you around the reservoir which is also a nature reserve where you can look out for a variety of wildlife. The route then passes the heritage centre and the train station belonging to the Elsecar Heritage Railway. The railway runs steam and diesel locomotives, between Rockingham station (at the back of the Elsecar Heritage Centre) and Hemingfield Basin. Just past the station you can pick up the canal-side path and follow it to Wombwell. Part of this walk uses sections of the Barnsley Boundary Walk and the Trans Pennine Trail. You could extend the walk by continuing along the trails into Barnsley. Also in the Barnsley area you will find Worsbrough Mill Country Park. The park includes a 60 acre reservoir and a 17th Century working water mill set in 240 acres of lovely parkland.",
