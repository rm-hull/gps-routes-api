The walk may be continued through the archway on to Fishbourne."

  "description": "This walk visits the historic Quar Abbey, near Fishbourne and Ryde on the northern coast of the Isle of Wight. The Grade I listed monastery has a fascinating history dating back to the 12th century. It includes a lovely estate where you can enjoy a stroll in delightful natural surroundings. There's well maintained gardens, a wildflower meadow and woodland trails where you can look out for red squirrels and other wildlife. Look out for the ruins of the old abbey which include the wonderful backdrop of the Solent. To extend the walk you could pick up the Isle of Wight Coast Path and follow it west to visit the picturesque Wootton Creek. Heading east will take you into Ryde where you could try the popular Ryde to Bembridge Coastal Walk .",

The site includes lots of wildlife and views of the picturesque Wootton Bridge Old Mill Pond on its western side. Near here there's also the Isle of Wight Heritage Steam Railway train centre at Havenstreet Station, where the old trains make their way to join the electrified Ryde-Shanklin line at Smallbrook. The quaint station has been carefully restored to reflect a 1940s British Railways (Southern) style station. There is also a nice cafe and exhibits here. The station is located just a mile south of the woods at postcode PO33 4DS."
