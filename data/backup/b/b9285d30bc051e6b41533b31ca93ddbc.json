  "description": "This walk takes you from Grassington to the nearby village of Conistone. On the way you'll visit the rocky outcrop of Conistone Pie and Conistone Dib, an interesting dry valley in a limestone gorge. The walk starts in Grassington where you can pick up the Dales Way long distance trail. Follow the waymarked path north from the town to Lea Green and Conistone Pie. Here you will find an unusual rock outcrop which is said to resemble an apple pie. From the elevated position of the pie there are splendid views over Wharfdale and Swineber Scar. After taking in the views the route turns south and then west to visit Conistone Dib. The dib is in a dry limestone gorge with more interesting scenery to admire. The path through the dib descends into the attractive village of Conistone where there is a stone arch bridge over the River Wharfe and a noteworthy church which dates from around the 12th century. You can turn it into a circular walk by following Grass Wood Lane south back towards Grassington. To continue your walking in the area you could head a short distance north west of Conistone to visit Kilnsey Park and enjoy views of the distinctive Kilnsey Crag. In the park there's also the Caf\u00e9 by the Lake where you can relax outside and enjoy fine views over the Yorkshire Dales while enjoying a good home cooked dish from the menu.",
