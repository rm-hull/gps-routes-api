Near here there's also the picturesque Loch Ettrick. It's a small but very beautiful loch surrounded by attractive woodland trails in the adjacent Ae Forest. The long distance Romans and Reivers Route starts in the forest. This 52 mile route follows the old Roman Roads to Hawick in the Scottish Borders. Following the trail north east will take you to Moffat where you can enjoy a riverside walk along the River Annan on the Annadale Way. A few miles to the east there's the larger Daer Reservoir where there are some nice waterside trails. It is located near the Southern Upland Way long distance trail."
