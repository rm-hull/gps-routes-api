  "description": "Enjoy a lovely stroll around this pretty reservoir in the fantastic Brecon Beacons. The nearby mountains of Pen Y Fan and Corn Du make a simply stunning backdrop to the walk. The walk also includes woodland sections on the western side of the reservoir and several waterside sections. If you're looking for a more challenging walk you could climb Pen Y Fan. The start point for this walk is near the northern end of the reservoir. This walk also makes use of the Brecon Beacons Way so you could pick this up and head deeper into this beautiful national park.",
