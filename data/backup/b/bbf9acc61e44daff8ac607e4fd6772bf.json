  "description": "This route takes you along a fine section of the North Wales Coast Path from Llandudno to Conwy. There's much to enjoy with a visit to the splendid Great Orme and a stretch along the beautiful Conwy Sands. The walk starts on the promenade in Llandudno, next to the impressive pier. You then follow the coast path round the wonderful limestone headland of Great Orme. On the western side of Llandudno you will come to Conwy Sands with its lovely dunes and views across Conwy Bay. The path continues past the small town of Deganwy with its attractive Quay and the dark age fortress of Deganwy Castle . Just south of here you have the option of visiting the lovely Conwy RSPB reserve. It's slightly off the route but well worth a visit if you have time. The site includes grassland, scrubland, reedbeds, salt marsh and mudflats. You can look out for hundreds of bird species such as lapwing, little ringed plover, skylark and reed warbler. This route crosses the Conwy Suspension Bridge over the River Conwy to take you into the town. Here you can visit the medieval Conwy Castle. It was built by Edward I, during his conquest of Wales, between 1283 and 1289. For a fee you can explore the fine structure and climb the battlements for breathtaking views across mountains and sea. To extend the walk you can continue west along the North Wales Path to Conwy Mountain . It's a splendid climb with lots of pretty heather and wonderful views over the mountains of Snowdonia.",
