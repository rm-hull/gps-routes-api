The railway was subsequently absorbed into the Great Northern Railway in 1883, but Nast Hyde Halt was not built until 1910. Passenger services on the railway were an early casualty of the pre-Beeching era of British Railways, closing just 3 years into Nationalization in 1951, with the halt obviously closing at the same time. Freight traffic on the line lingered into the 1960s, and the track was still in use in 1967."

It is a shared cycle and walk path and makes for an easy and safe stroll or ride. The route runs for about 6 miles with nice views of the countryside along the way. If you enjoy this ride then you could also try the Cole Green Way . It's another traffic free rail trail running from Welwyn Garden City to Hertford. See the St Albans Cycle Routes page for more rides around the area.",
