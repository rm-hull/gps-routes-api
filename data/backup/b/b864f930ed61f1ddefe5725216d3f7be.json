At 85 metres long, it has the longest nave of any cathedral in England."

The railway was subsequently absorbed into the Great Northern Railway in 1883, but Nast Hyde Halt was not built until 1910. Passenger services on the railway were an early casualty of the pre-Beeching era of British Railways, closing just 3 years into Nationalization in 1951, with the halt obviously closing at the same time. Freight traffic on the line lingered into the 1960s, and the track was still in use in 1967."

There's a cosy interior featuring wooden beams, lime plastered walls, two fireplaces and low ceilings. Outside there's a lovely garden area and terrace where you can enjoy views of the surrounding fields with your meal. The inn is located just south of the route as you approach Nast Hyde Halt and Hatfield. You can find them on Sleapshyde Lane with a postcode of AL4 0SE for your sat navs."

Could use a few more signposts, though.\" \"Alban Way is ideal for commuting between Hatfield and St Albans. Smooth tarmac, no hills\u2014just pure cycling joy. Great way to enjoy greenery without straying too far from civilisation.\" \"It\u2019s lovely for a stroll, but the cyclists zoom by without warning. Be sure to keep pets on a leash. Nice bit of history with the old platforms, though!\" \"Highly recommend for beginners and casual cyclists. It\u2019s safe, traffic-free, and offers a glimpse into the area's railway past. Perfect on a sunny afternoon.\" \"Great trail, but some crossings can be tricky if you're not familiar with the route. That said, the peaceful atmosphere and lack of steep gradients make up for it!\""
