  "description": "Waseley Hills is a country park and Local Nature Reserve located on the south western edge of Birmingham. The park covers 150 acres and consists of rolling open hills, pastures and small pockets of woodland with panoramic views over Worcestershire from Windmill Hill. It also includes the source of the River Rea where there is an information board about the course of the river and its wildlife. The North Worcestershire Path runs through the park so you could continue your walk and visit the nearby Lickey Hills Country Park. The park is also the start point for the Illey Way. The path runs along an old railway line from Waseley Hills to Woodgate near Halesowen. You can pick up the waymarked trail from the car park.",
