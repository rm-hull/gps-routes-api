  "description": "This walk takes you along the Beeston Canal in Nottingham. The towpath along the canal was completed in 1982 and is now used as an easy cycle or walking route. The walk starts from Beeston Lock on the River Trent near the city centre. From here you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it north east through Rylands and then on into the city centre. At the western end of the canal you'll find the Attenborough Nature Reserve. You could extend your walk by heading south west through the reserve where there are a number of lakes and lots of wildlife to look out for.",
