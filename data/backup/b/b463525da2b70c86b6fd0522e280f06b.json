  "description": "This large Devon based village is located on the southern edge of the Dartmoor National Park. It's a fine place to start a walk with riverside trails, an old tramway and waymarked footpaths across the surrounding moorland. This circular walk from South Brent takes you north along the River Avon to visit the photogenic Avon Dam. You can follow waterside paths along the picturesque lake and then pick up the Two Moors Way at the Huntingdon Cross. The waymarked long distance trail will take you along the old tramway to Quickbeam Hill and Ugborough Moor where there are some excellent views over the Avon Valley. The area is also covered in interesting ancient sites with hut circles, enclosures and barrows, all dating from the Bronze Age. At Glasscombe Ball you head east to Owley Moor before following quiet country lanes back into South Brent.",
