  "description": "This Rutland based village sits very close to the Rutland Water dam with its waterside walking and cycling routes. This circular walk from the village uses some of the local walking trails to visit Rutland Water and the neighbouring villages of Edith Weston and Ketton. The walk starts in the village and follows the Hereward Way west to Rutland Water. Here you can pick up a shared cycling and walking trail running south along the dam. The trail will take you to Edith Weston where you can pick up a pleasant country lane heading east towards Ketton. At Ketton you pick up the Macmillan Way and follow it north west through the countryside to return to Empingham.",

      "content": "Just to the north there's the neighbouring village of Exton. There's a pleasant circular walk here taking you around the parkland of the old Exton Hall before visiting the two pretty lakes at Fort Henry. In the village you could also visit the noteworthy Barnsdale Gardens. The beautiful gardens were created by former Gardener's World presenter Geoff Hamilton during the 1980s and 1990s. They are now open to the public and include Britain's largest collection of individually designed gardens. Highlights are the ornamental kitchen garden, a cottage garden and the Versailles garden. Near here there's Clipsham where you can enjoy a stroll along the tranquil Yew Tree Avenue with its splendid topiary. The pretty village also includes an award winning pub for refreshments afterwards."
