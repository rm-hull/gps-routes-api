  "description": "This Rutland based village sits very close to the Rutland Water dam with its waterside walking and cycling routes. This circular walk from the village uses some of the local walking trails to visit Rutland Water and the neighbouring villages of Edith Weston and Ketton. The walk starts in the village and follows the Hereward Way west to Rutland Water. Here you can pick up a shared cycling and walking trail running south along the dam. The trail will take you to Edith Weston where you can pick up a pleasant country lane heading east towards Ketton. At Ketton you pick up the Macmillan Way and follow it north west through the countryside to return to Empingham.",
