    "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around this beautiful lake in Snowdonia. The lake has nice paths along the water and through the surrounding woodland, with great views towards the mountains of Snowdonia. The lake links with Llyn Dinas where there are more nice trails to try. The Snowdon Watkin Path also starts from the nearby Nant Gwynant car park so you could try this challenging climb to extend your walk. If you don't feel like climbing all the way to the summit then you could try the start of the path which is very pretty. It takes you through woodland to the Afon Cwm Llan where there are some lovely waterfalls. If you head north along the Afon Glaslyn you could also visit Llyn Llydaw, one of the most visited lakes in the country.",
