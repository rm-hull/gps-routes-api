  "description": "This 52 mile walking route runs from Little Vantage to Hawick through some beautiful Scottish Borders countryside. It runs along the old drove road where cattle and sheep were driven through West Linton to Peebles and Traquair, and then on to Hawick via the Yarrow Valley. The route starts at Little Vantage near Harperrig Reservoir in the Pentland Hills, just south west of Edinburgh.",

      "content": "In Peebles the route links up with the Tweed Valley Railway Path. The shared cycling and walking trail runs from Innerleithen to Peebles along the old railway line. It makes up part of the long distance Tweed Cycleway which runs from Berwick-Upon-Tweed to Biggar. You can continue your exploration of the old railway on the Neidpath Tunnel Walk in the town as well. This will take you along the railway line to the Neidpath Viaduct before entering the murky tunnel. You can also access the excellent mountain bike trails and waymarked walks in the expansive Glentress Forest near here. Hawick is also the start/finish point for the Romans and Reivers Route. This 52 mile route follows the old Roman Roads to the Ae Forest near Moffat. The Borders Abbeys Way can also be linked with here. Also nearby is the Gypsy Glen Walk. The multi user route explores Cardrona Forest and the hills to the south of Peebles. It is popular with mountain bikers. For cyclists the new Kirkpatrick C2C passes through Hawick. The epic Coast to Coast route runs across the south of Scotland from Stranraer to Eyemouth."
