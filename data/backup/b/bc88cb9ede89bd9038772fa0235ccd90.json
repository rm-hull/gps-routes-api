  "description": "This walk takes you from Bewdley to Great Malvern where you can enjoy splendid views of the Malvern Hills. The path starts on the River Severn in Bewdley and heads south, passing the villages of Abberley and Martley on your way to Great Malvern. The walk also takes you through the delightful Ravenshill Woodland Reserve and the Teme Valley where you can enjoy a short riverside section along the River Teme. The final section is particularly lovely as you pass through the glorious Malvern Hills before finishing in the town of Great Malvern. You can extend the walk by continuing to the southern end of the Malverns and visiting the British Camp Iron Age Hill Fort  on Herefordshire Beacon.",
