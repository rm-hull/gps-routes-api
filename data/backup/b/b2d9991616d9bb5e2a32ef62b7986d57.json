  "description": "A circular walk offering splendid views of the Cornish countryside and coast around St Ives and St Just. The walk begins at the beautiful resort of St Ives, taking you past the harbour and pier and around St Ives head. The path then climbs through or past Venton Vision, Trowan, Trevalgan, Trevega, Trendrine, Boscubben, Wicca, Lower Tregerthen and Tremedda, mostly at between 350 and 400 feet â€“ before descending to the pretty little village of Zennor. From Zennor you continue to Higher Porthmeor, Rosemergy and Pendeen on an easy section of the walk which passes farms and the old flour mill at Trewey. The path then heads from Pendeen towards Cape Cornwall passing the interesting Geevor Mine Museum and the charming Lower Boscaswell village before joining the coast path to Cape Cornwall. The coastal views from here are wonderful with Land's End just four miles away. This section also passes the Kenidjack Valley and the fascinating Botallack Mine, a National Trust owned site where you can explore the ancient mining engine houses. At Cape Cornwall you join the Tinners Way and turn back east towards the delightful town of St Just with galleries and tea shops to enjoy. You then cross a series of heather covered commons with various landmarks of historical interest including Tregeseal Stone Circle, Chun Quoit and Castle, and Bosullow Trehyllys iron age settlement. The path continues through Bosullow Common and onto Towednack, passing the fascinating Nine Maidens stone circle and the Bodrifty Iron Age Village on the way. The final section takes you from the pretty village of Towdenack and descends to the finish point back at St Ives.",
