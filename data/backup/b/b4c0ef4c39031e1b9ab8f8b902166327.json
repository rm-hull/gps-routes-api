  "description": "This walk from the Northamptonshire town of Kettering takes you along the River Ise to the nearby Boughton House. The walk starts on the eastern fringes of the town where you can pick up a public footpath and follow it north toward Warkton, with a riverside footpath along the way. The walk continues north west through Weekley before coming to Boughton Park. There's nice views from the footpath over the estate which is open at certain times of the year (typically bank holiday weekends in the summer months). Inside the grounds you will find 18th-century landscaped gardens, woodlands and a grand country park. The house is also stunning being labelled \u2018The English Versailles\u2019. Inside you'll find one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding collections of fine art, furniture, tapestries, porcelain and carpets. There's also paintings by El Greco and Gainsborough in the extensive art gallery. After enjoying the views of the park you can return to Kettering along the same paths. You could also continue along the roadside to Geddington if you have time.",
