  "description": "Follow this disused railway line from Wheathampstead to Welwyn Garden City on this easy cycle or walk in Hertfordshire. It's a nice flat, traffic free path making it ideal for families or beginners looking for an easy cycle ride. Along the way there's good views of the River Lea and a woodland section through Sherrardspark Wood at the end of the route. The woods are also a nature reserve with lots of birdlife and butterflies to look out for. If you're on foot you can extend your walk by picking up the Lea Valley Walk which runs alongside the greenway. If you're on a bike then you could head east to Hertford from Welwyn Garden City along the Cole Green Way . It's another similar rail trail along National Cycle Route 61 . This route runs along National Cycle Route 57 which heads west towards Northleach in the Cotswolds.",
