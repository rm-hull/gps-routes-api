  "description": "Enjoy a lovely walk on the lochside path in this country park in Lanark. The loch is surrounded by some truly beautiful countryside and in the summer you can hire bumper boats. There's also a putting green, a picnic area and play park so it's a nice day out for families. The park is about 1 mile from Lanark train station and has on site parking. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Falls of Clyde Nature Reserve where you can enjoy woodlands, waterfalls and a walk along the River Clyde. You can also pick up the Clyde Walkway here.",
