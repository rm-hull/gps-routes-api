The walk runs along a coastal path with wonderful views over the Aran Islands, Galway Bay, Connemara and the hills of the Burren. Fanore includes a popular beach and sand dunes (known as the \"Rabbit Warren\") around the mouth of the Caher River. Fanor is also notable as the longest village in Europe. You can continue your walking in the area on the Ballyvaughan Wood Loop Walk. On the circular walk you can visit the wonderful Aillwee Cave system with its underground river and waterfall.",
