  "description": "This circular walk explores the dramatic Blackness Castle on the Firth of Forth in Linlithgow. The 15th century castle has a fascinating history with a small exhibition in the former barracks outside. You can also climb the towers for splendid views across the Firth of Forth. There's some nice footpaths to follow around the castle lawns and then onto the beaches of Blackness Bay. You can reach the castle from the historic town of Bo'ness on the Bo'ness To Blackness Walk . It's about a 4 mile walk along a shared cycling and walking path.",
