Reached by a 400m level walk from the Upper Ailwee Cave carpark and a quick descent to the foot of the crag. Not only is the climbing rather fine, but the situation and view too"

      "content": "Head south west along the coast and you can pick up the popular Doolin to Cliffs of Moher Walk. The wonderful cliff top hike runs from the little village of Doolin to the Moher Tower at the southern end. There's fabulous sea views and lots of seabirds to look out for on this major local walking highlight. The long distance Burren Way runs through the village. The trail runs from Lahinch to Corofin and could be followed to the Cliffs of Moher from Ballyvaughan. Head south east into the heart of the Burren National Park and you could try the Lough Avalla Farm Loop. Another well trodden path it winds through the historic site of an ancient Celtic farm and briefly follows the picturesque shoreline of Lough Avalla. Near here there's also Lough Bunny, a Special Area of Conservation with stunning views of Mullaghmore Mountain. To the east there's more waterside walking on the Gort River Walk. The pleasant circular loop walk runs for about 3km along easy footpaths and country lanes around the historic town."
