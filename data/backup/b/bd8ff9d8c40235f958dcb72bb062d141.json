A nice limestone climbing crag near Ballyvaughan in Clare with +50 routes of 10-25m mostly in grades V.Diff. to Hard Severe, but with one E1 in the guide. Reached by a 400m level walk from the Upper Ailwee Cave carpark and a quick descent to the foot of the crag. Not only is the climbing rather fine, but the situation and view too"

  "description": "This circular walk explores Ballyvaughan Wood in the little harbour village of Ballyvaughan, County Clare. The popular walk runs for about 8km and is waymarked with Purple Arrows. On the way you'll enjoy peaceful woodland trails, limestone scenery, coastal views and the glorious countryside of the Burren. At the south eastern section of the walk you'll pass close to the Aillwee Cave and Birds of Prey Centre attraction. Here you can explore a wonderful cave system wtih an underground river and a waterfall as well as some large stalactites and stalagmites. To continue your walking in the area head north east to visit Flaggy Shore. There's some wonderful geological features and fine views to Aughinish Island, Galway Bay, the surrounding mountains and the wider Atlantic Ocean.",
