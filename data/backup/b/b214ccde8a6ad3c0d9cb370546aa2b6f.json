  "description": "This small town in Bedfordshire is located close to two rivers where you can enjoy some easy waterside walking. The settlements of Letchworth, Hitchin and Biggleswade are also nearby. This walk from the village takes you north along the River Hiz to Church End. You'll pass through the pretty Old Moat Nature Reserve which was associated with the old manor of Arlesey Manor. There's woodland and grassy glades here with lots of flora and fauna to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for kingfisher, chiffchaff, willow warbler, dragonflies and frogs as you make your way through the area. The path forms part of the Hicca Way, a long distance trail that can be followed all the way to Hitchin. Start the walk in the village and then head west to cross the river. You can then follow a riverside footpath north to Church End where there's some woodland and the Arlesey Bridge railway station. At the end of the walk you could pick up the Kingfisher Way and follow the waymarked footpath north towards Henlow and the River Ivel.",

      "content": "Just to the east you could visit the delightful Stotfold Mill on the River Ivel. The historic mill includes a nature reserve positioned on the long distance Kingfisher Way. The restored Grade II listed mill also includes a 4.4 metre wide corn mill waterwheel which is the widest in the country. On open days you can explore the 3 floors of the watermill and learn all about the history of the milling process. To the west the John Bunyan Trail can be picked up around Shefford. A few miles to the west there's Silsoe where you can enjoy easy trails around Wrest Park. There's 92 acres of landscaped early eighteenth-century gardens to explore here. You can also enjoy a pleasant stroll around Silsoe village where there are a number of historic properties associated with the park estate. For more walking ideas in the area see the Chilterns Walks and the Bedfordshire Walks pages."
