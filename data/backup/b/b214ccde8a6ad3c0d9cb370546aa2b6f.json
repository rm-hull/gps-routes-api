  "description": "This small town in Bedfordshire is located close to two rivers where you can enjoy some easy waterside walking. The settlements of Letchworth, Hitchin and Biggleswade are also nearby. This walk from the village takes you north along the River Hiz to Church End. You'll pass through the pretty Old Moat Nature Reserve which was associated with the old manor of Arlesey Manor. There's woodland and grassy glades here with lots of flora and fauna to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for kingfisher, chiffchaff, willow warbler, dragonflies and frogs as you make your way through the area. The path forms part of the Hicca Way, a long distance trail that can be followed all the way to Hitchin. Start the walk in the village and then head west to cross the river. You can then follow a riverside footpath north to Church End where there's some woodland and the Arlesey Bridge railway station. At the end of the walk you could pick up the Kingfisher Way and follow the waymarked footpath north towards Henlow and the River Ivel.",
