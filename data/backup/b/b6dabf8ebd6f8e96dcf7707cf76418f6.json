  "description": "This 100 acre park is located in the Smethwick area of Birmingham. It is a Green Flag award winning community park and in 2012 it was voted the nation's 2nd favourite park. The woods are the perfect place for a peaceful walk with beautiful woodland, nature trails and a wildflower area. Look out for wildlife which includes Green woodpecker, Chiff chaff and Fieldfare as you make your way around the site. The park also contains a popular nine hole golf course, a cafe and a shop. Just to the south east there's also Lightwoods House and Park. Here you'll find an 18th century mansion surrounded by pleasant parkland. In the park there's a walled garden called \"The Shakespeare Garden\" with benches, ponds and flower beds. Just cross the road to the south and you can explore this park too.",
