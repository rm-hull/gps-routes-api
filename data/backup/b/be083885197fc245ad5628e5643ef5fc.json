You can find them on West Way with a postcode of YO61 4TE. The village also includes some fine old buildings including a 15th century castle. In Sheriff Hutton there's The Highwayman. They serve good quality dishes which you can enjoy in the lovely garden area. You can find them on The Square at postcode YO60 6QZ.
