  "description": "This walk visits one of Yorkshire's most interesting historical sites at Mount Grace Priory. The English Heritage owned site is England's most important Carthusian ruin. It dates from the 14th century and includes atmospheric priory ruins, woodland trails and lovely gardens. The route starts in the good sized car park where you can pick up the footpaths around the site. After exploring the ruins you can then enjoy a walk through Mount Grace Wood and down to the 14th century Lady Chapel. Christians have visited this small church, for centuries and continue the tradition through an annual pilgrimage every summer on the Sunday nearest the Feast of the Assumption on the 15th August.  From this peaceful spot there are also excellent views over the Cleveland Plain. The route then heads along Quarry Lane to visit the pretty Cod Beck Reservoir where there is a nice trail along the water. After passing the reservoir you head west towards Swinestye Hill where you can pick up the Cleveland Way National Trail. Follow the waymarked path west and it will take you back to the priory.",
