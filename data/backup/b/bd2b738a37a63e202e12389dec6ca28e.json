  "description": "This walk uses part of the Anglesey Coast Path to explore this expansive sandy bay located on the east coast of Anglesey. The area is an area of outstanding natural beauty with fabulous coastal views and some lovely countryside. There's also lots of pretty pools and eroded rock formations to look out for. This walk starts at the car park at the village of Red Wharf Bay and picks up the coast path to take you around the bay. It's a good path which runs along the beach with the option of climbing into the forest around Mynydd Llwdyiarth. National Cycle Route 5 runs through the village of Pentraeth which is just south of the bay. You can cycle to the village and then head along Lon y traeth to take you down to the bay. To extend your walk you can continue along the coast path to the village of Benllech. This will take you through St David's Park. Here you can try the Benllech to Moelfre Coastal Path which takes you north along a beautiful stretch of coast. If you continue east along the coast you will soon come to Penmon Point. Here you'll find the Trwyn Du Lighthouse and great views towards Puffin Island, Great Orme and Snowdon. There's also nice pebble beaches and seals and dolphins to look out for.",

      "content": "Head to the Ship Inn for some refreshments after your exercise. The lovely pub is located right on the bay with outdoor seats with fine views on summer days. Facing east on the lee side of a hill, it is protected from the prevailing winds and catches the morning and afternoon sun perfectly. Indoors the pub is decked out with all sorts of quaint objects, mostly from old ships. With a good menu and decent selection of ales it's a splendid place to unwind after exploring the area on foot."

      "content": "The large village of Benllech is located very close by and well worth a visit if you have time. Winner of the European Blue Flag award since 2004, the village's beach has an abundance of clean yellow sand and looks out toward the Great Orme and Penmon Point. There's great amenities here with several hotels and eateries to try. To reach the village you can try the Benllech to Red Wharf Bay Walk which runs for just over a mile along the coastal path. Just to the south is Pentraeth Forest where you can enjoy a climb to Mynydd Llwydiarth and look out for the resident red squirrels. Near Moelfre you'll find the noteworthy Mynydd Bodafon, the highest point on the Island of Anglesey. There are great views over the island from the 178 metre high summit. For more walking ideas in the area see the Anglesey Walks page."
