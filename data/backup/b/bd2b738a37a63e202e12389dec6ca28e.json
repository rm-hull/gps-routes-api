  "description": "This walk uses part of the Anglesey Coast Path to explore this expansive sandy bay located on the east coast of\u00a0Anglesey. The area is an area of outstanding natural beauty with fabulous coastal views and some lovely countryside. There's also lots of pretty pools and\u00a0eroded rock formations to look out for. This walk starts at the car park at the village of Red Wharf Bay and picks up the coast path to take you around the bay. It's a good path which runs along the beach with the option of climbing into the forest around Mynydd Llwdyiarth. National Cycle Route 5 runs through the village of Pentraeth which is just south of the bay. You can cycle to the village and then head along Lon y traeth to take you down to the bay. To extend your walk you can continue along the coast path to the village of Benllech. This will take you through St David's Park. Here you can try the Benllech to Moelfre Coastal Path which takes you north along a beautiful stretch of coast. If you continue east along the coast you will soon come to Penmon Point . Here you'll find the Trwyn Du Lighthouse and great views towards Puffin Island, Great Orme and Snowdon. There's also nice pebble beaches and seals and dolphins to look out for.",
