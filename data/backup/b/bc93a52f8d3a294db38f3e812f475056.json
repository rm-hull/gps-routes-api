  "description": "This walk visits the remote Loch Etchachan in the Cairngorms National Park. It's a beautiful, peaceful place with fine views to Cairn Gorm and Ben Macdui. It's popular with both wild swimmers and wild campers. The loch is notable as being the highest waterbody of its size in the UK, the surface being 927 metres (3,041 ft) above sea level. You can easily extend the walk by heading north to visit Loch Avon where there's a circular trail to follow around the loch. To the west there's the climb to Carn Etchachan where you can enjoy fine views over the area.",
