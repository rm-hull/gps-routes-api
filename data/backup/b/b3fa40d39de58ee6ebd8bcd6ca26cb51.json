  "description": "This Surrey town is located near Woldingham and Warlingham in the Tandridge\u00a0district of\u00a0the county. Local walking highlights include the circular Woldingham Countryside Walk which explores the North Downs to the south and east of the town. It additionally visits Botley Hill , the highest point of the Downs. To the west is the Coulsdon South Circular Walk where you can explore the popular Farthing Downs . This walk from the town uses part of the London Loop and the North Downs Way to visit the Gravelly Hill viewpoint,  Happy Valley and Farthing Downs. You can start off from the car park at the Gravelly Hill Caterham viewpoint which lies just to the south of the town. There's some nice trails around the hill and into the surrounding Old Park Wood. You can then follow the North Downs Way north west through the Caterham Valley to Quarry Hangers Nature Reserve, Chaldon, Happy Valley and Farthing Downs where there are some lovely woodland trails and countryside views to enjoy.",
