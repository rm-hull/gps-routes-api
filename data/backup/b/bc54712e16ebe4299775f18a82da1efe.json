  "description": "This Suffolk based village is located in the Stour Valley near Cavendish. Situated atop a hill, the settlement overlooks the rivers Stour and Glem, the latter giving the village its name. It ranks as one of Suffolk's largest villages and has a rich history in the cloth industry, which brought prosperity to many settlements in the Stour valley. Glemsford is home to 48 listed buildings including an historic pub. However, the most notable historic structure is the parish church, dedicated to St Mary. This impressive church is a splendid example of Perpendicular architecture made of flint, featuring a 14th-century west tower. Another remarkable structure is Monk's Hall, a captivating timber-framed hall house with parts dating back to the 15th century. This walk from the village follows a section of the Stour Valley Path through the countryside to visit two historic highlights of the area at Kentwell Hall and Melford Hall, in neighbouring Long Melford. On the way you will cross the River Glem and enjoy some fine views of the local rural scenery. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Glemsford. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
