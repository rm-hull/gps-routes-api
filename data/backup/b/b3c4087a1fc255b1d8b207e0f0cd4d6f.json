  "description": "This walk visits the Abbey Village Reservoir near Abbey Village in Lancashire. The area is very popular with walkers able to enjoy waterside trails, open moorland and peaceful woodland. The walk starts in the village and heads north east to first visit Close House Reservoir which is also known as Abbey Village Reservoir. The reservoir is fed by the River Roddlesworth and is a good place for bird watching with herons and buzzards to look out for. On the eastern side of the water you can then pick up the Witton Weavers Way and follow the waymarked trail south to the visit Roddlesworth Reservoir and Rake Brook Reservoir. The route then passes through the woodland around Tockholes before returning to the village.",
