  "description": "A circular walk exploring the North York Moors around the village of Levisham. The walk visits two of the highlights of the area at the Hole of Horcum and Bridestones. The walk starts at Levisham Station on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. You can catch the heritage railway from the nearby town of Pickering. Follow the country lane north east from the station and you can pick up footpaths up to Dundale Pond on Levisham Moor. Follow the trail across the moor and look out for the Bronze Age barrows and late Iron Age boundary dykes which expose the ancient history of the area. At the top of the path you can take a detour south to visit the Hole of Horcum. This stunning natural amphitheatre was created over thousands of years by a series of landslides caused by water pressure. The moor is great for flora and fauna. Look out for wild flowers, purple heather, deer, grouse, curlew, lapwing, merlin and golden plover as you make your way through the area. The route then picks up the Old Wife's Way and heads south east towards Dalby Forest and the Bridestones. This is another photogenic spot with a series of striking sandstone sculptures dating back to the Jurassic period 150 million years ago. After exploring the Bridestone the route then continues south through the pretty Dove Dale on the edge of Dalby Forest. From here you head west following country lanes and footpaths back to the train station. The first section of this walk uses part of the Tabular Hills Walk. You can extend your walk on this long distance trail which will take you east through Dalby Forest to Wykeham Forest .",

      "content": "On the western side of Levisham Moor you'll find the wonderfully positioned Skelton Tower. The tower dates from 1830 and sits perched high above the moor in a dramatic and picturesque spot. There are great views over Goathland Moor and the steam trains of the North York Moors Railway below. It's a great spot to take some stunning photos. Also to the west is the expansive Cropton Forest and the historic villages of Hutton-le-Hole and Lastingham, where you'll find the excellent Ryedale Folk Museum and the noteworthy 11th century St Mary's church respectively.
