Members can learn to sail on the mere or you can enjoy a walk around the private lake. It's a lovely peaceful place for a stroll with lots of wildlife to see on the water. Keep your eyes peeled for herons, ducks and moorhens on your visit. You can visit the site from Olton train station which lies just to the north. Near here you can also pick up the Grand Union Canal Walk",
