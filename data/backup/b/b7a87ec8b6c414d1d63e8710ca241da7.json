A narrow gauge incline serving Titterstone Quarries also connected with this line at Bitterley and climbed NE for 1\u00bc miles to the incline top 1500ft asl on Titterstone Clee Hill where sidings fanned out to the crushing plant and quarry faces. The photo shows the incline passing over a long distance path 'The Shropshire Way.'"

  "description": "This short climb visits a fine viewpoint in the Clee Hills. The conveniently located public car park makes it a short but rewarding climb with some excellent views to enjoy from the hill summit. You can start the walk from the car park directly the below the hill. From here you can pick up a footpath which snakes up to the hill top passing a former quarry and radar station on the way. It's about a half mile walk to the top, so a mile there and back. The summit stands at a height of 533 metres (1,749 ft) making it the third highest in Shropshire, behind Brown Clee Hill and Stiperstones. Titterstone is well known for providing some of the best views over Britain when the conditions are right. On a clear day you can see Snowdonia, the Peak District, the Black Country, the Cotswolds, the Malvern Hills and the Brecon Beacons of Wales. After taking in the views you descend back to the car park on the same paths.",
