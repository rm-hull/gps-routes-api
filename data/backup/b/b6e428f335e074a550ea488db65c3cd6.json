  "description": "The Tissington trail is a 13 mile off road path following the trackbed of a disused railway line through the stunning Peak District National Park . The trail is shared by walkers and cyclists offering fabulous views of the Derbyshire countryside. It runs from Parsley Hay in the north to Ashbourne in the south. The trail links with the popular High Peak Trail at High Peak Junction. It's a similar rail trail running from Cromford to Dowlow with more great views.
