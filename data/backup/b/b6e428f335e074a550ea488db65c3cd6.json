You can find them at postcode DE6 1LF for your sat navs. The inn is very dog friendly if you have your four legged friend with you. The village itself is also worth exploring with the pretty Bentley Brook and a 14th century church to see. Near Tissington you could take a small detour from the route to visit the worthy village of Parwich where you'll find the noteworthy Sycamore Inn. The limestone inn dates all the way back to the 1600s and is in a lovely spot close to the pretty village green. They serve good quality home cooked food and a fine ranges of ales. You can find them at postcode DE6 1QL for your sat navs. The inn also serves as the village shop so you can pick up various bits and bobs here too."
