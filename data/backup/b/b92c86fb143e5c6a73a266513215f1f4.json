  "description": "Follow the beautiful Somerset coast through the Quantock Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty on this lovely coastal walk. The walk begins at the car park at Steart, next to the wildlife rich Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve Nature Reserve and the Steart Marshes . You then follow the path west, along the coast, to the town of Watchet with its pretty harbour and piers. From Watchet, you continue to Minehead along Blue Anchor Bay and Dunster Beach Nature Reserve. Here you could take a short detour inland and visit Dunster Castle where there is a lovely large deer park. This is an excellent walk for anyone with an interest in geology as local people have uncovered the remains of elk antlers and wild boar tusks on the shores. Fossilised oak and\nyew tree sections are also still visible in places. Also of interest are the views of Flat Holm and Steep Holm Islands which you can visit by boat from Minehead in the summer. On a clear day, there are also good views of the South Wales coast across the Bristol Channel.",
