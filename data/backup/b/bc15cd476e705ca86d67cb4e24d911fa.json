  "description": "Visit this ancient stone and enjoy fabulous views from Cringle Moor on this exhilirating circular walk on the North York Moors. The area is steeped in ancient history with the Three Lords' Stone marked with prehistoric carvings. It forms part of a Bronze Age burial mound with a number of large kerbstones, situated in a captivating area. The route runs for about 3 miles, using good paths with some steep steps up to the high point on Cringle Moor. There's fabulous views, fascinating history and lovely heather moorland to enjoy. You can start the walk from the Lord Stones Cafe car park on the western side of the country park. From here you can pick up the Cleveland Way and follow it east across Cringle Moor, the third highest hill in the North York Moors. After a short distance a path heads off to the left, climbing towards Busby Moor and Dromonby Bank. The path then descends to Kirby Bank where you turn west to climb to the Cringle Moor viewpoint. Here you will find a viewfinder detailing a number of landmarks you can see from the hill. Highlights include the Penshaw Monument, Roseberry Topping, Captain Cook's Monument, Ingleborough Mountain and Whernside. After taking in the views the walk then descends back to the cafe where you can enjoy refreshments in the outdoor seating area. It's easy to extend your walk by continuing east along the Cleveland Way to the Wainstones. Here you'll find a series sandstone rocky outcrops with a number of interesting Bronze Age carvings. Just beyond there is Urra Moor, the highest point on the North York Moors. The long distance Lyke Wake Walk also runs past the stones. The route is a complete crossing of the North Yorkshire Moors from west to east and a great way to explore the area. If you head south west along the Cleveland Way you can visit the lovely Cod Beck Reservoir and the village of Osmotherley .",
