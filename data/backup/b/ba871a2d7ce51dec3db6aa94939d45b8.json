  "description": "Enjoy a cycle or walk around this large lake in the Staffordshire Moorlands near Leek. Cyclists can cycle the whole of the route apart from a section around the north western area where you need to dismount while crossing private property. The route starts and ends at the visitor centre at the southern end of the lake. It follows good paths along the shoreline and through several long woodland sections, making use of the Staffordshire Way along the western side of the water. The lake is a great area for wildlife spotting. Look out for Snipe, Redwind and Goldeneye Drake on the water. If you'd like to continue your exercise then you could head to the nearby Tittesworth Reservoir using the waymarked Staffordshire Moorlands Walks .",
