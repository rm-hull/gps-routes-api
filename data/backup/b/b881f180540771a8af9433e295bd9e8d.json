The notable 11-arch bridge itself dates from the medieval period and is the oldest crossing of the River Great Ouse in Bedfordshire. The village itself is well worth exploring with a 15th century inn and an early 17th century abbey to see."

There's more history too with the building dating back to the 15th century and the inn back to 1624. Inside there's a charming olde worlde interior with a flagstone floor and inglenook fireplace. Outside there's a lovely seating area with views over the river. You can find them on Bridge Street with a postcode of MK43 8ER for your sat navs."
