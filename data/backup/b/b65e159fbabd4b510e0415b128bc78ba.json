  "description": "This walk follows a popular section of the South West Coast Path from Mullion Cove to Kynance Cove and the lighthouse at Lizard Point. It's about a 7 mile walk, following the undulating cliff top path with some fascinating geology, lovely beaches and excellent views along the way. The walk starts at the car park at Mullion Cove, just to the south of the Cornish village of Mullion. It's a very picturesque area with a pretty harbour and an interesting history. From here you can pick up the coastal path and follow it south to the Predannack Cliffs and Kynance Cove. This noteworthy spot is home to some wonderful rock formations and a beautiful beach. You continue south past Pentreath beach before coming to Lizard Point, the most southerly place in Britain. Here you'll find some more splendid sea views and the Lizard Lighthouse guarding the shore.",

Near here there's also the delightful village of Gweek on the Helford River. Here you could try the nature trail at the seal sanctuary where they look after sick and injured seal pups."
