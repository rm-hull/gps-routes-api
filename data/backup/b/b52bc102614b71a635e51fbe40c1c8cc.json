  "description": "This short walk visits Meldon Viaduct in the Dartmoor National Park. You'll pass through the lovely West Okement River Valley, enjoying views of Meldon Reservoir, Meldon Quarry and the remains of old lime kilns on the way. Start the walk from the car park at the northern end of Meldon Reservoir . From here you can follow footpaths north to the viaduct, passing Meldon Pool on the way. Here you can pick up a section of the Granite Way , a shared cycling and walking trail which crosses the viaduct. The structure was opened in 1874 and carried the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) across the West Okement River. It was constructed from wrought iron and cast iron and is now a Scheduled Monument. After passing the viaduct you continue north along the river into a woodland area. Here you can cross the river and return on footpaths on the other side. The final section crosses the wonderful Meldon Dam where there are great views over the reservoir and the surrounding river valley. You can extend your walking in the area by enjoying the trail around Meldon Reservoir or picking up the Dartmoor Way and Two Castles Trail which run to the west of the water. You could follow the trails from the nearby town of Okehampton to the site if you prefer.",
