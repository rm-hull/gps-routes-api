  "description": "Terrington is a delightful village in the Howardian Hills near to Castle Howard. It's a great base for exploring the area which is a designated as an AONB (area of outstanding natural beauty). This circular walk makes use of the Centenary Way and a series of other footpaths to explore the woodland, countryside and hills surrounding the village. There's some fairly gentle ascents with fine views from the high points. It's a peaceful area so look out for a variety of wildlife including Roe Deer in the woodland sections. The walk starts in the centre of the village and heads north to North Carr Hill and Hollin Hill. Here you have the option of exploring the woodland around Hollin Hill which includes Frytons Wood. This route turns south towards Ganthorpe and Mowthorple Dale before returning to the village along Mowthorpe Lane. With various long distance trails passing through the village there's lots of options for extending your walking in the area. You could head south along the Ebor Way and visit the ruined castle and 12th century church at Sheriff Hutton for example. If you were to follow the Centenary Way east and then south you could visit Coneysthorpe and the wonderful Castle Howard. The magnificent house is one of the chief highlights of Howardian Hills. It's great for walkers with 1000 acres of parkland and gardens with woodland trails, two large lakes, a series of ponds, formal gardens and fountains. Also nearby is the town of Malton where there are riverside paths along the River Derwent and a fascinating Roman Fort to see.",

It's an idyllic and appealing place with a historic Saxon Church, a picturesque cricket pitch by the 18th century Hovingham Hall, a pretty beck and two fine hotels to relax in after your exercise. To the south west is Sutton on the Forest where you can visit the 18th-century Georgian English country house of Sutton Park which includes some beautiful landscaped gardens.
