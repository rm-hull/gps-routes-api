  "description": "This attractive market town is located in an ideal spot in the Snowdonia National Park. There's nice trails along the River Conwy, a nearby forest and several beautiful lakes to visit in the area. It's also the home of the wonderful Gwydir Estate which includes a historic castle, an ancient chapel and an expansive forest. This circular walk from the town visits some of the highlights of the area including the River Conwy, Llanrwst Stone Circle, Gwydir Castle, Gwydir Forest, Llyn Parc and the Grey Mare's Tail Waterfall. The route starts on the impressive three arched bridge on the river in the town centre. It is thought to be the work of renowned architect Inigo Jones. From here you can follow a riverside path south to the Gorsedd Stone Circle. The stones were created as part of the 1951 Eisteddfod. This annual event involves eight days of competitions and performances which are considered the largest music and poetry festival in Europe. Near here you will also pass Gwydir Castle . This fortified\u00a0manor house\u00a0dates back to c1500 and includes some beautiful gardens. In the Grade I listed gardens you'll find some ancient\u00a0cedars, one of which was planted in 1625 to commemorate the wedding of King Charles I to Queen\u00a0Henrietta Maria.\u00a0There's also a giant yew tree which is thought to be 600-1000 years old. After passing the castle you continue south along the river before entering Gwydir Forest. Follow the footpaths south through the elevated forest and you will come to Llyn Parc, one of many lakes in the forest. Follow trails north along the lake and then through more woodland and you will come to the Grey Mare's Tail Waterfall. It's a secluded spot with the picturesque falls surrounded by\u00a0the remains of mill buildings and a nature reserve. From the waterfall you head west to visit the Gwydir Uchaf Chapel. The chapel was built in 1673 by Sir Richard Wynn as a family memorial chapel for the Wynns of Gwydir.\u00a0There is a fine interior with a beautifully painted ceiling.\u00a0From here you return to the river which you can follow back into the town.",
