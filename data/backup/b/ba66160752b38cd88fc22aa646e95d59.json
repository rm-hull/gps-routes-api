  "description": "This walk climbs to a distinctive 17th century folly on Pepperbox Hill near Salisbury in Wiltshire. The Grade II listed building dates back to 1606 and is also known as Eyre's Folly. You can start the walk from the Pepperbox Hill car park and then follow footpaths a short way up to the folly. The area is also a nature reserve with lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. You can find the hill just a mile south of the village of West Grimstead. The high point is 157 metres and includes a number of bridle paths for further exploration. From the top there are fine views over the Wiltshire countryside to Salisbury .",
