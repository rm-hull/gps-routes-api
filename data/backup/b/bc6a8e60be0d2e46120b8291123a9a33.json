  "description": "Explore 143 acres of woods, meadows, canals and pools in this pretty country park in Cheddleton , Staffordshire. There are a number of waymarked walking trails and a visitor centre where you can find more details. The site is great for wildlife watching and includes a bird hide where you can look out for the various winged visitors that frequent the park. The park is located next to the Caldon Canal so you could follow the towpath into nearby Cheddleton as an extension of the walk.  The Staffordshire Way also runs just past the park so this is another option if you have time. Our Churnet Valley Walk runs through nearby Cheddleton and is a great way to further explore this lovely area.",
