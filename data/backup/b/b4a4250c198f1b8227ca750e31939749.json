  "description": "A figure of eight circuit around the Warwickshire town of Royal Leamington Spa. The route visits many of the highlights of the area including the River Avon, River Leam, Newbold Comyn Park, Jephson Gardens, Leam Valley Nature Reserve and the Grand Union Canal . It's a great place for a walk with long waterside sections, some lovely countryside and attractive parkland to explore. Starting in the town centre near to the train station, the route heads north to the River Avon where you pick up the riverside path. Follow it west towards Myton where you pick up the Grand Union Canal. You can follow the towpath east towards Offchurch where you turn left onto the Offchurch Greenway shared cycling and walking trail. Follow the trail towards the village which is a popular place for walkers wishing to explore the Warwickshire countryside. You can stop for refreshments at the village pub before continuing your walk. After exploring the village the route heads west through Offchurch Bury Park towards Newbold Comyn Park . The 300 acre park includes the Leam Valley local nature reserve, a Wetland area with a bird hide, woodland, meadow and riverbank habitats. After leaving the park you follow a section of the Warwickshire Centenary Way along the river to return to the town centre. This final section passes the lovely Jephson Gardens which includes a boating lake and Mill Gardens on the other side of the river. The gardens were voted, 'Best Park in Britain 2004' by the Royal Horticultural Society. If you would like to extend your walking in the area then head west along the Centenary Way to the county town of Warwick . Here you can visit the wonderful Warwick Castle and enjoy more riverside and canalside footpaths. Heading east takes you along the canal to Long Itchington . For some nice bluebell woodland trails head to Oakley Wood . Just a few miles to the north east you will find Ryton Pools Country Park where there some lovely waterside cycling and walking trails to try. The long distance Shakespeare's Avon Way also passes through the town and is a great way of exploring the Warickshire countryside.",
