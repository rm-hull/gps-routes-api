  "description": "Enjoy wonderful views of the city of Bath on this popular circular walk. The walk has been devised by the National Trust so takes place on waymarked, well maintained footpaths. The walk begins on Bathwick Hill and then heads south to Widcombe passing Smallcombe Wood. The wood is an excellent place for birdwatching with nuthatch, wrens and blackcap to look out for. The route continues past the stunning Prior Park with its beautiful lakes and Palladian Bridge. You then cross Claverton Down before turning north towards Claverton where you will find the excellent American musuem. The path continues north towards Bathampton where there is a nice woodland section through Bathampton Woods. You then turn south through more woodland to Sham Castle, an 18th-century folly which makes a good spot to rest and enjoy the wonderful views. The final section takes you from the castle to Bathwick Hill and the finish point. It's a splendid walk with varied scenery and consistently wonderful views over Bath towards the Mendip Hills. At Bathampton you can pick up the Kennet and Avon Canal and try the Bath to Bradford Upon Avon Canal Walk. The route will take you from Somerset into Wiltshire along the towpath of the canal.",
