  "description": "This Oxfordshire village is surrounded by several large areas of woodland and some lovely Chilterns countryside. There's also a nearby nature reserve and a fine National Trust property within walking distance. This circular walk uses a mixture of country lanes, bridleways, public footpaths and a section of the Oxfordshire Way to explore the area to the south of the village. On the way you'll visit Warburg Nature Reserve, the village of Middle Assendon, the historic Greys Court and Nettlebed Woods. The walk starts from the village and follows trails north east to the Warburg Nature Reserve. There's some nice nature trails here with lots of bluebells and wood anemones in the spring moths. Also keep your eyes peeled for a variety of woodland birds. At the eastern end of the reserve you can pick up the Oxfordshire Way and follow the waymarked footpath to Middle Assendon. There's a nice pub here if you'd like to make a pit stop on the walk. From the village you head south west past Bix Common and Lambridge Wood. You could take a small detour from the route to explore the woods. The large beechwood stretches from the northwest end of Henley towards the village of Bix. This walk continues south west to visit Greys Court. This National Trust owned property includes woodland trails, beautiful gardens, a turf maze, a photogenic Chinese Bridge and a 19th century ice house. After exploring the estate the route heads north through Shepherd's Green to Nettlebed Woods. You can follow trails north through the woods to Castslip and Crocker End before returning to the village.",

In the town you can also pick up the Henley via Stonor Circular Walk which also visits Greys Court and the scenic deer park at Stonor Park. Another nice option is to head to the noteworthy village of Turville and visit the famous Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Windmill. You can follow the long distance Chiltern Way from the Warburg Nature Reserve north east to Turville and its near neighbour of Fingest.  Just south is the worthy village of Stoke Row where there are some interesting historical features. The village includes the distinctive Maharajah's Well, a pretty cherry orchard and a noteworthy 17th century pub reputed to be the former haunt of notorious highwayman Dick Turpin. Near here there's also Ipsden where you can explore the trails on Ipsden Heath and visit the 12th century Norman church. For more walking ideas in the area see the Chilterns Walks page."
