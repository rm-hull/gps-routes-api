  "description": "This walk takes you around Tranwell Woods and the old Tranwell Airfield near Morpeth . The woods are located just south of the town, with some nice country lanes and footpaths around the Gubeon Woodland Plantation. The golf centre and the World War II airfield are adjacent to the site. The area is also known for its million pound properties, being one of the most exclusive estates in the North East. To continue your walking in the area head north and pick up the Morpeth Walk where you can enjoy a pleasant waterside stroll along the Wansbeck River. Scroll down for more walks in and around the village.",
