    "description": "Explore miles of cycling and walking trails in this large area of ancient woodland near Shaftesbury . The woods cover 93 hectares (230 acres) with waymarked trails and lots of pretty bluebells in the spring months. There's also a nice climb to Duncliffe Hill with great views of Blackmore Vale to enjoy. Look out for a variety of woodland birds and butterflies including silver-washed fritillary, white admiral and purple hairstreak. To continue your walking in the area you could head a few miles south east to the Cranborne Chase AONB and visit the lovely Fontmell and Melbury Downs at Compton Abbas . The area is a nature reserve with a variety of interesting flora and fauna. There's also a climb to Melbury Hill where there are great views over the Vale of Wardour and Shaftesbury. The Hardy Way long distance trail also passes through the woods. You could follow the trail from Shaftesbury to the woods or head south west to Marnhull. Here you can pick up the Stour Valley Way and further explore this lovely area.",
