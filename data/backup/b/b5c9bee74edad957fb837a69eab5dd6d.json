The hill stands at 330 metres above sea level and about 60 metres above the surrounding countryside. The church on the top dates from around the 13th century although human activity is known to go back to an Iron Age fort on the hill. There are great views from the top."

  "description": "Enjoy a short climb to this distinctive Dartmoor Hill and visit the historic hill top Church of St Michael, the parish church of the village of Brentor, which lies below the Tor. You can start the walk from the Church car park just to the west of the hill. From here you can pick up footpaths taking you up to the hill summit and the church. It's a short climb, taking place on a grassy path with some stone steps as you approach the summit. From the hill top there are wonderful views across the surrounding countryside of Devon. The Church of St Michel de Rupe (Saint Michael of the Rock') atop the Tor dates to the 13th century. The ancient church is still used on Christmas Day, Easter Day and for Evensong during the summer. The hill is located just a short distance from Mary Tavy. Here you can pick up two long distance trails to further explore Dartmoor. You can follow the West Devon Way and the Dartmoor Way north to visit the splendid Lydford Gorge .",
