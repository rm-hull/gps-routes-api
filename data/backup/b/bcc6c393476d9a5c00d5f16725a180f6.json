  "description": "This walk follows the opening section of the Fife Coastal Path from Kincardine To Culross. The route runs for just over 4 miles following the fairly flat waymarked path east from Kincardine. On the way you will pass the Longannet Mines, Blair Castle and Dunimarle Castle before coming to Culross. Here you can visit the historic Culross Palace and Culross Abbey. The last section includes some lovely views over the Forth Estuary to Grangemouth. Culross is well worth exploring with historic National Trust owned sites, white-harled houses with red-tiled roofs, steep cobbled streets, ancient abbey ruins and the ochre-coloured palace with its beautifully reconstructed period garden. The route also follows National Cycle Route 76 along a roadside cycle path so it also suitable for cyclists. For the next section of the walk see the Culross To Limekilns Walk page. This will take you east to the nearby Torry Bay Nature Reserve where you can look out for a wide variety of wildlife.",
