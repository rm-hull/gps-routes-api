  "description": "This Essex town is located in the Epping Forest District of the county. It's an attractive town with dozens of historic listed buildings and three conservation areas. This circular walk from Loughton tube station visits some of the walking highlights of the area including Epping Forest , Connaught Water and Hainault Forest Country Park . The route uses some of the long distance walking trails that run through the area including the Epping Forest Centenary Walk , the London Loop , and the Three Forests Way . These waymarked trails are a great way of further exploring the area. Just to the south of the town you will pass the Roding Valley Meadows nature reserve on the River Roding near neighbouring Chigwell . There's some pleasant waterside trails here with lots of wildlife to see. To extend the walk head a little further to the north and pick up the Theydon Bois Oak Trail .",
