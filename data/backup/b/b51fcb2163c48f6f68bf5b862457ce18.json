  "description": "Enjoy miles of woodland and moorland paths at Havant Thicket, part of the Forest of Bere. You can park at the south eastern corner of the woods, near Rowlands Castle. Then follow the trails through the woods where you can visit the ponds and look out for wildlife including various woodland birds and deer. To further explore the forest head west to Creech Woods near Denmead and West Walk where there's more nice waymarked trails to try. Just to the south of thicket you will find Staunton Country Park where there's a farm, two pretty lakes, a maze, a walled garden and glasshouses containing exotic tropical flowers and plants from around the world. To the east of Rowlands Castle you will find Stansted Park where you will find a fine 1800 acre park surrounding the Edwardian Stansted House. The Rowlands Castle Walk visits the house before heading to the thicket and Staunton Country Park. It starts at the train station in the village and is a nice way of seeing all of these local attractions in one loop.",
