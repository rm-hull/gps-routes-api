  "description": "Explore the parkland and countryside surrounding this Elizabethan\u00a0country house in Padiham Greenway . The circular trail includes riverside paths along the River Calder and some nice woodland trails as well. The historic estate includes lovely gardens, a number of old listed buildings and a 17th century Great Hall. Inside there's wonderful exhibitions including the North West\u2019s largest collection of portraits on loan from the National Portrait Gallery. The walk starts at the hall and heads along the Calder before crossing to the other side on a bridge. On the northern side you pick up the Burnley Way which will take you along a waymarked path through the Grove Lane Plantation to Hunters Oak. Here you cross the river again and follow a footpath through Hagg Wood before returning to the hall.",
