  "description": "This pretty little hamlet sits in a pleasant location on the slopes of Leith Hill in Surrey. It's a popular place to start a walk with a car park, a mill pond, river views, a Georgian country house estate, a waterfall and lots of trails branching out in all directions. There's also a nearby pub for some rest and refreshment after your walk. This circular walk starts from the car park and takes you around the hamlet and the pond before heading north to another pond on the Wotton House Estate. You'll then head north to Wotton House which dates back to the early 17th century. There's also views of the River Tillingbourne which flows through the estate. The route continues through Wotton where you can pick up the Greensand Way and follow it south to Home Farm. This section passes the picturesque Tillingbourne waterfall. At Home Farm you then turn west to return to the car park. It's easy to extend your walk by further exploring Abinger Common or climbing to the nearby Abinger Roughs which lies just to the north.",
