  "description": "Follow the River Tees from Dufton , in Cumbria, to Redcar on the North Yorkshire coast. The first section takes you through the Pennine Hills, from Dufton to Forest-in-Teesdale. There is some spectacular scenery as you pass through Dufton Fell and then past Cow Green Reservoir before joining the River Tees near the village of Forest-in-Teesdale. This section is coincident with the Pennine Way National Trail and includes several beautiful waterfalls as shown in the video below. From Forest-in-Teesdale you continue along the river passing Newbiggin, Middleton in Teesdale and Egglesdon Hall on your way to Barnard Castle . Here you will find two fascinating historical buildings in the 12th century Barnard castle and the ruined abbey at nearby Egglestone. You can also try our Teesdale Way Circular Walk here which runs along both sides of the river from the castle to the villages of Egglestone, Romaldkirk and Cotherstone. The next section runs from Barnard Castle to Darlington. This section very closely follows the banks of the River Tees, passing Whorlton and the interesting Roman Fort at Piercebridge on the way. From Darlington you continue east towards Stockton-on-Tees. This section takes you past Teesside Airport and the pretty town of Yarm . The final section takes you through the industrial landscape of Stockton on Tees and Middlesbrough , passing the impressive Infinity Bridge, and the Tees Barrage . You then pass Middlesbrough Docks and the Riverside Stadium before finishing on the outskirts of Redcar.",
