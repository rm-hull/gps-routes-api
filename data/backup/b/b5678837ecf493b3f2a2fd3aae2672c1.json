  "description": "The coast path between Ilfracombe and Woolacombe runs for about 8 miles along a series of dramatic cliffs, beautiful bays and lovely beaches. The walk starts on the front in Ilfracombe and climbs to Capstone Point and Capstone Hill. It's a fairly challenging start to the walk but with great views across the town and harbour as your reward. The path continues west past The Outfalls to The Torrs Park Local Nature Reserve. There's a great zig-zag path and views all the way to Exmoor from the high points here. The next stage runs past Freshwater Bay and the small village of Lee. The village lies at the foot of what is known locally as the Fuchsia Valley, and consists of around 100 properties, mostly old in style. There's a beach at Lee Bay accessible from the coastal path via a National Trust-maintained path and staircase down the cliff face. The next stage takes you up to the Bull Point Lighthouse before heading along Rockham Bay to Morte Point. This splendid peninsula has some fascinating rock formations and great views towards Lundy Island. It's owned by the National Trust so there are good paths to follow across the headland. The area is also great for wildlife with Atlantic grey seals to look out for in the waters below. The final stage takes you into the popular seaside resort of Woolacombe. Here you will find a 3 mile long sandy beach recognised as one of the best beaches in Europe. To extend your walking in the area you could try our Mortehoe Circular Walk which starts from the village car park in Mortehoe. You could also continue south along the South West Coast Path on the Woolacombe to Croyde Walk. This will take you to Baggy Point and the sand dunes of Woolacombe Warren.",

      "content": "The circular Ilfracombe to Lee Bay Walk heads along the same section of coast to Lee Bay before using the old Ilfracombe to Ossaborough Railway Path to return to Ilfracombe. It also visits the woodland trails in the Borough Valley between Lee and Ossaborough. From Ilfracombe you can catch a boat to the beautiful Lundy Island. The island is owned by the National Trust and has some splendid coastal walking trails. It's also a nature reserve with lots of wildlife to see, including the famous Lundy puffins. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
