  "description": "The town of Seaham is located on the Durham Coast, just south of Sunderland. This walk follows a section of the Durham Coastal Footpath from the town to nearby Peterlee and the Castle Eden Dene Nature Reserve. It's about a 7 mile walk along a reasonably flat path with fine sea views for the duration of the route. The walk starts on the harbour in Seaham where you can pick up the waymarked footpath. Follow it south and it will take you past Chourdon Point, Shippersea Bay and the Easington Colliery. This section also passes Hawthorn Dene. You could take a detour from the route to visit the nature reserve which includes attractive woodland and the pretty Hawthorn Burn. The next stage takes you past the waterfall at Fox Holes Dene before coming to Horden Point and Hartlepool Point, where the route finishes. If you head west from here you can visit the Castle Eden Dene Nature Reserve. Here you'll find woodland trails, pretty streams, rushing waterfalls and plenty of wildlife to look out for.",

You could also continue south along the coastal path all the way to Hartlepool. Head a few miles west and there's Hetton Lyons Country Park to explore. There's a fine lakeside cycling and walking trail here with good facilities including watersports and a cafe. On the western side of the reserve you can pick up National Cycle Route 14 and the Haswell to Hart Countryside Walkway. The multi-user trail uses the trackbed of a disused railway line to travel between the two old stations."
