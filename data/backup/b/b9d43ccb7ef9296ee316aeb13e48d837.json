  "description": "This attractive Essex based town is a very pleasant place for a stroll. There's a number of historic half timbered houses, a 14th century Guildhall, 16th century almshouses and a picturesque windmill to admire. There's also a series of good countryside footpaths with scenic views of the River Chelmer to enjoy in the surrounding area. This walk from the town follows a section of the Harcamlow Way south to Dutton Hill and the remains of the abbey and mill at Tilty. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Harcamlow Way and follow the waymarked footpath south towards the windmill. You continue past Stanbrook and Follymill before coming to Dutton Hill and Tilty. Here you can enjoy views of the old Tilty mill and the ruins of Tilty Abbey which dates back to the 12th century.",

      "content": "On the northern side of the town you can pick up the circular Turpin's Trail. The waymarked paths will take you to nearby Great Sampford and Hempstead, the birthplace of Highwayman Dick Turpin. If you follow the Harcamlow Way north west you could visit Saffron Walden and the splendid Audley End park. The long distance Icknield Way Path and the Saffron Trail can also be picked up in this area. To the south there's the expansive Hatfield Forest, Great Dunmow and the Flitch Way, a shared cycling and walking trail along a disused railway line. A few miles to the west you'll find Clavering where there's a noteworthy 14th century church and some delightful almshouses dating back to the 15th century. You'll also pass picturesque Arkesden which is well worth exploring.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Essex Walks page."
