  "description": "Explore this 165 acre country park in Brampton, and enjoy the large glacial tarn, mature woodland and gentle meadows with the stunning Pennine Hills as a backdrop. The park includes a well maintained path around the tarn and three other way-marked trails taking you through the surrounding woodland and fields. Facilities include a tearoom, gift shop and row boats available for hire on the tarn. Just a mile to the west you will find Gelt Woods . This is a great place to extend your walk with nice footpaths along the River Gelt and lots of wildlife to look out for in the RSPB reserve.",
