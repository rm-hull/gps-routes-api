The park includes a well maintained path around the tarn and three other way-marked trails taking you through the surrounding woodland and fields. Facilities include a tearoom, gift shop and row boats available for hire on the tarn. Just a mile to the west you will find Gelt Woods. This is a great place to extend your walk with nice footpaths along the River Gelt and lots of wildlife to look out for in the RSPB reserve.",

      "content": "Head a couple of miles south of the park and you'll find another nice waterside walk around Castle Carrock Reservoir. It's a lovely and peaceful area with the associated village of Castle Carrock also worth a visit. The circular Brampton Walk visits the park from the train station located just to the north east. It also goes on to explore Gelt Woods. You can catch trains to Brampton station from Carlisle and Newcastle. Just a couple of miles to the north east of Brampton there's Miltonrigg Woods to explore. There's more peaceful woodland trails here with pretty bluebells in the spring and lots wildlife to see. Lanercost Priory is also located in this area. The English heritage run site was originally founded in 1169 as an Augustinian monastery. Today the substantial priory ruins are well worth a visit for the fascinating history and architecure.A few miles to the south west you'll find the worthy village of Wetheral where you can visit a historic ruined priory, the River Eden and the National Trust's Wetheral Woods. Near here there's also the Wreay Woods Nature Reserve where you can look out for otters by the River Petteril. Just to the east there's Geltsdale. Here you'll find a rugged RSPB nature reserve with becks, hills, old quarries, a pretty tarn and lots of wildlife to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the North Pennines Walks and Cumbria Walks pages."
