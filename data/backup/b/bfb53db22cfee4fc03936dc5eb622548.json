  "description": "This pretty Cotswolds village is located in a pleasant spot on the River Coln. There's also a noteworthy Norman Church and an 16th century inn to visit in the settlement. This circular walk takes you around the village, visiting the Old Mill House, the River Coln and the neighbouring village of Quenington. There's nice views of the river and some lovely Cotswolds countryside to enjoy on the way.",
