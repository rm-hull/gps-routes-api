  "description": "This walk visits Waugh's Well in the Rossendale Valley area of Lancashire. The structure was created to commemorate\u00a0local poet Edwin Waugh who is known locally as \"the Lancashire Burns\". It is located at Foe Edge Farm, on the moors above\u00a0Edenfield, where he spent much time writing. Scout Moor High Level Reservoir is also located next to the well. As such it is a splendid place for a walk with fantastic views over the area from the elevated position. This circular walk uses sections of the Pennine Bridleway and the Rossendale Way to visit the well from Waterfoot. The route then goes on to explore the moorland scenery, visiting Cowpe Reservoir before descending back to Hugh Mill and Waterfoot.
