The grotto, cascade and hermit's cave were all added later when the Picturesque landscape became fashionable. The cascade was designed around 1785 by Charles Hamilton, based on the one he designed for his own Painshill Park. The cascade has been used several times as a TV location, including the BBC 'Robin of Sherwood' series. With several paths and tunnels, the grotto makes a good place for the kids to have fun."

  "description": "This Georgian country house is located on the edge of the North Wessex Downs, near the Wiltshire town of Calne. It's surrounded by lovely parkland with some nice walking trails to follow through woodland and to the large lake. In the park you will also find English landscape gardens designed by Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown. The house itself was designed by Robert Adam in the 18th Century. Highlights include the Italianate terrace gardens, the Doric Temple folly, waterfalls, sculptures and the rhododendron walks. Access to the house and gardens requires a fee but there are also public footpaths running through Bowood Park and along part of the lake. You can follow these from the nearby town of Calne to the park. To continue your walking in the area head into Calne and pick up the Chippenham to Calne Railway Path. The shared cycling and walking trail includes lovely riverside sections along the River Avon and the River Marden. If you head a few miles west of the house you could visit Lacock Abbey and Village. It's a fascinating area with nice walks along the River Avon and the woodland in the abbey grounds.",
