  "description": "This walk explores Clanger and Picket Wood near Heywood and Trowbridge in Wiltshire. The 59 hectare (145 acre) woods include some easy footpaths taking you around the site. The woods are particularly lovely in spring when there are carpets of bluebells to see. Also look out for a variety of woodland birds including the nuthatch, treecreeper and willow warbler. In the summer months look out for butterflies that include the Silver-washed fritillary and the White Admiral. You can start your walk from the car park on the western side of the woods, just off the Westbury Road at a postcode of BA13 4LL for your sat navs. From here you can pick up the trails heading east across the site, with the option of following another footpath north to visit the little village of Yarnbrook.",

      "content": "Head north into Trowbridge and you could try the Trowbridge Park and River Walk. Near here there's also the delightful village of Holt where there are two historic National Trust properties with beautiful gardens. Just a couple of miles to the west you'll find Southwick Country Park. The 100 acre park has a series of good walking trails to try. Just to the south you can enjoy a climb to the Westbury White Horse and enjoy fine views over the area. You can also pick up the Wessex Ridgeway and White Horse Trail from this elevated position. If you head south to Westbury you can pick up the Imber Range Perimeter Path. The circular route takes you around the MOD's Imber Range on Salisbury Plain. It includes a climb to the Battlesbury Hill Iron Age fort where there are some excellent views over the region. For more walking ideas in the area see the Wiltshire Walks page."
