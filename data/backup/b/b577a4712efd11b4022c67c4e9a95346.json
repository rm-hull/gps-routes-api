  "description": "This circular walk visits the historic Aydon Castle before exploring the surrounding countryside on a series of footpaths and country lanes. The site is located near Corbridge and includes a fine 13th century English manor house surrounded by peaceful woodland. The house was built by Robert de Reymes, a wealthy Suffolk merchant, in 1296, adjacent to the steep valley of the Cor Burn. You can enjoy a stroll around the castle grounds and the pretty walled orchard before heading through the countryside to the village of Aydon. The walk then follows country lanes back to the Cor Burn bridge before returning to the castle. The site is located just to the south of the epic Hadrian's Wall Path. To extend your walk you could pick up the trail and head west toward Chollerford. Just to the south you can try our Hexham to Corbridge Walk where you can enjoy views of the River Tyne, a visit to the fascinating Corbridge Roman site and some nice woodland trails.",
