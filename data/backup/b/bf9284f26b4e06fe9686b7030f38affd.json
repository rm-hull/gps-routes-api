  "description": "Located at the eastern end of Mersea Island this super country park is perfect for an easy coastal walk. You can stroll along the lovely sandy beach and enjoy views across Mersea Island and Brightlingsea Reach towards Brightlingsea. There's also marshland and grassland which is perfect for picnics. The circular walk below starts at the car park and follows the beach for about a mile before returning through the countryside on a mixture of walking paths and country lanes. On the way look out for the 16th century fort and a large variety of coastal wildlife. The park is located about 7 miles south of Colchester .",
