  "description": "This walk takes you to a series of reservoirs in the Calderdale area of West Yorkshire. On the route there's lovely views across the picturesque lakes to the heather moors and rolling hills beyond. The walk starts from the public car park at Blackstone Edge. From here you can pick up a section of the Pennine Way and follow it north to Blackstone Edge Reservoir, White Holme Reservoir, Light Hazzles Reservoir and Warlands Reservoir. You can then follow a footpath around Warland Reservoir before returning on the same paths. If you head just a mile north of the lake you could visit the pretty Gaddings Dam. The small reservoir is notable for having the highest beach in Britain.",

      "content": "Head north east and you can visit Withens Clough Reservoir and the interesting little village of Cragg Vale. The climb to the gritstone escarpment of Blackstone Edge also starts from the reservoir car park. There are wonderful views over Greater Manchester and Yorkshire from the elevated position of the Edge. The circular Centenary Walk around Todmorden passes along the western side of the reservoir. The long distance trail explores the area around the town. Just to the west of Todmorden there's also some nice peaceful trails around the woodland of Gorpley Clough and the adjacent Gorpley Reservoir.  For more walking ideas in the area see the South Pennines Walks page."
