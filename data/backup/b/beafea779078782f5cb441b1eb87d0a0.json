      "content": "The Red Lion - Constructed from local stone around the turn of the 18th century, this well-loved, family-operated village pub features a quaint, old-world bar and a traditional inglenook fireplace, with a restaurant nearby. The bar extends to an additional lounge dining area. They offer homemade food daily, except on Mondays and Tuesdays. A spacious beer garden with Roman-style seating is available for guests. Patrons are recommended to call ahead to reserve a table, particularly on Sundays, due to the popularity of the food and potential changes in opening hours or days. Interestingly, the building that now houses the toilets once served as a fish and chip shop. The pub can be found on Peterborough Road at postcode PE8 6TN for sat navs. They are dog friendly."
