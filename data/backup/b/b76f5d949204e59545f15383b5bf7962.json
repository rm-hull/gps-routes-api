  "description": "This walk runs from Lymm to Runcorn, following the Bridgewater canal for much of the route. The trail starts off on the canal at Spud Wood just outside Lymm. You then head through the pretty town and around Lymm Dam before rejoining the Bridgewater Canal to Appleton Park where the trail takes you alongside Appleton Reservoir. A couple of pleasant woodland sections take you to Daresbury with the final leg passing through Runcorn and finishing on Runcorn Hill.",
