  "description": "This picturesque Quantocks village has some nice country and woodland trails to the west and south of the settlement. The village itself is also a very pleasant place for a stroll with delightful cottages, a pretty stream and an old castle to visit. This walk in the village visits Coleridge Cottage and Stowey Castle. The walk starts from Coleridge Cottage on Lime Street in the village centre. The historic cottage was formerly the home of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge during the late 18th century. The site is now run by the National Trust so you can enjoy a tour of the house and learn all about the life of the famous writer. It was during his three years here that he wrote his finest works, including 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', 'Kubla Khan', 'Frost at Midnight', 'Christabel' and 'This Lime Tree Bower my Prison'. After exploring the cottage you can follow lanes and footpaths west to visit the remains of Stowey Castle. The castle was a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, built in the 11th century. It is now designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument with public footpaths you can follow around the elevated site.",

      "content": "The Coleridge Way starts in the village. The waymarked trail follows in his footsteps, taking you to the nearby Holford and Combe Sydenham Country Park. Head a few miles north to the coast and you could explore Kilve Beach and East Quantoxhead. The beach is a great place for fossil hunting and walks along the cliff top path. There's also a lovely cafe for cream teas and a 17th century coaching inn in Kilve village. Near the village you'll find the worthy settlement of Crowcombe where you can enjoy the circular walk to Black Hill, Bicknoller Hill and the 15th century Halsway Manor. The village additionally includes a fine 17th century pub with a lovely large garden and views to the Brendon Hills. For more walking ideas in the area see the Quantocks Walks page."
