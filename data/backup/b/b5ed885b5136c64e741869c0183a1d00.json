  "description": "This picturesque Quantocks village has some nice country and woodland trails to the west and south of the settlement. The village itself is also a very pleasant place for a stroll with delightful cottages, a pretty stream and an old castle to visit. This walk in the village visits Coleridge Cottage and Stowey Castle. The walk starts from Coleridge Cottage on Lime Street in the village centre. The historic cottage was formerly the home of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge during the late 18th century. The site is now run by the National Trust so you can enjoy a tour of the house and learn all about the life of the famous writer. It was during his three years here that he wrote his finest works, including 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', 'Kubla Khan', 'Frost at Midnight', 'Christabel' and 'This Lime Tree Bower my Prison'. After exploring the cottage you can follow lanes and footpaths west to visit the remains of Stowey Castle. The castle was\u00a0a\u00a0Norman\u00a0motte-and-bailey\u00a0castle, built in the 11th century. It is now designated as a\u00a0Scheduled Ancient Monument with public footpaths you can follow around the elevated site.",
