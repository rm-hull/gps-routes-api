  "description": "A lovely coastal walk along a section of the Cleveland Way National Trail between Saltburn and Whitby. It's a stunning area with bracing cliff tops paths, lovely beaches and a series of pretty villages. The walk starts in Saltburn, passing the pretty Saltburn Valley Gardens where there's beautiful formal gardens, woodland and fine views of the ocean. You continue east towards Skinningrove, passing the attractive Cattersty Sands on the way. The path continues to the village of Boulby where there are some of the highest cliffs in England, at 203 metres (666 ft) above sea level. The next stage takes you to the village of Staithes. It's a popular tourist destination with its sheltered harbour, high cliffs and pretty cottages. Here you'll also find Cowbar Nab with it's huge seabird colony including Kittiwake, Fulmar and Razorbill. You continue along the coast to Port Mulgrave and Runswick Bay. This fishing village is another highlight of the Yorkshire coast with its sandy beach, sheltered bay and pretty little cottages. The white thatched property on the seafront is the only remaining thatched house on the Yorkshire coast. The final section takes you past the moonscape quarry at Sandsend Ness before passing along Whitby Sands and finishing at Whitby. To extend your exercise you could try the Whitby to Robin's Hood Bay Walk and visit the ruined Whitby Abbey and the picturesque fishing village of Robin's Hood Bay. You could head north west on the Redcar to Saltburn Beach Walk and visit the nearby village of Marske.",
