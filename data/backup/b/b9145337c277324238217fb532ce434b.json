  "description": "This coastal walk from Folkestone takes you to three of the area's country parks. The walk starts on the front at Lower Leas Coastal Park. The park includes a number of interesting features including imposing cliffs, interesting rock formations, an amphitheatre, a great zig-zag path, wildflower meadows and lots in intersting plants and flowers. From the park you head east past the Harbour Pier, the Martello Tower and Dover Hill, where you pick up the Saxon Shore Way. Continue east and it will take you to East Cliff and Warren Country Park. In the park there's some wonderful coastal views, spectacular cliffs, interesting flora and fauna and three old Martello Towers to see. These were built on the east cliffs in the early 19th century to protect against the French invasion of Napoleon. The route continues east along Tunnel Abbot's Cliff to Samphire Hoe Country Park. From the park there are fabulous views of the stunning Shakespeare Cliff and the Strait of Dover. The park is also a designated Nature Reserve with a huge variety of wildlife and  a number of nationally rare plant species including the Early Spider Orchid. To continue your walking in the area head east to Dover and visit the fascinating Dover Castle. Near here you can also pick up our circular Dover Cliffs Walk which will take you along the famous White Cliffs.",
