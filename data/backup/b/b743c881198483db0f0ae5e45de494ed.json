  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside around the Herefordshire village of Woolhope. The waymarked trail runs for about 6 miles using local public footpaths and country lanes. On the way there are some moderate hill climbs with some pleasant views over the surrounding area to enjoy. The route also passes the Wessington Pasture nature reserve which includes several very large ancient hazel trees. The northern section of the walk runs very close to Broadmoor Common and Haugh Woods. You could extend your walk along the pleasant woodland paths in the expansive woods. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Woolhope. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
