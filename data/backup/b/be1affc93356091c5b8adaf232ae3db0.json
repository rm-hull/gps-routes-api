Plots of land were sold cheaply to families mainly from East London for holiday homes. The deeds did not permit occupancy for a full twelve months of the year. This was ignored during WW2, after the war the council decided that it would cost far to much to bring the infrastructure up to modern standards so people were moved into the new town of Basildon. The last few houses being compulsorily purchased. The area was designated as a recreational area. 30 years ago the area was handed to the Essex Wildlife Trust. The haven is now preserved as it was in the 1940's."
