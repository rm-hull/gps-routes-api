  "description": "This attractive Hertfordshire based village is located just north of Hitchin on the west bank of the River Hiz. The rural settlement has a number of nice local shops and several historic pubs for post walk refreshments. There's also an interesting old church with 12th century Norman features and several fine pubs for rest and refreshment after your exercise. It is also located on a significant long distance walking trail. This circular walk from the village uses part of the Icknield Way Path to visit Oughtonhead Common Nature Reserve and the neighbouring village of Pirton. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it west to Westmill Lane. Turn south at Westmill Farm and it will take you to the Oughtonhead Common. Here you'll find some nice trails along the River Oughton with lots of wildlife to look out for. After exploring the common retrace your steps to Westmill Farm and then head north west along the Icknield Way. The trail will take you to the pretty village of Pirton. The route then heads east along the Hambridge Way track which will lead you back towards Ickleford. For more information about the history and arichitecture in the village see the wikipedia entry.",
