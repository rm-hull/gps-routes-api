  "description": "This Staffordshire based market town has some nice canal side walks to try. There's also a wooded National Trust property and some beautiful gardens to visit nearby. This walk from the town takes you along the Trent and Mersey Canal to nearby Trentham where you can visit the splendid Trentham Gardens. The walk starts in Stone next to the canal, just to the west of the train station. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it north to Barlaston, Trentham Lock and Trentham. You then leave the canal and follow footpaths west through Trentham and along the Longton Brook. On the western side of the town you will come to Trentham Gardens where there are some lovely footpaths around the lake.  Other highlights in the park include a Floral Labyrinth, Secret Garden, Japanese Garden and Italian Gardens. After exploring the gardens the route returns to Stone on the same paths.",
