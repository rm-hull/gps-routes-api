  "description": "This walk from Wilmslow visits the popular Carrs Park before following the River Bollin to the nearby Styal Country Park and Woods. It's a pretty area with riverside footpaths, woodland trails and old mills to see on the way. The walk to Styal Park is about 2 miles so it's a 4 mile round trip, taking place on a fairly flat trail. The walk starts just to the west of the train station where you can pick up paths leading into Carrs Park. This public park was opened in 1935 and covers 70 acres with nice riverside footpaths. After passing through the park the footpaths bend round to the north to take you to Styal Country Park and the National Trust's Quarry Bank Mill. This industrial heritage site is a wonderful place for a stroll with a fascinating history stretching back hundreds of years. It's the home to Samuel Greg's 18th century cotton mill which was powered by the water of the river Bollin. You can tour the mill and find out how it operated and the global cotton trade of the time. Also nearby is Styal village where you can see the old worker cottages and find out about how they lived and worked. The estate includes woodland and picturesque gardens too it is a great place for an easy stroll. After exploring the site you return to the town centre on the same paths. The waymarked North Cheshire Way and the Bollin Valley Way pass through the town. These long distance footpaths are both fine ways of further exploring the area. Also nearby is the historic town of Knutsford which includes the splendid Tatton Park .",
