  "description": "This large forest is located near Peebles and Innerleithen in the Scottish Borders. The conifer woodland is popular with walkers and mountain bikers with a number of trails to try. You can start off from the parking area at the northern edge of the forest, a few miles south east of Peebles. Head south towards the Iron Age Hillfort at Castle Knowe and Wallace's Hill. At the southern side of the forest there is also some pleasant heather moorland to explore. The Gypsy Glen Walk passes the edge of the forest. You could pick up the trail and climb to Kirkhope Law for some fine views over the area. The Tweed Valley Railway Path also runs past the eastern side.",
