  "description": "This tranquil lake in the North Downs has a pleasant circular walkway and surrounding woodland trails. You can start your walk from the parking area just off the A25, a few miles east of Guildford. The pool is a popular destination with an eerie stillness and folklore tales. It is said King John on his horse abducted a woodcutter's daughter who was forced into the deep water and drowned. If you'd like to extend your walk you can follow the woodland trail north from the pool and link up with the North Downs Way. You could then continue to the nearby Newlands Corner. Albury Park is also nearby and is also great for walking. The Fox Way long distance circular trail visits the Albury Estate and the Silent Pool. It will take you on a tour of the countryside, woodland and canals surrounding Guildford .",
