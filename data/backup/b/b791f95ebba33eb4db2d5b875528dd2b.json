  "description": "This lovely walk takes you around Rye Harbour Nature Reserve on the Sussex coast. There's great scenery with a wide range of habitats including saltmarsh, lagoons, grazing marsh, shingle and reedbeds. You can follow miles of footpaths through the reserve while looking out for a huge variety of wildlife.  Birds you might see include ringed plover, avocet, oystercatcher, redshank, lapwing, and sandwich terns. There's also lots of colourful plants and flowers in the summer months.  Look out for 456 species of flowering plants including yellow horned-poppy, sea pea and sea campion. The reserve also includes Henry VIII's Camber Castle . You can visit the interesting ruins of this 16th century Device Fort, built to protect the Sussex coast against French attack. The Saxon Shore Way long distance footpath runs through the reserve so you could pick this up to extend your walk. You could visit nearby Winchelsea and then follow the waterside path along the Royal Military Canal on the Rye to Hastings Walk . Our Rye Circular Walk visits the harbour reserve, the castle and Winchelsea. Also near here is the beautiful Camber Sands , a very popular local beach. At Camber Sands you can pick up the England Coast Path and head east to the splendid Dungeness RSPB Nature Reserve . Here you will find lakes, lagoons and an expansive section of shingle beach with a wide variety of wildlife.",
