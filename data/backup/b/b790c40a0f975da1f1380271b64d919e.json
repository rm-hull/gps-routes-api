  "description": "Follow the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation Canal from Chelmsford to Maldon on this easy, waterside walk in Essex. The canal takes you through some lovely Essex countryside, passing a series of pretty locks, a number of reservoirs and the villages of Little Baddow and Ulting. At Little Baddow you can find a number of nice woodland trails in Blake's Wood, Lingwood Common and Danbury Common. The village and commons are located just to the south of the canal and contain 214 acres of heath, gorse and coppice. The final section of the canal takes you along the Heybridge Basin in Maldon, with views of the National Trust owned Northey Island. There are great views over the Blackwater Estuary to the nature reserve. You can extend the walk by visiting the lovely Marine Lake in Promenade Park which is located right on the lovely estuary. There's also the pretty Chigborough Lakes Nature Reserve near Heybridge Basin which has some nice footpaths to try.",
