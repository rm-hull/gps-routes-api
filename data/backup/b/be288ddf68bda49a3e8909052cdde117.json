  "description": "This walk visits the Maer Hills near the village of Maer in Staffordshire. There's some good country and woodland trails with fine views from the high points to enjoy in this scenic location. The walk starts in Maer where you can follow a track west past the pretty Maer Pool and the 17th century Maer Hall. Near here you can pick up the Newcastle Way waymarked trail at Maer Moss. Follow the trail north and it will take you into the Maer Hills where you can follow a series of woodland trails to Camp Wood and the 216 metre high Camp Hill at the northern end of the site. Just to the west of the hills there's the lovely Dorothy Clive Garden to visit. The tranquil garden includes a network of paths taking you to a winter garden, an edible woodland, a woodland quarry with waterfall, an alpine scree and pool, rose walk and amazing seasonal borders. It's well worth a detour from the route if you have time. You can find them in Willoughbridge at postcode TF9 4EU for your sat navs.",
