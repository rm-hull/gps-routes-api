  "description": "This walk visits Hepburn Woods in Northumberland. There's miles of peaceful woodland trails and some fine views from the adjacent Hepburn Crag. You can start your walk from the car park near to the crags and Ros Castle. From here there's trails to follow south into the woods. On the way you'll pass Bertheles stone, a large boulder that has at some time detached itself from the crags above. There's also an Iron Age Hill Fort and some pretty heather in the summer months. The crags are located just to the east of the start point for the walk. There's an Iron Age Hillfort here with lots of pretty heather during the summer months. From the elevated position of the area there are fine views towards the Cheviots .",

      "content": "Head north east from the car park and you can enjoy a climb to Ros Castle. Here you'll find an Iron Age Hillfort with fine views to the coast. Head north and you can pay a visit to Chillingham Castle. The 13th century castle is said to be the most haunted in Britain. It's surrounded by gardens, lakes and fountains with easy footpaths to explore on. You can find the castle just to the north west of the hill at postcode NE66 5NJ. From the hill top there are fine views over the estate and the wild cattle in the park. The woods are not far from Alnwick where you could try the Alnwick to Bamburgh Walk and visit the historic Bamburgh castle on the coast. To the west you can enjoy a more challenging climb to Hedgehope Hill. Wooler Common is also located a few miles to the north west and has some fine trails to try. The walk to Cateran Hole starts from the woods car park. You can follow trails east to the unusual site where you'll find a series of steps leading down to a murky underground cave. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheviots Walks and Northumberland Walks pages."
