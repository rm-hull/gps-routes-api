  "description": "This walk visits Hepburn Woods in Northumberland. There's miles of peaceful woodland trails and some fine views from the adjacent Hepburn Crag. You can start your walk from the car park near to the crags and Ros Castle. From here there's trails to follow south into the woods. On the way you'll pass Bertheles stone, a large boulder that has at some time detached itself from the crags above. There's also an Iron Age Hill Fort and some pretty heather in the summer months. The crags are located just to the east of the start point for the walk. There's an Iron Age Hillfort here with lots of pretty heather during the summer months. From the elevated position of the area there are fine views towards the Cheviots .",
