You may also spot the occasional peregrine falcon, a bird of prey that nests in the cliff faces. In the grasslands, skylarks and meadow pipits are commonly seen, their calls adding a lively soundtrack to the area. Butterflies are abundant during warmer months, with species such as the chalkhill blue, small skipper, and marbled white frequently spotted. The grassy areas also provide a home for small mammals like voles and hares, and you might even glimpse a fox or badger at dawn or dusk."

Orchids like the pyramidal orchid and the common spotted orchid thrive here, alongside species such as horseshoe vetch, bird\u2019s-foot trefoil, and thrift, which add vibrant colours to the landscape. These plants are well-suited to the nutrient-poor chalk soils and play a key role in supporting the area\u2019s biodiversity."

The area's unique combination of chalk cliffs, grasslands, and ocean creates a thriving ecosystem worth exploring."

  "description": "This exhilarating walk takes you along the highest chalk sea cliff in Britain, at Beachy Head on the South Downs. The cliffs rise to a height of 162 metres (531 ft) with fabulous views along the coast to West Sussex and Dungeness in Kent. You can start your walk from the good sized car park on Beachy Head Road which has a postcode of BN20 7YA for your sat navs. From here you can pick up the trails on to the The South Downs Way which will take you along the headland. You could also start the walk from the nearby town of Eastbourne and follow the Wealdway along the beach from the town centre. See our Eastbourne to Beachy Head Walk for details and a map. As well as the magnificent views there's some lovely countryside to explore inland. Look out for lots of wildflowers in the summer and a variety of birdlife which includes Lapwing, Skylark and Perigrin Falcon. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the Beachy Head cliff top pub which is next to the car park. To extend your walk you can continue west along the coastal path to Birling Gap and the Belle Tout Lighthouse. Beyond there is the fantastic Seven Sisters Country Park at Cuckmere Haven. Here you will find more great cycling and walking trails along the coast and the River Cuckmere.",

Outside there's a good sized garden area with nice views of the surrounding South Downs countryside. You can find the pub a short hop from the car park on Beachy Head Road. The outdoor area is also dog friendly if you have your four legged friend with you.  Pictured above the Beachy Head Pub and countryside centre. Two worthy places to stop at on the route."
