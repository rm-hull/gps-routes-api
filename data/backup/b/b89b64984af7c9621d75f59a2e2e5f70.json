  "description": "This walk takes you from Betws Y Coed to the lovely Llyn Parc in the Gwydyr Forest . It's a about a 2 mile walk from the village to the lake. The forest is in an elevated position so you will be climbing up hill on the way there before descending on the return leg. The walk starts in the popular village of Betws Y Coed where it is a short walk north to the forest. Here you can pick up a waymarked footpath heading north past the Clogwyn Cyrrau Nature Reserve and the disused mines to the lake. Look out for the waterfall at the Aberllyn mine near the lake. When you reach the lake there is then a nice footpath to follow along the water before returning on the same paths.",
