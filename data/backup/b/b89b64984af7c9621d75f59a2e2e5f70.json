  "description": "This walk takes you from Betws Y Coed to the lovely Llyn Parc in the Gwydyr Forest. It's a about a 2 mile walk from the village to the lake. The forest is in an elevated position so you will be climbing up hill on the way there before descending on the return leg. The walk starts in the popular village of Betws Y Coed where it is a short walk north to the forest. Here you can pick up a waymarked footpath heading north past the Clogwyn Cyrrau Nature Reserve and the disused mines to the lake. Look out for the waterfall at the Aberllyn mine near the lake. When you reach the lake there is then a nice footpath to follow along the water before returning on the same paths.",

      "content": "To the north you will find the noteworthy market town of Llanrwst. Here you can try the circular Llanrwst Walk which visits some of the towns highlights. These include the splendid Gwydir Estate which contains a historic castle, an ancient chapel, the Grey Mare's Tail Waterfall. The walk also visits the forest and Llyn Parc so provides an alternative route for reaching the lake. The Fishermans Walk and Lledr Gorge Walk starts just to the south west of the settlement at Pont-y-Pant railway station on the Conwy Valley line. This takes you through the beautiful scenery of the Lledr Gorge with its picturesque waterfalls, stepping stones and Pont Gethin viaduct. There's also the option of trying the Victorian Fishermans Walk, a precarious route through the gorge on a rickety old walkway. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
