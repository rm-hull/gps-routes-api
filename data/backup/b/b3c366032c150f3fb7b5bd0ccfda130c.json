  "description": "This walk visits Devon Wildlife Trust's Bystock Pools Nature Reserve near Exmouth. The tranquil reserve includes a pretty lake, a wildflower meadow and boardwalks taking you through attractive heathland. You can start the walk from the car park at the southern end of the site, next to the reservoir. The area is great for wildlife with Nightjar, Yellowhammer, Emperor dragonfly and Golden-ringed dragonfly to look out for. To extend the walk you could pick up the East Devon Way and follow it north to explore Bicton Common and Woodbury Common. There's also Squabmoor Reservoir about half a mile to the south east.",

The 15th century house is not open to the public but it can be viewed from the nearby road (Hayes Lane). Sir Walter Raleigh's father was tenant here and a Church Warden at East Budleigh where the family crest on the bench end and his step-mother's tomb can be seen today. Postcode is EX9 7BS."
