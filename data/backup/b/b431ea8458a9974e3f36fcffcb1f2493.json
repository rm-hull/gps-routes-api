  "description": "The Lancashire town of Nelson is located in the Pendle area of the county. Walking highlights include the popular Pendle Hill and easier paths along the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. There's also a number of reservoirs and great views of the Pennine Hills in the area. This route from the town uses sections of the Pendle Way, Burnley Way and Bronte Way to create a circular walk around the countryside to the east of the town. The waymarked paths will take you to a series of picturesque reservoirs with fine views over the surrounding moors. The route runs for a distance of about 8 miles with some moderate hill climbs on the way. The walk starts from Walverden Reservoir on the south eastern fringes of the town. It's located just over half a mile south east of the train station. From here you can pick up the Pendle Way and follow it east to Catlow and the Coldwell Reservoirs. There's good views over the water to Boulsworth Hill here. The hill can be climbed for wonderful views over the South Pennines. After passing along the northern end of the reservoirs you pick up the Bronte Way, following it south west through the Thursden Valley. A woodland section follows, taking you to the Burnley Way which you follow west to Cockden. The final section skirts the edge of Harle Syke and Brierfield before returning you to the reservoir.",
