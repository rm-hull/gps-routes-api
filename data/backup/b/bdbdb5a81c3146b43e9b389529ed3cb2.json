  "description": "This lovely walk takes you along Addison's Walk in the grounds of Magdalen College in Oxford. It's a very pretty area with gardens, and nice views of the River Cherwell and the adjacent deer park. There are good views of Magdalen Tower and Magdalen Bridge as you make your way along the flat, surfaced path. The gardens were a favourite place of the author C. S. Lewis, who was a fellow of Magdalen College in the early 20th century. He used to enjoy walks and chats with Hugo Dyson and J. R. R. Tolkien. On the walk you can see a plaque featuring a poem he wrote about the pretty spot. Addison's Walk is within the college grounds so you must pay a small fee to enter. Refreshments, including morning coffee and snacks, light lunches and afternoon teas are available in the Old Kitchen Bar and Riverside Terrace. If you head north to the adjacent St Catherine's College you can visit Mesopotamia Walk. It's a similar path, running along the river to the weir at Parson's Pleasure. The Oxford Canal and the Thames Path both run very close to the college. You can extend your walking by picking up either of these lovely waterside footpaths.",
