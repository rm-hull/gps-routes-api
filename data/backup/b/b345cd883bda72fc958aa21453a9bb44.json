  "description": "This lovely open space is located near Gosport and has 3 walking and cycling routes that show off the best areas of the 500 acre park. Enjoy woodland, lakes, ponds and views of the River Alver which runs through the park. There is also plenty for wildlife enthusiasts with reptiles, small mammals and a variety of birdlife to look out for. The reedbeds in the West of the River Nature Reserve are of particlar interest. Cyclists are also able to enjoy the park on surfaced trails. The Solent Way runs just south of the park. This waymarked footpath could be followed east into Gosport or west towards Lee on Solent and the lovely Titchfield Haven Nature Reserve in Fareham. The reserve is a nice place to extend your walk with a huge variety of wildlife to see. If you head east along the coastal path it will take you to Gosport where you could visit Fort Gilkicker and enjoy views of Por Portsmouth Harbour.",
