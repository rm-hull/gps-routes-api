  "description": "This village near Coventry is surrounded by some lovely countryside with a major long distance trail running right through it. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Heart of England Way and the Warwickshire Millennium Way to explore the surrounding area. On the way you'll visit the attractive neighbouring village of Berkswell and the Berkswell Windmill. The walk starts in the village and heads west to meet up with the Heart of England Way near The Elms. Follow the waymarked footpath north east and it will take you to Wootton Green before passing Berkswell Hall and coming in to Berkswell. The historic village includes a village green, old thatched cottages, a Norman church and a Grade II listed 16th century inn for refreshment. The route continues east to Benton Green before heading south to Carol Green, Beechwood and Berkswell Windmill. The Grade II listed windmill dates back to 1826. From here you follow footpaths north west back to the village.",
