  "description": "This park near Gravesend has 288 acres of rolling woodlands, wetlands and meadows that can be explored via a variety of waymarked trails, suitable for cyclists and walkers. The park has excellent on site facilities including a visitor centre, cafe, a sensory garden, fishing lakes, a trim trail and picnic and play areas. If you'd like to extend your outing then you could head to the nearby Jeskyns Park which has  woodlands, ponds, orchards and wildflower meadows to explore. Our Circular Walk around Cobham visits Shorne Woods and also takes you to Cobham Woods which is run by the National Trust. You can also find more walking trails at the nearby Camer Park which is near Meopham . Just south of the park there's Ashenbank Wood which has some lovely bluebells in spring.",
