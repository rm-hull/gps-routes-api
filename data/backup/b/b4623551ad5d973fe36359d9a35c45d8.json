  "description": "This park near Gravesend has 288 acres of rolling woodlands, wetlands and meadows that can be explored via a variety of waymarked trails, suitable for cyclists and walkers. The park has excellent on site facilities including a visitor centre, cafe, a sensory garden, fishing lakes, a trim trail and picnic and play areas. If you'd like to extend your outing then you could head to the nearby Jeskyns Park which has woodlands, ponds, orchards and wildflower meadows to explore. Our Circular Walk around Cobham visits Shorne Woods and also takes you to Cobham Woods which is run by the National Trust. You can also find more walking trails at the nearby Camer Park which is near Meopham. Just south of the park there's Ashenbank Wood which has some lovely bluebells in spring.",

This is signposted from the visitor centre where water bowls are also available. Please keep them on leads around the trim trail, visitor centre, car park, fishing lake, play areas and where the cattle are grazing."
