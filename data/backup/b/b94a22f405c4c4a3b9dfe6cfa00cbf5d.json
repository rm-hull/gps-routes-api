  "description": "This circular walk climbs this small hill made famous by the Peter Gabriel song 'Solsbury Hill'. The walk starts in the village of Batheaston , following footpaths to the hill summit and the ancient Iron Age Hill Fort. From here there are super views over Bath and the surrounding countryside of the River Avon valley. The route then heads along Chilcombe Bottom to Northend, passing two reservoirs on the way. The last section follows the waymarked Limestone Link back to Batheaston. If you're coming from the centre of Bath you can reach the hill by following the Kennet and Avon Canal to Bathampton and then picking up the Limestone Link to take you to Little Solsbury Hill.",
