  "description": "This circular walk climbs this small hill made famous by the Peter Gabriel song 'Solsbury Hill'. The walk starts in the village of Batheaston, following footpaths to the hill summit and the ancient Iron Age Hill Fort. From here there are super views over Bath and the surrounding countryside of the River Avon valley. The route then heads along Chilcombe Bottom to Northend, passing two reservoirs on the way. The last section follows the waymarked Limestone Link back to Batheaston. If you're coming from the centre of Bath you can reach the hill by following the Kennet and Avon Canal to Bathampton and then picking up the Limestone Link to take you to Little Solsbury Hill.",

There's a lovely large garden and courtyard area where you can relax with views over the water. Inside there's a sylish interior with a log fire and delicious Mediterranean cuisine to sample from the menu. You can find them right on the river on Mill Lane with a postcode of BA2 6TS for your sat navs. There's also a large car park if you wanted to start a walk from there."

The museum is one of the highlights of the area and well worth a visit. It takes you on a journey through the history of America with exhibitions and a fine collection of folk and decorative arts. There's also 125 acres of grounds with views of the Limpley Stoke Valley and the River Avon. For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks page."
