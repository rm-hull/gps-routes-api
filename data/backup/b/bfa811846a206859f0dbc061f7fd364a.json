  "description": "Enjoy woodlands, waterfalls and a walk along the River Clyde in this delightful nature reserve in Lanark. The falls comprise of Bonnington Linn, Corra Linn, Dundaff Linn, and the lower falls of Stonebyres Linn. Corra Linn is the highest, with a fall of 84 feet.  The Clyde Gorge is a haven for wildlife - look out for peregrine falcons, badgers, bats, roe deer, otters, kingfishers and over 100 species of bird. There's an excellent Visitor Centre with a lot of information on the falls and the animals that dwell there. The Clyde Walkway long distance walk path runs through the reserve so you could pick this up and continue your walk along the River Clyde. Also nearby is Lanark Moor Country Park where you can enjoy a walk around Lanark Loch.",
