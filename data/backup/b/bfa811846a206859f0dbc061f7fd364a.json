  "description": "Enjoy woodlands, waterfalls and a walk along the River Clyde in this delightful nature reserve in Lanark. The falls comprise of Bonnington Linn, Corra Linn, Dundaff Linn, and the lower falls of Stonebyres Linn. Corra Linn is the highest, with a fall of 84 feet. The Clyde Gorge is a haven for wildlife - look out for peregrine falcons, badgers, bats, roe deer, otters, kingfishers and over 100 species of bird. There's an excellent Visitor Centre with a lot of information on the falls and the animals that dwell there. The Clyde Walkway long distance walk path runs through the reserve so you could pick this up and continue your walk along the River Clyde. Also nearby is Lanark Moor Country Park where you can enjoy a walk around Lanark Loch.",

      "content": "South of Lanark there's a popular climb to Tinto Hill to try. The hill is an excellent local viewpoint with fine views over the hills and countryside of the Southern Uplands. The hill top is also home to one of the largest Bronze Age round cairns in Scotland. Just north of Lanark there's a pleasant walk through the Clyde Valley Woodlands which includes a pleasant riverside path along Mouse Water and pretty waterfalls. Head north west to Crossford and you can visit the ruins of the ancient Craignethan Castle. You'll also visit the Lower Nethan Gorge Nature Reserve, another section of the Clyde Valley Woodlands."
