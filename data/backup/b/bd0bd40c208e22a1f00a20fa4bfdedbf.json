The foreground fields up to the fence with the single tree are public - but certainly rather improved. The near shoulder on the right is not CROW-public but is unimproved (although possibly partly ploughed in the past). The far shoulder on the right is correctly public and unimproved. Both shoulders are in the Castle Hill NNR. The slopes on the left are correctly selected as public access unimproved downland. However, the non-CROW part of the NNR is now mapped as access land under some other non-CROW arrangement."

  "description": "This circular walk visits the Castle Hill National Nature Reserve on the eastern outskirts of Brighton in the South Downs National Park. There's miles of good walking trails taking you across the chalk grassland with ancient settlements and glorious views to the coast. In the summer months there's lots of lovely wildflowers with wildlife including the Lesser Whitethroat and Fulmars at the cliffs in the local nature reserve near Newhaven. You can start the walk from the car park just to the south of Falmer. Then pick up the trails heading east to Newmarket Hill and Cold Coombes. You continue round Balsdean Bottom and Standean Bottom before passing Bullock Hill and returning to the car park. The South Downs Way crosses the reserve. You could follow the trail east to visit Iford , Rodmell and the River Ouse. There's also the Castle Hill Local Nature Reserve to the south east in Newhaven. See the video below for more details of this smaller, coastal site.",
