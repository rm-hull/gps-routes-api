    "description": "Explore three way-marked trails in this country park created on a former colliery site. There's a delightful wetlands area with boardwalks, peaceful woodland trails, pretty lakes and open grassland. You can climb the High Point Observatory for spectacular views across the county and admire the park's sculptures which include the 'Sultan' pit pony - one of the UK\u2019s largest figurative earth sculptures. For cyclists National Cycle Route 47 runs through the park. You could pick this up and head east to the lovely Sirhowy Valley Country Park on the safe off road track. The Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk also runs through the park so this is a good way of extending your walk. The park is located close to Ystrad Mynach rail station and not far from Hengoed.",
