  "description": "This walk explores the beautiful Hay Meadows around the village of Muker in the Yorkshire Dales. In the summer months they are covered with lovely wildflowers which attract a variety of wildlife. The walk starts in the village and then picks up a pleasant footpath heading north through the meadows to the River Swale. Along the way you will pass old barns and enjoy some fine views of the surrounding countryside and hills. You can extend your outing on the Muker to Keld Walk which will take you along the river to nearby Keld.",
