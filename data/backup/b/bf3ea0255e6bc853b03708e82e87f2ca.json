Roulston Scar is the site of one of the most important prehistoric monuments in the region - a huge hillfort built in the Iron Age, around 400 BC. It marked the site of the Battle of Old Byland, where on 14 October 1322, the Scots achieved a significant triumph over the English. King Robert the Bruce orchestrated a rapid march with his army, aiming to catch the English forces off guard as they retreated from a failed invasion of Scotland. Meanwhile, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, occupied the elevated position of Sutton Bank, while King Edward II and his Queen sought refuge at Rievaulx Abbey, approximately 16 miles (25 km) to the south-east. The Scots valiantly ascended the steep hillside, ultimately overpowering the Earl and capturing him. King Edward hastily fled ahead of Sir Walter Stewart's advancing forces, abandoning the Great Seal of England and substantial treasures at the Abbey."

  "description": "This challenging circular walk in the North York Moors visits the Kilburn White Horse, the lovely Gormire Lake and the scar at Sutton Bank. It's one of the premium walks in the park and a must see if you are in the area. You start at the car park which sits just under the white horse and pick up the Cleveland Way to take you to the 978 ft (298 m) summit of Sutton Bank. The hill is a high point in the Hambleton Hills and commands splendid views over the North York Moors, the Vale of York and the Vale of Mowbray. At the summit you will find the fascinating Sutton Bank National Park Centre where you can find out how the dramatic landscape was formed in the ice age. From the viewing platform there are views of Roulston Scar, Hood Hill and Lake Gormire. There's a handy view indicator which displays all the landmarks you can see. Also look for gliders setting off from the top of the hill on fine days. From the summit you descend through woodland to Gormire Lake, passing the striking Whitestone Cliff as you go. You continue through the countryside before a final woodland section through the Hoodhill Field Plantation returns you to the car park. The area is also great for mountain biking. The North York Moors National Park Authority has created a green, blue and red trail. These are all waymarked and start from the Sutton Bank National Park Centre where you can hire bikes. Our Hambleton Hills Walk starts from the Kilburn White Horse and is a great way of extending your walking in this lovely area. Just to the south east you can also visit the splendid Byland Abbey. The 12th century abbey includes extensive ruins and wonderful brightly coloured medieval floor tiles.",

This fine restaurant has a Michelin Star and was awarded The Best Restaurant in the UK 2018 by The Food and Travel Magazine and the \u2018Best Fine Dining Restaurant in the World\u2019 by TripAdvisor, in 2017.

      "content": "Just a few miles north east of the site you will find Rievaulx Abbey. The abbey is well worth a visit if you have time after your walk. Here you can explore the ruins of the former Cistercian abbey before continuing to the beautiful Rievaulx Terrace. These 18th-century landscape gardens contain woodland, grass banks, wildflower meadows and two temples. It's another major highight of the area and makes for an easy stroll after the more challenging climb. Head a few miles south and you could pay a visit to the worthy little village of Coxwold on the edge of the Howardian Hills. The village is notable as the location where the author Laurence Sterne wrote the well known novel 'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy'. You can learn about his life and works at the museum at Shandy Hall, where he wrote some of his most famous novels during the 18th century. In the village you can pick up the circular Coxwold Walk which visits Newburgh Priory and Shandy Hall before heading to Byland Abbey. The priory is another historic highlight of the area dating back to 1145. The grounds are a lovely place for a stroll with a water garden, hand crafted topiary, a walled garden, woodland and a large lake.  The circular Felixkirk Walk visits the hill from the nearby village. For more walking ideas in the area see the North York Moors Walks page."
