  "description": "This Surrey based village is located near Tadworth in the North Downs. This circular walk explores Walton Heath and Banstead Heath which lie just to the south of the settlement. The walk starts in the centre of the village next to the pretty mere pond. There's miles of footpaths on the heaths with features including meadow grasses, wildflowers, woodland and mixed heather. You'll also pass around the old golf course whose former members include King Edward VIII, Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George.",
