  "description": "The Herefordshire Trail takes you on a tour of the area's prettiest villages, rivers, parks, woodland, countryside and hills. This section runs from Ross on Wye to the town of Bromyard via Ledbury. Starting in Ross on Wye the trail heads north to the riverside settlement of Hole-in-the-Wall. You then turn east and head to Crow Hill, passing the woodland of Eaton Park on the way. From here the route turns north again towards Ledbury, with some long countryside sections interrupted with woodland trails through Yatton Wood and Hoar Wood. You'll pass the villages of Putley and Aylton on this part of the walk. There's also nice views of Marcle Ridge and Marcle Hill. You can cllimb the ridge and enjoy some fabulous views of the Malvern Hills, the Cotswold Hills, the Wye Valley, the Brecon Beacons and the Black Mountains. The next section takes you north from Ledbury to Coddington, passing Wellington Heath, Frith Wood and Berrington Wood on the way. You continue to Bosbury and Bishops Frome before finishing at the town of Bromyard. The route runs very close to the Wye Valley Walk for part of the way.",
