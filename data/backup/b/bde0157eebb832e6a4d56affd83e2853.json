  "description": "Enjoy woodland trails and wonderful views over the Severn Vale and the Cotswolds on this circular walk near Stroud. There are miles of walking and cycling trails on which to explore the large estate. On the way you will pass wildflower meadows, an Iron Age hill fort and the Bronze Age Long Barrow of Haresfield Beacon. This walk starts at the car park and follows the Cotswold Way National Trail through Standish Wood . You pass the Long Barrow and Standish Quarry before heading through the countryside to Oxlynch. The path then passes Vinegar Hill and Ring Hill before reaching the topograph where you can enjoy splendid views. From the topograph it is a short walk back to the car park and the finish point. The area is superb for interesting flora and fauna. Look out for bluebells in Standish woods and orchids and butterflies in the limestone grasslands. You may also see buzzards\u00a0and kestrels from the viewpoints. The whole of this route is for walkers but much of it is suitable for mountain bikers too. If you would like to continue your walking in this beautiful area then you could head south of Stroud and visit Rodborough Common and Woodchester Park for more great walking trails. You could also pick the Cotswold Canals Walk and enjoy waterside walking along the Stroudwater canal through Stroud.",
