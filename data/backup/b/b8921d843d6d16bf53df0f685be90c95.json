The former monastery was founded in the 12th century when a community of nuns came to this peaceful area to create their nunnery the Abbey of St. Mary de la Pre. Today the site is a popular tourist attraction with 500 acres of parkland, lakes, woodland and gardens to explore. The River Nene also runs past the northern side of the park. You could pick up the Nene Way and follow it west to link up with the Grand Union Canal Walk if you felt like extending your outing. There's also the climb and Iron Age hill fort at Hunsbury Hill Country Park about a mile to the west.",
