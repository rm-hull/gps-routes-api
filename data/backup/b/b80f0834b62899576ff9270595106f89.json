  "description": "This circular walk explores the area surrounding the Buckinghamshire town of Wendover. The loop runs for just over 7 miles following the Wendover Canal Arm of the Grand Union Canal before exploring Wendover Woods. The route starts on the canal and follows the towpath north to Halton. Near Aston Clinton you leave the canal and head south into Wendover Woods. The expansive woods are a popular place for walkers with several waymarked trails including a lovely easy access trail for all abilities. On the way you can see sculptures, deciduous trees, evergreen trees and many woodland flowers. There are also splendid views of the surrounding Chilterns countryside. At the southern end of the woods you pick up the Icknield Way Path. You follow the waymarked path west along Hale Lane to return to the town. The route passes close to the pretty Weston Turville Reservoir where you can take a small detour and look out for a wide variety of birdlife on the water. To extend your walking in the area you could continue along the canal to the nearby Tring Reservoirs. The reservoirs are fantastic for birdwatching with visitors including grebes, bitterns, peregrine falcon, pied flycatcher and ringed plovers. You could also visit the lovely Tring Park. In the park you will find expansive areas of grassland and pretty bluebell woods ideal for a peaceful afternoon stroll. Our Tring Circular Walk visits the park, Wiggington village and the reservoirs before another nice waterside stroll along the canal.",

      "content": "In the woods you could stop off at the new on site Wendover Woods Cafe, located right next to the main car park. There's lots of tables outside where you can enjoy a meal with great views of the trees. It's a lovely spot to take the weight of your feet. They serve a wide range of tasty hot and cold locally sourced food (including daily specials), delicious cakes and freshly baked pastries, as well as a range of hot and cold Fairtrade drinks. Just to the north of the cafe there's a bookable BBQ area if you fancy bringing along your own food to cook. Just email wendoverbbq@forestryengland.uk for more info. For cyclists the town makes a good entry point for the epic Chilterns Cycleway. The signed circular trail runs for about 170 miles through the Chilterns AONB on quiet country lanes, visiting a series of delightful villages."
