  "description": "This lovely circular walk explores both sides of the beautiful Avon Estuary in south Devon. The coastal views over Bigbury Bay are wonderful and there's a huge variety of wildlife to look out for on the way. Keep your eyes peeled for sandpiper, little egrets, greenshank, curlew, lapwing, widgeon, teal and redshank as you make your way along the estuary. Start your walk from the Bantham Sands car park at the southern end of the estuary. You can then catch the ferry over the river to Bigbury on Sea. It's a seasonal crossing so click here for details of the running times. The path then heads north, passing the village of Bigbury, before coming to Aveton Gifford at the head of the estuary. Here you can enjoy refreshments at the local pub and explore the church which has elements dating from the 13th century. After exploring the village you cross the river on the Aveton Gifford Bridge and follow the trail along the eastern side of the estuary. You'll pass mainly through farmland with a short woodland stretch through Stiddicombe Wood. The trail then passes Bantham before returning to the car park. To extend your walking in the area you can head to Burgh Island. You can walk to the island at low tide or catch the sea tractor which is run by the island's hotel. Just to the west you can enjoy similar walk along the Erme Estuary. There's lots more birds to look out for here with some woodland trails and coastal views. You can follow the South West Coast Path all the way to the Erme Estuary.",
