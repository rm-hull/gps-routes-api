  "description": "This beautiful nature reserve on the North Gower coast has lovely walking trails through woodland and sand dunes with nice coastal views. The area is fantastic for wildlife watching with several species of wading birds and wildfowl too look out for. The walk starts from the parking area in Llanmadoc and heads through Cwm Ivy where there are some nice woodland trails and Cwm Ivy marsh. You continue to Berges Island where you can enjoy great views across the sands to the lighthouse at Whiteford Point. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb the sandstone ridge across Cefn Bryn. The climb to Cefn Bryn beacon offers fabulous views over the Gower.",

The beams in the lounge of the inn are reputed to be from shipwrecks which were \u201clanterned\u201d ashore by wreckers for their valuable cargo. The pub still has its original fireplace and bread oven. In addition in parts of the pub one can still see the original gas lamps.It's also great in the summer months with good sized beer gardens surrounding the place. To the rear you can enjoy superb views of the Loughor Estuary and for the children there is a menagerie of small animals such as rabbits, and budgies. You can find it at postcode SA3 1DB for your sat navs."
