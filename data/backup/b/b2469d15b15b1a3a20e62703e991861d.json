  "description": "This beautiful nature reserve on the North Gower coast has lovely walking trails through woodland and sand dunes with nice coastal views. The area is fantastic for wildlife watching with several species of wading birds and wildfowl too look out for. The walk starts from the parking area in Llanmadoc\u00a0and heads through Cwm Ivy where there are some nice woodland trails and Cwm Ivy marsh. You continue to Berges Island where you can enjoy great views across the sands to the lighthouse at Whiteford Point. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb the sandstone ridge across Cefn Bryn . The climb to Cefn Bryn beacon offers fabulous views over the Gower.",
