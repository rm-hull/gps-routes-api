  "description": "Explore this beautiful island and RSPB Nature Reserve on this circular walk off the Pembrokeshire Coast. There are great walking trails running from the ferry landing taking you around the southern and middle section of the island. Ramsey is run by the RSPB so it's wonderful for bird watching with guillemots, razorbills, kttiwakes and fulmars to look out for. The island also has 120m high cliffs where you may see choughs and peregrines.   In spring and summer Ramsey is covered in pretty flowers including bluebells, spring squills, pink thrift and purple heather. To reach the island you can catch a boat from St Justinians from April (or easter if it comes sooner) to October. See the RSPB link below for details. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could try the Treginnis Peninsula walk.",
