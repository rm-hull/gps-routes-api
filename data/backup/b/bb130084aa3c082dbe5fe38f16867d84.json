  "description": "This impressive staircase of locks in Foxton are a popular tourist attraction. The flight of ten locks are located on the Leicester line of the Grand Union Canal. The locks are also designated as a country park with lovely walks along the canal and into the surrounding countrsyide. This 4.5 mile circular walk includes long canalside stretches, a woodland trail, lovely rural views and a visit to the village of Foxton. The walk starts right next to the locks at the Foxton Locks car park and heads west along the canal to Gumley Wood. A public footpath skirts the eastern edge of the peaceful wood. You follow it north past Debdale Grange before returning to the canal. Follow the towpath east to Debdale Wharf before turning south to return to the locks. You can then turn east and enjoy a short stroll into Foxton village. Here you can seek out the 13th century St Andrew's Church which sits at the highest and southernmost point of the parish. Also of interest is Manor House, situated south of the Grand Union Canal and north of Swingbridge Street. The 18th-century farmhouse sits on the site of an old Norman Manor. At the end of your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the waterside Foxton Locks Inn. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Leicestershire Round long distance trail. It runs right past the site and will take you to Saddington Reservoir and Shearsby if you follow it in a westerly direction. You could also continue east along the canal and visit Market Harborough. Our Market Harborough Canal Walk starts at the canal basin in the town and follows the towpath to the site. You can virtually explore the area using the google street view link below!",

      "content": "A few miles to the east there's Hallaton to explore. The village includes a particularly picturesque pond, a 13th century church and quaint thatched cottages. Hallaton is also the location for the famous annual bottle kicking contest which takes place on Easter Monday. The circular Kibworth Walk starts from the nearby village and visits Saddington Reservoir before heading to the locks. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northamptonshire Walks page."
