  "description": "The popular village of Clapham makes a great base for exploring the Yorkshire Dales. The village is accessible by public transport via Clapham railway station which is situated 1 mile (1.6 km) south-west of the village. Since the 18th century Clapham has been home to the Farrer family who established their Ingleborough estate. The family owns, and is responsible for, much of the land, walls, woods, fields and moors of the village, surrounding countryside and farms. The village is a popular start point for climbing Ingleborough Mountain and the fascinating glacial erratic boulders at Norber Erratics. This short walk takes you from the village to Ingleborough Cave which is situated just over a mile to the north of the village. It's a lovely area with the pretty Clapham Beck running past Clapham Lake before a peaceful woodland section through Clapdale Wood. The footpaths eventually lead to Ingleborough Cave (formerly known as Clapham Caves), a show cave adjacent to where the water from Gaping Gill resurges. That part of the cave which is open to the public follows a fossil gallery for some 500 metres (1,640 ft). The passage is spacious, and well decorated with stalagmitic formations. After exploring the cave the route returns to the village along the same paths. To extend your walking in the area head west to the village of Ingleton and try the wonderful Ingleton Falls Walk. It's one of the highlights the Yorkshire Dales with a series of stunning waterfalls dotted along a riverside path. The long distance Pennine Bridleway also passes through the village and is another good option.",

The historic mullioned farmhouse was built in 1640 and has since been renovated to house the Clapham Bunkhouse (Group Accommodation) and The Reading Room Cafe/Bar licensed to sell hot food, alcohol, arts, crafts and gifts. It's got a great menu and sells some fine real ales. You can find it on Church Avenue at postcode LA2 8EQ.The New Inn is another good option, set in an 18th-century coaching inn overlooking the Clapham Beck (Postcode:LA2 8HH). There's also the Game Cock in Austwick which is a traditional Dales pub on the village green, serving good British food with a French/Mediterranean twist (postcode: LA2 8BB)."
