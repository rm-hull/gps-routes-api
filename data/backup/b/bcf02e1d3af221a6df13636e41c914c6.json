  "description": "Follow the Undercliff Walk from Brighton Marina to Saltdean on this exhilarating coastal walk or cycle. The path runs for about 3 miles along the sea wall with the wonderful white cliffs on one side and the shingle beach and sea on the other. It can be a very exciting walk when the waves are crashing against the sea wall but do take care on particularly windy days as the water can come right over onto the path. The route passes along National Cycle Network route 2 so it's open to cyclists as well. Please note that pedestrians have priority so please keep to a reasonable speed on your ride. The path is flat and well surfaced so it's a nice easy ride for beginners or families to try. The path starts from the marina about a mile east from the town centre. You pass Roedean and Rottingdean before finishing at the village of Saltdean. Here you will find the Grade II Listed Saltdean Lido built in 1937-38 to designs by the architect Richard Jones. There's plenty of nice cafes along the way where you can stop for refreshments before starting the return leg. You could return via Ovingdean and the East Brighton Golf course on more elevated paths as an alternative. If you felt like extending your walk you can continue to Newhaven along the wonderful Brighton to Newhaven clifftop path .",

You can find them at postcode BN2 8SQ for your sat navs."

      "content": "Just a few miles to the north of Rottingdean you'll find the interesting village of Iford. The historic settlement includes 18 listed buildings, a 12th century church and a sundial marking the Greenwich meridian which runs through the village. From here you can enjoy a walk up to the viewpoint at Iford Hill on a particularly lovely section of the South Downs. On the Iford walk there's also Rodmell where you can visit the National Trust's Monk's House. The 16th-century weatherboarded cottage was once the home of author Virginia Woolfe and her husband. Next to the village there's also the Castle Hill National Nature Reserve. The significant site includes chalk grassland with ancient settlements and lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. Above the walk there's Telscombe Cliffs where you can enjoy some wonderful sea views from the cliff top path. This will take you to the noteworthy Meridian Monument. This monument marks where Peacehaven lies on the meridian. On the cliffs there's also a fine, elevated pub with more views from the garden area."
