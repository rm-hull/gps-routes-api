      "caption": "Felton Old Bridge 1. The medieval bridge at Felton was probably built in the 15th century and has three arches spanning the River Coquet. Despite having been widened in the 18th or 19th century, it now carries only pedestrian traffic, a new bridge having been built next to it in the early 20th century. The bridge is built of sandstone and each pier has pointed cutwaters to help the water flow around them. Little documentary evidence has been found for the history of the bridge but an early charter shows there has been a bridge of some kind at Felton since at least the 12th century."

This is a Scheduled Monument and Grade II* Listed Building protected by law. At one time this bridge carried the Great North Road (A1) even when the bridge was replaced Felton could be a bit of a bottle neck. Since a by-pass was built Felton had returned to its more tranquil days."

  "description": "This picturesque Northumberland village has some lovely trails along the River Coquet in Felton Park. This walk from the village takes you west along the river to visit the historic Brinkburn Priory. The route follows the St Oswald's Way, a long distance footpath which runs through the village. The walk starts in the village and heads west through the woodland of Felton Park. The park was created in the 13th century by Roger de Bertram, who lived at the 11th century Mitford castle near Morpeth. The route passes through the woodland and streams of the park before following the river to Catheugh and Weldon Bridge. Shortly after you arrive at Brinkburn Mill and Priory. The 12th century Augustinian Priory church is run by English and Heritage and is a bit of hidden gem of the area. The restored church is one of the best examples of early Gothic architecture in Northumberland. After exploring the abbey the route returns to the village on the same paths.",
