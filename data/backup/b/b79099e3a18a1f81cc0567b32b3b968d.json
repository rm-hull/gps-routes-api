  "description": "This 18th century hall near Ripon has extensive grounds with views over the River Ure, herbaceous borders and woodland walks. The house is open to the public from 21 March until 1 October. It was originally built in the 1690s by Sir Christopher Wren. The gardens are extensive and varied and include a rock garden, rose garden and tropical garden. The footpaths are well laid out and surfaced. There's great facilities with ample parking, an adventure playground for children and a nice cafe. After exploring the magnificent grounds you can extend your walk by picking up the Ripon Canal towpath which joins with the River Ure, just to the west of the house. The long distance Ripon Rowel also passes the house so you could pick this up to further explore the countryside and villages surrounding the Yorkshire cathedral city. Also nearby is the magnificent Studley Park and Fountains Abbey where you will find 800 acres of parkland and gardens with miles of good footpaths to try.",
