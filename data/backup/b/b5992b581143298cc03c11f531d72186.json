The park covers 250 acres of countryside combined with a 150 acre golf course that together form the High Elms estate, originally the country home of the Lubbock family. In the 1840's Sir John Lubbock II developed the new house and grounds in a classical Italian style with tree's collected from around the world. His son Lord Avebury was one of the foremost public figures of his day and was responsible for the Open Spaces act (1896) which enabled his former estate to be transferred to Bromley Council in 1965, as a Green Belt open space. Unfortunately the house was destroyed by fire, but some of the formal gardens survived and are still maintained. This is a model orchard in the old walled gardens."

  "description": "Enjoy the woodlands, nature centre, ice well, formal gardens and wildflower meadows in this 250 acre country park in Orpington . You'll also find the Clock House, Grade II listed building and the attractive Yew avenue (created 1896) in this varied and interesting park. Chelsfield rail station is about a mile from the park but there are also car parks at the park. The Cudham Circular Walk passes through the park so you can pick up this trail to extend your walking in the area. The circular walk takes you through the woodland and farmland surrounding Cudham and Downe in Bromley . You could also pick up the long distance London Loop which takes you on a tour of the city's best parks, gardens and historic sites. If you head a short distance to west it will take you to Hayes Common and Keston Common where there's some nice woodland trails and good dog walking opportunites.",
