  "description": "This is a short walk around the delightful Decoy Country Park in Newton Abbot, Devon. You will pass around the lake and then onto a series of peaceful woodland trails before returning to the start point at the car park. The park includes a Wildlife Discovery Centre, Nature Reserve and a watersports centre. It's located just to the south of the town centre and not far from the train station. To continue your walking in the town try our Newton Abbot Walk. This takes you north from the town along the Stover Canal, leading you to the lovely Stover Country Park .",
