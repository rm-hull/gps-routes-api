  "description": "Visit these pretty falls in Trefriw and enjoy a stroll along the rushing water of the River Crafnant. From the parking area follow the trails along the river behind the mills to the falls. There's little bridges which make nice viewpoints down to the falls. After exploring the falls you can enjoy a riverside walk along the Crafnant to the point where it joins the River Conwy, just north of the village. The Fairy Falls hotel is a great place for refreshments after your walk. To extend your walking in the area head south west and visit the beautiful Llyn Geirionydd and Llyn Crafnant. There's two lovely circular trails to try here with wonderful views of the Carneddau mountains.",
