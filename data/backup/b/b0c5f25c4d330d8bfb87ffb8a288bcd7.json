      "content": "More Information about the site: The pond is part of the larger Burton Park Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), nationally recognised for its diverse wetland habitats, rare flora, rich birdlife, and thriving invertebrate communities. Chingford Pond, in close proximity, holds the status of a Site of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCI). This tranquil body of water is adorned with floating yellow water lilies and surrounded by dense reedbeds. These reeds provide shelter for wintering bitterns and are a nesting ground for Reed Warblers. Burton Mill Pond is a notable Sussex location for spotting Cowbane, an uncommon member of the carrot plant family. The pond is also flanked by carr woodland, an environment characterised by waterlogged conditions ideal for alder and willow trees. This unique habitat supports the breeding of Woodcock, and attracts various birds like Gadwall, Teal, Great Crested and Little Grebes, and Kingfishers, drawn to the blend of open water and rich surrounding habitats.During the Elizabethan era, this region was renowned for its extensive iron-making industry. Local blast furnaces produced brittle cast iron, which was then transformed into a more robust material. To achieve this, the streams at Burton were dammed to create a 'hammer pond', which supplied the necessary water power to operate a forge's water wheel. This water wheel was essential for powering bellows and large mechanical hammers. These hammers, delivering up to 150 blows per minute, forged the iron into short, thick bars known as anconies. By the 1780s, the pond underwent a significant shift in usage. The water power, previously harnessed for iron forging, was repurposed for grinding corn in a water mill. This mill, now a private residence, still stands and is a visible reminder of the area's rich industrial past."
