  "description": "This walk visits Haddon Hall near Bakewell and Over Haddon in the Derbyshire Peak District. The hall has some lovely walking trails taking you around the Medieval Parkland. The Grade 1 listed park has remained largely undisturbed for hundreds of years and includes a diversity of habitats. Well laid out paths will take you to woodland, the River Wye, water meadows, a walled garden, wetlands and former stretches of farmland. At certain times you can enjoy guided walks and talks where you can learn all about the history and ecology of the park. To continue your parkland walking head north east to visit the famous Chatsworth Park where there's a wonderful deer park and riverside trails along the River Derwent."
