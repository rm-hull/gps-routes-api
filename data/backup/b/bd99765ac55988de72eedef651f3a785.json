  "description": "This circular walk takes you to Lower Laithe Reservoir near Haworth in the Sladen Valley. The walk starts in the little village of Stanbury and heads east towards Reservoir Road. You can then turn south along this country lane to pass along the eastern side of the reservoir. There's great views across the water to the surrounding Bronte Moors. The route then follows footpaths west past Enfield Side before turning north to Back Lane. You can then head east to return to Stanbury. The southern part of the route skirts the edge of Penistone Hill Country Park where you can extend the walk. There's a great viewpoint here and a car park which makes an alternative start point to the route. Stanbury is also on the popular Bronte Waterfall and Top Withens Walk which is one of the highlights of the area.",
