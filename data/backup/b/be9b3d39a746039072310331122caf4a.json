This pyramidal obelisk was erected to the memory of a racehorse called \"Beware Chalk Pit\" which won the Hunters Plate at Worthy Down races in October 1734. The plaque at the monument say that \"underneath lies buried a horse the property of Paulet St John esq. that in the month of September 1733 leaped into a chalk pit twentyfive feet deep a foxhunting with his master on his back\". The story is that his master was so grateful that his surefooted horse prevented his early death that he had this monument built. Probing during the recent restoration revealed no evidence of a horse's remains under the mound. It is possible that the mound is a bronze-age bowl barrow, but no archaeological work has been carried out to confirm this."

  "description": "Walk from Salisbury to Winchester on the Clarendon Way and enjoy some wonderful scenery. The route takes you through the counties of Hampshire and Wiltshire and runs for a distance of about 25 miles. The path starts next to Salisbury Cathedral and heads through Milford and past the photogenic ruins of Clarendon Palace before a short wooded section takes you to Pitton. You then cross the hills to West and Middle Winterslow and descend into Broughton where you join a lovely country lane that takes you onto Houghton. Here you cross the River Test on your way to the worthy village of King's Somborne with its 17th century pub and 13th century church. Another wooded section through Parnholt woods then leads to the beautiful Farley Mount Country Park where at the highest point there is a pyramid shaped folly that gives the park its name. The final section sees the walker descend into the city of Winchester, passing through the outskirts and then along the River Itchen to finish next to the famous cathedral.",
