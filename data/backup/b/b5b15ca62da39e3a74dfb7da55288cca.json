  "description": "The 1000 acres of parkland and gardens surrounding this stately home is a walker's paradise. There are peaceful woodland trails, two large lakes, a series of ponds, formal gardens and fountains. There's a lovely walled garden with romantic Italianate trellises and peaceful woodland trails in the Yorkshire Arboretum. The Arboretum covers\u00a0120 acres and includes a wonderful collection of trees from all over the world. There's also beautiful rhododendrons and a wildflower meadow to enjoy. All the while there is the beautiful surrounding countryside of the Howardian Hills making a splendid backdrop. The house itself has been categorised as 'One of the World's Top Ten Greatest Mansions and Grand Houses' in Lonely Planet's 1,000 Ultimate Sights. It was\u00a0used as the fictional 'Brideshead', in the 1981\u00a0TV adaptation\u00a0of Evelyn Waugh's\u00a0Brideshead Revisited\u00a0and the two-hour 2008\u00a0remake\u00a0for cinema. The Centenary Way runs past the estate so you could easily pick this up and extend your walk into this AONB. The lovely village of Terrington is nearby so you could head there and enjoy a circular walk exploring the woodland, farmland and hills surrounding the village. Also nearby is the town of Malton where there are riverside paths along the River Derwent and a fascinating Roman Fort to see.",
