Tall, simply moulded base, with a plaque misleadingly inscribed: \"MDCCLXXXI ERECTED AT THE EXPENSE OF WILLIAM AISLABIE ESQUIRE, WHO REPRESENTED THIS BOROUGH IN PARLIAMENT SIXTY YEARS. THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND ASSISTANTS OF RIPON ORDERED THIS INSCRIPTION, MDCCLXXXV THE HONOURABLE FREDERICK ROBINSON, MAYOR.\" Obelisk surmounted by tall wrought iron weather-vane incorporating a representation of the Wakeman's Horn. Eighty feet high. Built by John Aislabie of Studley Royal. William Aislabie's contribution in 1781 must have been to repair it. He may also have removed the wrought iron railings surrounding it, and replaced them with 4 smaller obelisks at the corners, which have also been removed since."
