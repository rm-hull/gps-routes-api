  "description": "This pretty North Yorkshire village sits just to the east of Hovingham in Ryedale. Local walking highlights include the lakes and woods at nearby Castle Howard and the wonderful Howardian Hills around Terrington . In the village there's a splendid mid 18th century pub for rest and refreshment after your exercise. This circular walk from the village takes you to Slingsby Bank Woods to the south of the settlement. It then picks up a section of the long distance Ebor Way to visit Fryton Woods and Hovingham. Along the way there are peaceful woodland trails, attractive countryside and views of the Wath Beck which runs through the area. Neighbouring Hovingham is particularly appealing with with\u00a0a historic Saxon Church, a pretty beck and a picturesque cricket pitch by the 18th century Hovingham Hall.",
