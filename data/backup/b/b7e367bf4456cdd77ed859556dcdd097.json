  "description": "Explore over 350 acres of lakes, wetland, woodland, grassland and scrub in this popular nature reserve near Nottingham. The reserve sits at the confluence of the River Erewash and the River Trent and contains several large lakes which attract a wide variety of birdlife. Look out for kingfisher, shoveler, diving ducks and herons. It is located right next to Attenborough train station and on the Trent Valley Way walking route, so you have the option of continuing your walk on this riverside footpath. The Erewash Valley Trail cycle and walk trail also passes through the reserve so you could pick this up. There is also an excellent nature centre with interactive educational displays and a cafe overlooking the lakes and islands of the reserve.",
