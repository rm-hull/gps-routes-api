  "description": "This 15th century castle in Inverurie is surrounded by attractive parkland, lovely gardens and peaceful woodland. There are two pleasant waymarked walking trails to follow around the grounds. On the way you can see specimen trees, herbaceous borders and a picturesque pond. Look out for wildlife including swifts, treecreepers, long-tailed tits and coal tits. The castle itself is very photogenic with turrets, balustrades and gables. It is often used as a wedding venue.",
