It is a very quiet, relaxing spot, where you can either take in the views or go for walk around the lakes. The walks takes you through the woods where there are more hidden surprises. Bursting with wild life, you may catch a glimpse of a rare species, a migrant bird. An ideal nature reserve, easily accessed from either the M25 or M23, good free parking, with refreshment available."

      "content": "If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Solihull Way which starts at the lakes. The Stratford Upon Avon Canal is also nearby so this is another place where you can enjoy more waterside walks. The circular Solihull Walk visits the lakes and the Grand Union Canal.Just a few miles to the east of the lake you will find the National Trust owned Packwood House. There's grounds of the 16th century house include a pretty lake, herbaceous borders, wildflower meadows, splendid topiary and a beautiful orchard. The Reigate and Banstead Millennium Trail also passes the park. You could pick up and follow it south to visit the town of Horley next to Gatwick Airport. Just to the south there's the neighbouring village of Tanworth-in-Arden. Here you can enjoy a circular walk around the grounds of the 17th century Umberslade Hall. The village itself is also worth exploring with its picturesque village green and 14th century church. The circular walk from neighbouring Bletchingley visits the lakes. It also visits the Moors Nature Reserve and Mercers Country Park to the north east. There's some pleasant lakeside trails and lots of wildlife to see in this area. Bletchingley is also worth exploring with a conservation area including several historic medieval properties. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks page."
