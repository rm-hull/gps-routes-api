It is a very quiet, relaxing spot, where you can either take in the views or go for walk around the lakes. The walks takes you through the woods where there are more hidden surprises. Bursting with wild life, you may catch a glimpse of a rare species, a migrant bird. An ideal nature reserve, easily accessed from either the M25 or M23, good free parking, with refreshment available."

  "description": "Enjoy a stroll along these three reservoirs and into the adjacent woodland on this lovely walk in Solihull . There's a good footpath running along the lakes which includes a visit to Terry's Pool.  This wildlife reserve, has a rich variety of plant and animal life including otters and turtles. Along the shore you'll see lots of pretty willow trees and plants such as great willowherb, betony, gipsywort and yellow flag iris.  The walk also takes you into the delightful Clowes Wood. Here you will find heathland, woodland, wildflowers and wet meadow. Look out for a variety of birdlife including jay, chiff chaff, nuthatch and treecreeper, woodcock and three types of woodpeckers.",
