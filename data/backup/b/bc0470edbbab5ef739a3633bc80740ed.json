  "description": "This circular walk in Droitwich visits the Worcester and Birmingham Canal and Hanbury Hall Park. There's much to enjoy with lovely countryside views, some moderate hill climbs, canalside paths, woodland, parkland and gardens. The walk starts at the car park near Hanbury Wharf, just to the east of Droitwich Spa. From here you pick up the Droitwich Canal and follow it east to where it meets with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. You then follow this north to Astwood Lane Bridge where you turn east to follow footpaths through the countryside to Piper's Hill. You then turn south to Hanbury Hill Church where you'll find the St Mary the Virgin church which dates from 1200. The grounds includes a viewpoint with a toposcope displaying all the sites you can see from the elevated position. This includes the Cotswolds, the Forest of Dean and the Malvern Hills. After taking in the views the route descends to Hanbury Hall. The 18th century hall is surrounded by beautiful gardens and parkland. There's also an orangery and a walled orchard containing a wide range of traditional English fruit varieties. The park is run by the National Trust so for a fee you can gain access to more walks around the hall. The final section of the walk runs from the hall to Lady Wood and Summer Hill before returning to the car park. To continue your walking in the area you could continue along the towpath of the Droitwich Canal. Following it west will take you through the town to Hawford where the canal joins with the River Severn.",

This will take you along the Worcestershire Canal and the Droitwich Canal before visiting the pleasant Lido Park in Droitwich Spa. Just to the west of Droitwich is the worthy village of Ombersley where you'll find a number of interesting timber framed properties, an ancient 15th century pub and the historic Ombersley House Estate. For more walking ideas in the area see the Worcestershire Walks page."
