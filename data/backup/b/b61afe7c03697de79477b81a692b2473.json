  "description": "This walk climbs to an Iron Age Hillfort and splendid viewpoint in Northumberland. The walk starts from the car park just to the west of the hill and just north of Hepburn Wood. From here you can follow a country lane east for about half a mile before following another footpath up to the hill top. The hill is the highest point of the Chillingham Hills which stretch from Alnwick to Berwick-upon-Tweed. It's a lovely spot with lots of pretty heather and extensive views to the Cheviots and Lindisfarne Castle and Holy Island on the coast. After taking in the views the route descends back to the car park on the same paths.",

      "content": "Head south from the car park and you can explore the woodland trails in Hepburn Woods. There's also the adjacent Hepburn Crags where there are more excellent views to enjoy. Head north and you can pay a visit to Chillingham Castle to extend your walking in the area. The 13th century castle is said to be the most haunted in Britain. It's surrounded by gardens, lakes and fountains with easy footpaths to explore on. You can find the castle just to the north west of the hill at postcode NE66 5NJ. From the hill top there are fine views over the estate and the wild cattle in the park.  Pictured above the nearby Chillingham Castle and Italian Gardens. The hill is not far from Alnwick where you could try the Alnwick to Bamburgh Walk and visit the historic Bamburgh castle on the coast. Wooler Common is also located a few miles to the north west and has some fine trails to try. The walk to Cateran Hole starts from the Hepburn woods car park. You can follow trails east to the unusual site where you'll find a series of steps leading down to a murky underground cave. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheviots Walks and Northumberland Walks pages."
