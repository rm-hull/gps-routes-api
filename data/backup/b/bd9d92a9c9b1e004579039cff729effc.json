  "description": "This walk visits the 18th century Bickleigh Mill in Devon. It's an interesting and scenic historical location surrounded by some attractive Devon countryside and the River Exe. The site was milling corn until the devastating floods of the 1960\u2019s and still includes mill workings and a water wheel. This circular walk explores the mill before heading into the surrounding countryside. The walk starts from the car park at the mill and heads north west to cross Bickleigh Bridge over the river. Here you can pick up the Exe Valley Way and follow the waymarked path south along country lanes to Bickleigh Castle and Taster's Wood. You continue south to Traymill Farm where you cross the river and continue north east along country lanes. You then head north west to continue to the car park. On the way you'll pass several maize mazes in a field near the village. The subjects include Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee, the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, the bicentenary of the birth of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and 100th anniversary of the Scouting movement.",
