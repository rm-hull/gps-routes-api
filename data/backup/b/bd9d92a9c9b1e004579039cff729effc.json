  "description": "This walk visits the 18th century Bickleigh Mill in Devon. It's an interesting and scenic historical location surrounded by some attractive Devon countryside and the River Exe. The site was milling corn until the devastating floods of the 1960\u2019s and still includes mill workings and a water wheel. This circular walk explores the mill before heading into the surrounding countryside. The walk starts from the car park at the mill and heads north west to cross Bickleigh Bridge over the river. Here you can pick up the Exe Valley Way and follow the waymarked path south along country lanes to Bickleigh Castle and Taster's Wood. You continue south to Traymill Farm where you cross the river and continue north east along country lanes. You then head north west to continue to the car park. On the way you'll pass several maize mazes in a field near the village. The subjects include Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee, the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, the bicentenary of the birth of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and 100th anniversary of the Scouting movement.",

      "content": "Head north along the Exe Valley way and it will take you into Tiverton where you can try the Tiverton Canal Walk. See the Tiverton to Bickleigh Walk for details of how to reach the site on foot from the town. It's about a 4 mile walk along the flat, signed path so can be done in a day. Head south along the Exe Valley Way and it will take you past Fursden House, Thorverton and Brampford Speke to Exteter. Here you can pick up the Exeter Canal Walk, the Exeter Green Circle and the Exeter Circular Walk. Just a few miles north east of the city there's the wonderful Killerton Park Estate to explore. The National Trust owned park covers thousands of acres with miles of great cycling and walking trails surrounding the 18th century mansion. The historic village of Broadclyst and the peaceful woodland trails around Ashclyst Forest can also be found in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
