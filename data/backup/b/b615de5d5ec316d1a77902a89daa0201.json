Present thinking is that these hilltop settlements were more in the nature of towns and villages than positions of defence against invaders. The area enclosed by the ramparts was usually large enough to hold a number of semi permanent dwellings and possibly some livestock, whereas a smaller area would have been much easier to defend."

  "description": "This village sits on the eastern edge of the city of Bath. There's some nice local river and canal walks plus a fine viewpoint just to the west of the settlement. This walk from the village visits some of the local highlights including the River Avon, the Kennet and Avon Canal Walk and Little Solsbury Hill. The walk starts in the village at the Batheaston Gardens and follows a section of the Limestone Link west along the river to the picturesque Bathampton Toll Bridge and Mill. You can then follow Mill Lane south to visit the canal at Bathampton. The route then retraces its steps before a climb to Little Solsbury Hill, made famous by the Peter Gabriel song 'Solsbury Hill'. There's fine views over the village and the surrounding countryside from this viewpoint.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area try the Bathampton Walk which visits the splendid American Museum at Claverton. Just to the east is the worthy village of Box. The village includes nice trails along the By Brook and the famous Box railway tunnel created by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in the early 19th century. Near here there's also Colerne where there's nearly 90 historic listed buildings including a 13th century church and a noteworthy 17th century stone pub. Just north east of the village you can pick up the Fosse Way. The trail follows the path of the ancient Roman Road north towards Culkerton. To the south east there's the worthy village of Monkton Farleigh where you can explore the attractive estate of the 18th century Monkton Farleigh Manor House. The circular walk also visits South Wraxall with its 15th century manor house. Just to the north west of the village you can climb to Bathford Hill and visit Brown's Folly. The 19th century tower is surrounded by a nature reserve with woodland, wildlife and countryside views.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Somerset Walks and the Cotswolds Walks pages."
