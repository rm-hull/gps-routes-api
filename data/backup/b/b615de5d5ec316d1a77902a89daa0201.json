Present thinking is that these hilltop settlements were more in the nature of towns and villages than positions of defence against invaders. The area enclosed by the ramparts was usually large enough to hold a number of semi permanent dwellings and possibly some livestock, whereas a smaller area would have been much easier to defend."

  "description": "This village sits on the eastern edge of the city of Bath. There's some nice local river and canal walks plus a fine viewpoint just to the west of the settlement. This walk from the village visits some of the local highlights including the River Avon, the Kennet and Avon Canal Walk and Little Solsbury Hill. The walk starts in the village at the Batheaston Gardens and follows a section of the Limestone Link west along the river to the picturesque Bathampton Toll Bridge and Mill. You can then follow Mill Lane south to visit the canal at Bathampton. The route then retraces its steps before a climb to Little Solsbury Hill, made famous by the Peter Gabriel song 'Solsbury Hill'. There's fine views over the village and the surrounding countryside from this viewpoint.",
