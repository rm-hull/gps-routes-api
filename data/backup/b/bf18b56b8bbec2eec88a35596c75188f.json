  "description": "These pretty woods near Daventry Country Park are a great place to see bluebells in the springtime. There's a good circular walking trail with ancient woodland including birch, sweet chestnut and sycamore. There's also nice views of the surrounding Northamptonshire countryside. You can park in the parking area off Stubbs Road where you can pick up the trails across the site. The Nene Way long distance trail passes just to the north of the woods. You could pick up the trail and follow it to Upper Weedon where it joins with the Grand Union Canal Walk. Just to the south of the woods in Farthingstone you can pick up the Macmillan Way and further explore the countryside.",
