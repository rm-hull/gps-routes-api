  "description": "These pretty woods near Daventry Country Park are a great place to see bluebells in the springtime. There's a good circular walking trail with ancient woodland including birch, sweet chestnut and sycamore. There's also nice views of the surrounding Northamptonshire countryside. You can park in the parking area off Stubbs Road where you can pick up the trails across the site. The Nene Way long distance trail passes just to the north of the woods. You could pick up the trail and follow it to Upper Weedon where it joins with the Grand Union Canal Walk. Just to the south of the woods in Farthingstone you can pick up the Macmillan Way and further explore the countryside.",

      "content": "Head into the nearby village and you could visit The Plough for some post walk refreshments. Reopening its doors in July 2023 after an extensive three and a half year hiatus, the pub's revival is a testament to the determination of the local community. A successful village campaign to save the pub culminated in the acquisition of a new private owner and the financial support of local investors, leading to a tasteful renovation. This refurbishment enhanced the pub's aesthetic appeal while preserving the character of the beautiful building. The pub now features three distinct areas. The main bar boasts a traditional wooden floor and bar stools, perfect for casual conversations. An adjacent room, designed with modern soft furnishings, offers a comfortable space that leads out to a spacious garden and the stable block, fondly referred to as the \"Furrow.\" The dining area, situated to the right of the bar, is adorned with half wooden panelling, giving it a classic yet refined feel. Patrons can enjoy two cask beers routinely on tap - one from the national brand of the Molson Coors portfolio, and the other typically a local brew, often sourced from the North Cotswold brewery.You can find them on the High Street at postcode NN11 3DT for your sat navs."

      "content": "Just to the south you could pick up the Knightley Way long distance footpath. If you follow it north west you'll find more peaceful woodland trails around Badby Woods. Near here there's also the historic Fawsley Hall where you can see a fine 15th century house surrounded by lakes, formal gardens and parkland landscaped by Capability Brown. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northamptonshire Walks page."
