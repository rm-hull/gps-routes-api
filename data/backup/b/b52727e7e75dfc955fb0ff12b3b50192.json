  "description": "This pretty village is located near Leyburn in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire. The settlement includes Constable Burton Hall, a grade-I-listed Georgian mansion dating back to 1768. This walk takes you around the lovely grounds which include beautiful gardens and views of the Burton Beck and surrounding Yorkshire Dales countryside. The hall gardens are open on certain days with more information on the link below. To continue your walking around the village head just a couple of miles south east to visit Thornton Steward Reservoir. There's some pleasant trails to follow around the small lake and a visit to Arklow Hill.",
