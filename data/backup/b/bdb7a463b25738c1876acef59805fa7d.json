The green mesh covered device is \"Archie\" an archimedean screw in reverse that uses falling water to turn a generator (normally a motor turns the screw to lift water). This supplies the local Co-operative store and was churning out 40 kW when seen."

  "description": "This special park in New Mills takes you through a beautiful river gorge with a fabulous 160 metre long walkway elevated over the water. From the walkway you can enjoy the rushing water below with waterfalls, weirs and interesting industrial buildings. The site is also home to the Torrs Hydro, a micro hydroelectric scheme which makes enough electricity to supply 70 homes.  The park is located in the town centre and can be easily reached from New Mills Central train station. There are other paths on both sides of the river which allow you to turn it into a longer Millennium Walkway circular walk. If you would like to extend your walking in New Mills then you could continue along the Goyt Way . The route runs along the River Goyt and the Peak Forest Canal to the nearby Whaley Bridge . Also nearby is the wonderful Lyme Park with miles of cycling and walking trails set in a beautiful deer park.",
