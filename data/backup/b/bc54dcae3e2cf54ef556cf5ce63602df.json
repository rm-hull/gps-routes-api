  "description": "This 13th century castle near Drumoak has some lovely walking trails to follow through the grounds and surrounding woodland. To the east of the castle you can try the farmland walk, while on the western side the Drumhill trail will take you through the Forest of Drum. In the grounds you can visit the delightful Garden of Historic Roses and an arboretum containing trees from all regions of the 18th century British Empire. There's also little Robbie Rossie's Loch which lies just to the east of the castle. The site is owned by the National Trust for Scotland who provide tours of the castle. Here you can see the medieval High Hall and the original charter sealed by Robert the Bruce. You can also visit the fabulous old library and climb the 700-year-old tower for wonderful views over the surrounding countryside. To continue your walking in the area you could head west to Banchory and visit the splendid Crathes Castle. There's 600 acres of formal gardens, woodland and rolling countryside to explore on a number of footpaths. Also in Banchory you can visit the wonderful Falls of Feugh where you can watch the salmon leaping up the cascade. To the north you will find Kirkhill Forest. There's miles of good waymarked trails with hill climbs and great viewpoints to be found here. The Loch of Skene can also be found just to the north. It's a lovely peaceful place for birdwatching and easy strolls.",

      "content": "Head north west of the castle and you can visit the ancient Whitehills Stone Circle on the Pitfichie Forest Walk. Near here you'll find a historic local highlight at the National Trust's Castle Fraser in Inverurie. The stunning 15th century castle is surrounded by some beautiful gardens and landscaped grounds. A little further west there's more local history at the 16th century Craigievar Castle. Here you can explore the attractive grounds of a pink fairytale castle, thought to have been the inspiration for Walt Disney\u2019s Cinderella Castle."
