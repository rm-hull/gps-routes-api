  "description": "Explore the 'home' of Winnie-the-Pooh in this large area of woodland and heathland near Crowborough. The expansive forest has miles of good footpaths to try. This route makes use of the Wealdway long distance footpath which runs through the woods from south to north. There are car parks near Duddleswell which give direct access to the forest paths. You then head north passing Camp Hill and Wren's Warren before finishing at Five Hundred Acre Wood. Hundred Acre Wood in the Pooh stories is based on this area. From here you can return the same way or continue north to the nearby village of Hartfield for refreshments. The forest consists of open heathland, woodland trails and a series of hills where you can enjoy splendid views over the Weald to the chalk escarpments of the North Downs and South Downs. The area is great for wildlife. Look out for several species of deer including roe, muntjac and sika deer. Keen eyed birdwatchers can spot Dartford warbler, yellowhammer and stonechat. There's also a wide variety of flora to look out for with Oak and Beech Woods, interesting vegetation around the streams and ponds and a variety of heathland plants and flowers. Ashdown Forest is well known as the setting for the Winnie-the-Pooh stories by A. A. Milne, who lived on the northern edge of Ashdown forest. The illustrations in the Pooh books are based on areas of the woods you will see on this walk. You can visit the A.A Milne memorial and some other sites from the stories on our Pooh Walk from Gills Lap. Near here at Chuck Hatch you can try the short stroll to Pooh Sticks Bridge. It's thought to be the location where authour A.A Milne and his son first played the game which appears in the book 'The House at Pooh Corner'. You can also visit the area from Hartfield village (home of A.A Milne) on our Hartfield Winnie the Pooh Walk. This route is designed for walkers but the area is also very popular with cyclists. You could start your ride from the same start point as this walk and then follow the country lanes through the forest. See the link below for more details or download one of the maps below for all the tracks, lanes and routes in the area. The long distance Vanguard Way also runs right through the forest. You could pick it up and head north west towards Forest Row to extend your walk. Following it south will take you towards Buxted.",
