  "description": "This circular walk explores the countryside and villages around Downe. On the route you will explore the countryside and woods where Charles Darwin observed the natural world, helping him cultivate his now world famous theories. The walk starts at Down House where Darwin resided. The English Heritage owned house is now an interactive museum where you can learn all about his theories of evolution by natural selection. From the house you head north into the village of Downe before turning north east into the countryside and farmland. The trail heads east through Cuckoo Wood and Hazelwood before coming to Foxbury Wood. Here you head south west past Mace Farm to the neighbouring village of Cudham. From Cudham you head west through Single Street before turning north to follow a footpath along the West Kent Golf Club. You then head north east and then south to return to the village and Down House.",
