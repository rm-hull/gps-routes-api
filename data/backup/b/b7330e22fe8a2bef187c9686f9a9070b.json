  "description": "Visit the most popular paid entry garden in the UK on this walk in Greater London. Kew has a series of well laid out footpaths running for several miles around the expansive site. It has the world's largest collection of living plants with a herbarium which has over seven million preserved plant specimens. Highlights include the fantastic Treetop walkway which takes you into the tree canopy of the Kew woodland. The Sackler Crossing bridge across the large lake and the wonderful Bamboo Garden are also must sees. You can virtually explore the gardens using the street view link below! The gardens are located on the River Thames so you could extend your walk by picking up the Thames Path and heading towards nearby Richmond or Chiswick . Here you will find the splendid Marble Hill Park . Syon Park is also just opposite and is another good option.",
