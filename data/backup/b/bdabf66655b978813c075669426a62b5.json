  "description": "This walk takes you around the grounds of the National Trust owned Wray Castle and then up to the nearby Blelham Tarn. The Mock-Gothic castle is located on the shores of Lake Windermere so the trail includes a lovely waterside section at the start. The grounds also include pretty gardens and woodland with a tree trail which is great for children. After leaving the grounds this walk involves a short climb through delightful countryside to the pretty Blelham Tarn. The trail runs around the tarn and then gently descends to the finish point back at the castle. If you would like to continue your walk you could pick up the Windermere Way and continue around this fabulous lake. Our Wray Castle to Ferry House Walk will take you from the castle, along the lake to the Ferry House, about 4 miles to the south. Here you can catch the passenger ferry to Bowness.",
