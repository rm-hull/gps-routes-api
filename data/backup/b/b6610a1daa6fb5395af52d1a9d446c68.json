It is the longest of all Pictish inscriptions, and like most Pictish inscriptions, is written in the Ogham alphabet. It is a scheduled ancient monument. The Picts were a group of peoples who lived in Britain north of the Forth\u2013Clyde isthmus in the Pre-Viking, Early Middle Ages"

  "description": "This historic 16th century castle is located near Forres, in Moray. The castle is run by the National Trust for Scotland and includes some lovely grounds with 400 varieties of daffodil. There's also some wonderful large scupltures including the Brodie Bunny and some very fine Unicorns. You can enjoy a stroll around the woodland trails, lovely gardens and enjoy excellent views of the surrounding Moray countryside. At the western end there's also a lake which attracts a variety of wildfowl. To continue your walking in the area you could head east to Forres and pick up the Moray Coast Trail . The Forres To Findhorn is the opening section which takes you along the wildlife rich Findhorn Bay. The Dava Way walking and cycling trail can also be picked up here.",
