  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Rhaeadr Nantcol Waterfalls in Snowdonia in North Wales. The falls are located along the River Cwmnantcol in the county of Gwynedd, near the settlements of Llanbedr and Harlech on the coast. You can start your walk from the car park at the campsite. From here you pick up the riverside walk heading south to the picturesque falls. The route then loops round through peaceful woodlands before returning to the campsite. You then have the option of extending the walk by heading west to visit a small reservoir where you will find another circular path. There's a pleasant picnic area by the campsite where you can enjoy a rest and some refreshment after your exercise.",
