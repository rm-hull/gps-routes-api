  "description": "Enjoy a short walk to Wye Crown in the beautiful Wye Downs. The hill figure is one of the landmarks of the area and a great spot to enjoy views over the Kent Downs AONB. The circular walk starts in the village of Wye just to the west of the Downs. You can pick up the North Downs Way and follow the waymarked trail east to the Wye Crown. It's just over a one mile walk from the village to the site, where you will find the white hill figure carved in the chalk by students in 1902 to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII. The Crown is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) surrounded by rare downland herbs, orchids and butterflies. There's also the Wye Crown Millennium Stone where you can stand and enjoy fine views back down to the village and over the countryside of the Kent Downs. The route then continues south along the Downs before descending to Armage Farm. Across the downs look out for a variety of pretty wildflowers in the summer months. The final section follows other public footpaths west below the Downs to take you back through the countryside to Wye.",
