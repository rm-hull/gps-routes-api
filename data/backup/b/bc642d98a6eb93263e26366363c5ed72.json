  "description": "This walk explores Micheldever Woods near Basingstoke and Winchester. The woods are a lovely place for a peaceful stroll with the pretty bluebells in the spring a major attraction to the site. They are also particularly lovely in the autumn months when the leaves start to change colour. You can start your walk from the car park at the southern end of the woods, just off Northington Lane. It's located a couple of miles south east of Micheldever village. From here pick up the trails heading north into the woods where there are hundreds of acres to explore. You can extend the walk by heading into the adjacent Dodsley Wood to the north east or Itchen Wood to the south.",
