  "description": "This walk explores Micheldever Woods near Basingstoke and Winchester. The woods are a lovely place for a peaceful stroll with the pretty bluebells in the spring a major attraction to the site. They are also particularly lovely in the autumn months when the leaves start to change colour. You can start your walk from the car park at the southern end of the woods, just off Northington Lane. It's located a couple of miles south east of Micheldever village. From here pick up the trails heading north into the woods where there are hundreds of acres to explore. You can extend the walk by heading into the adjacent Dodsley Wood to the north east or Itchen Wood to the south.",

      "content": "Micheldever village is located just to the north west of the woods. The pretty village is worth exploring with its old church and picturesque thatched cottages. To continue your woodland walking in the area head a few miles north to Blackwood Forest. The expansive woods include some fine mountain bike trails and numerous footpaths. Just to the south there's the village of Itchen Abbas where there are nice riverside trails along the Itchen Way. On the southern side of nearby Basingstoke there's the historic area of Old Basing. Here you'll find the 16th century Basing House, a Tudor Tithe Barn, Basingstoke Common and the Basing Lime Pits. There's also some more nice trails along the River Loddon in this area. Just south of Old Basing there's also Hackwood Park to explore. The Grade I listed park has a series of public footpaths taking you past the old estate which includes an ornamental bridge, fountains, a statue of George I, deer and the impressive Hackwood House. Just to the east of the park you can pick up the circular Mapledurwell Walk and visit the pretty villages of Mapledurwell and Upton Grey. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
