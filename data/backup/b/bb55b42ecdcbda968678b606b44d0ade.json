  "description": "This walk visits the town of Moffat in Dumfries and Galloway. The route takes you along the River Annan which flows to the west of the settlement. It uses a section of the Annandale Way , a 90-kilometre (56 mi) hiking trail, which is officially designated by NatureScot as one of Scotland's Great Trails. You can start the walk in Station Park and stroll down to the river, passing the boating lake on the way. You then pick up the riverside path and follow it north past Annan Bridge, Hope Johnstone Park and Lawrencefield. It's a pleasant flat trail part of which runs along Dr Wattie's Walk. To continue your walking around Moffat head south to pick up the Romans and Reivers Route . The long distance route follows the old Roman Roads from the Ae Forest to Hawick. Following the trail west will take you to the nearby Ae Forest where you can enjoy miles of walking and cycling trails. The route is coincident with the Southern Upland Way which can also be picked up to the south and used to further explore the surrounding countryside and woodland. One nice idea is to follow the trail west to visit Daer Reservoir where there are some more nice waterside trails.",
