  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Weets Hill from Barnoldswick near the edge of the Forest of Bowland AONB. It's a moderate climb, rising to a height of over 1300ft so a good level of fitness is required. The hill is in a great position, close to Pendle, the Forest of Bowland and the Yorkshire Dales. As such the summit makes an excellent vantage point. The walk starts in Wapping on the western side of Barnoldswick where you can pick up the Pendle Way. Follow the waymarked trail south west along Folly Lane and it will take you towards Weets Hill. You can branch off from the lane to climb to the summit which stands at a height of 397 m (1,302 ft). At the peak you will find a Triangulation Pillar and fine views over much of east Lancashire, the north Ribble Valley, north Aire Valley and the Yorkshire Dales. After taking in the views the route descends to Weets House before turning south along the Gisburn Old Road. The route then turns north to follow the Lister Well Road back into Barnoldswick.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you could try the Barnoldswick Canal Walk which will take you along a pleasant section of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. If you head south along the canal you can visit Foulridge Reservoir in Colne where there's a nice trail running around the perimeter of the water. To the west of the reservoir there's an interesting monument and viewpoint in the shape of the 19th century Blacko Tower, located just north of the village of Blacko. The long distance Pendle Way can also be picked up here. Just to the east of Barnoldswick are the villages of Thornton-in-Craven and Elslack where you can enjoy a peaceful walk around Elslack Reservoir. There's also a fine 17th century pub in Elslack village which is well worth a visit. Just to the east is neighbouring Earby where you can visit the delightful Earby Waterfalls on the Wencliffe Brook. For more walking ideas in the area see the Forest of Bowland Walks page."
