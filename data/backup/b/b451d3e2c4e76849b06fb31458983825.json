  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Weets Hill from Barnoldswick near the edge of the Forest of Bowland AONB. It's a moderate climb, rising to a height of over 1300ft so a good level of fitness is required. The hill is in a great position, close to Pendle, the Forest of Bowland and the Yorkshire Dales. As such the summit makes an excellent vantage point. The walk starts in Wapping on the western side of Barnoldswick where you can pick up the Pendle Way . Follow the waymarked trail south west along Folly Lane and it will take you towards Weets Hill. You can branch off from the lane to climb to the summit which stands at a height of 397\u00a0m (1,302\u00a0ft). At the peak you will find a\u00a0Triangulation Pillar\u00a0and fine views over much of east Lancashire, the north\u00a0Ribble Valley, north\u00a0Aire Valley\u00a0and the\u00a0Yorkshire Dales. After taking in the views the route descends to Weets House before turning south along the Gisburn Old Road. The route then turns north to follow the Lister Well Road back into Barnoldswick.",
