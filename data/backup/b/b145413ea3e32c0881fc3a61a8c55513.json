It is notable as one of the smallest towns in Shropshire, and was granted its\u00a0market charter\u00a0in 1253. This circular walk from the town takes you north to Ron Hill and Neen Savage, following the route of the River Rea. The route then returns on bridle tracks just to the east of the river. The route runs for about 2 miles on fairly flat paths with nice river and country views on the way.",
