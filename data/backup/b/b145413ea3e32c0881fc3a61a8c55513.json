  "description": "This picturesque market town in Shropshire has some pleasant walks along the River Rea. It is notable as one of the smallest towns in Shropshire, and was granted its market charter in 1253. This circular walk from the town takes you north to Ron Hill and Neen Savage, following the route of the River Rea. The route then returns on bridle tracks just to the east of the river. The route runs for about 2 miles on fairly flat paths with nice river and country views on the way.",

Also to the east you can pick up the Severn Way and enjoy riverside walk around Bewdley and Stourport. The waymarked Ribbesford Circular Walk can also be picked up in this area. The Clee Hills are also nearby and provide some more challenging walking opportunities. The epic Jack Mytton Way passes the village. The shared cycling and walking route runs along a bridleway through the Shropshire Hills, visiting several of the highlights. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Walks page."
