  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Durleigh Reservoir in Bridgwater , Somerset. The walk starts in the small village of Durleigh, located on the western fringes of the town of Bridgwater. From here you can pick up a mixture of country lanes and public footpaths to take you around the water. It's about a 2 mile walk on flat paths, so suitable for most abilities. On the way look out for a variety of water loving birds including ducks, great crested grebes, swans and geese. There is a sailing club located at the site so you may see sailboats on the water in decent weather. It's also a popular spot for anglers looking to catch carp, roach, bream, perch, tench and pike. The Durleigh Brook feeds into the reservoir so you can continue your walk by heading east along the footpath that runs along the brook. A short distance south of the reservoir you can pick up the Samaritans Way South West . This waymarked trail will take you into the countryside around Goathurst if you follow it west. Head east and it will take you into Bridgwater where you could pick up the towpath of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal .",
