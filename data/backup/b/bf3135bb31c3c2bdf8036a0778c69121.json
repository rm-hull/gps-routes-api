  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Durleigh Reservoir in Bridgwater, Somerset. The walk starts in the small village of Durleigh, located on the western fringes of the town of Bridgwater. From here you can pick up a mixture of country lanes and public footpaths to take you around the water. It's about a 2 mile walk on flat paths, so suitable for most abilities. On the way look out for a variety of water loving birds including ducks, great crested grebes, swans and geese. There is a sailing club located at the site so you may see sailboats on the water in decent weather. It's also a popular spot for anglers looking to catch carp, roach, bream, perch, tench and pike. The Durleigh Brook feeds into the reservoir so you can continue your walk by heading east along the footpath that runs along the brook. A short distance south of the reservoir you can pick up the Samaritans Way South West. This waymarked trail will take you into the countryside around Goathurst if you follow it west. Head east and it will take you into Bridgwater where you could pick up the towpath of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal .",

      "content": "West India House pub is located just east of the lake. Constructed in 1936, the building stands on a site that has historically housed a pub in various forms for many years. The name 'West India House' harks back to the days when Bridgwater was a thriving port. The location is thought to have originally been owned by a merchant from the West India Trading Company, whose ships brought goods to the town's quayside. West India House features a fully-equipped skittle alley/function room, which includes its own dedicated bar. Additionally, there's a spacious and picturesque beer garden at the back, offering scenic views of the surrounding countryside. For those seeking a relaxed atmosphere, the lounge bar offers a cosy environment with an open log fire. Alternatively, the saloon bar provides a more dynamic setting, recently extended and updated with modern decor. Both bars are equipped with large flatscreen TVs for broadcasting major live sports events. The saloon bar also houses a high-quality jukebox with a blend of classic and contemporary tunes, a games machine, and a dartboard. You can find them at 101 Durleigh Road with postcode TA6 7JE for your sat navs. The pub is dog friendly."

      "content": "In the village you'll pass the noteworthy West Bower Manor. Parts of the historic building date from the 15th century though the core of the fabric may even be earlier, further parts were built in the 17th and 19th centuries. It was the seat of the historical estate of \"West Bower\" once held by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, the brother of Jane Seymour, Henry the VIII`s Queen. There's also the Church of St Hugh which dates from the 11th century and was substantially rebuilt in the late 19th century. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building."
