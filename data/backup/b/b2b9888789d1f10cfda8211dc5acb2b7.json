  "description": "This circular walk explores the Acres Down area of the New Forest near the village of Minstead . On the way you'll enjoy the woodland trails and streams of the Highland Water Inclosure before paying a visit to the nearby Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary . The walk starts at the Acres Down car park which is located just south west of Minstead, near to the Acres Down Farm . There's a campsite, working farm and a nice cafe to visit here. From the car park head south west past Wick Wood and into the Highland Water Inclosure. The trail continues past Woolsmoor Meads before coming to the lovely Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary. There's a splendid viewpoint here where you can observe the herd of fallow deer. The route then heads east to Coneygeer Bottom before turning north to the Canadian War Memorial and Mogshade Hill. From here you head east to Stonyard Wood and Hart Hill where you will find a triangulation pillar. The route then heads along Ringwood Ford Bottom before returning to the car park.",
