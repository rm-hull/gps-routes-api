  "description": "This walk visits a series of beautiful waterfalls on the River Caerfanell near Talybont Reservoir in the Brecon Beacons. The walk starts from the Forestry Comission's Upper Blaen-y-Glyn car park and takes you to Lower Blaen-y-Gly. You'll pass along woodland paths with several pretty falls to enjoy. There is also a picnic area and the opportunity to turn it into a circular walk using alternative woodland trails. If you'd like to extend your walk you could pick up the Taff Trail and follow it to the nearby Talybont Reservoir. The Fan Y Big and the Cribyn mountain climb also starts from the same point.",
