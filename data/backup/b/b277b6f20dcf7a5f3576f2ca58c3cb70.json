  "description": "Follow the long woodland trail through Laughton Woods on this easy walk in Lincolnshire. You can park at the car park at Tuetoes Wood and then follow a footpath through Laughton Forest to the nearby village of Scotten. The path passes Scotton Common Nature Reserve and Green Howe Pond. Look out for wildlife such as herons and nightjars in the woods. Laughton Woods is located about 7 miles south of Scunthorpe. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Messingham Sand Quarry where there are nice footpaths running around a series of lagoons. Also nearby is the lovely Twigmoor Woods with its large ponds and lovely colourful rhododendrons.",
