The canal has long since gone but the railway track bed still exists. To the south the track is now a pleasant multi-user trail to Alton. To the northwest the it connects to the Churnet Valley preserved railway with the prospect that one day the line might be extended once more into the village."

  "description": "The pretty Staffordshire village of Oakamoor makes a great base for exploring the beautiful Churnet Valley. This circular walk makes use of the Staffordshire Moorlands Way and the Staffordshire Way to explore the wooded valleys surrounding the village. You'll first visit the lovely Dimmingsdale where there's a waymarked trail to follow along a series of streams and pools. The route then heads to the National Trust's Hawksmoor Wood Nature Reserve. The ancient woodland is located just to the west of the village and is a great place for wild flowers and wildlife spotting. On the walk you'll enjoy nice views of the River Churnet and miles of peaceful woodland trails. The area looks particularly stunning in the autumn months. To explore the Churnet Valley further head north to Froghall on the Staffordshire Way and you can pick up the towpath of the Caldon Canal. You could also visit the nearby village of Alton, home to the famous Alton Towers and the interesting Alton Castle.",
