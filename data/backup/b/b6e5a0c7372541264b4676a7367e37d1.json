  "description": "This Buckinghamshire based village is well served by a series of footpaths running into the glorious rolling Chilterns countryside. This figure of eight loop walk takes you to some of the walking highlights of the area. The route starts from the train station and first heads south to visit the National Trust's West Wycombe Park where there's lakes, parkland and gardens surrounding a historic mansion. You then turn north to explore the expansive Bradenham Woods where you'll find miles of peaceful woodland walks. The northern section of the loop takes you to the woodland and viewpoints at Chinnor Hill which lies a few miles north west of the settlement. In this area you can pick up The Ridgeway National Trail. The final section visits the neighbouring village of Bledlow Ridge which lies just a mile west of the train station.",
