The lower is a local road going to Batheaston via a toll bridge over the River Avon.\nThe hill to the right is the bottom of Lansdown hill, and the countryside between is north Somerset looking toward Farmborough and Pensford."

ST7667\nMoving left we can see the northern end of Lansdown, where the battle of Lansdown was fought in 1643. Lansdown Hill continues to the edge of the picture. To the right of Freezing Hill part of Charmy Down appears, there is a disused airfield at the top which is still put to good use by model aeroplane and glider enthusiasts.\nAbout half way down we have part of Batheaston, the railway line out of Bath and the Batheaston bypass are almost hidden by the trees at the bottom."

  "description": "This walk visits Brown's Folly near Bathford and Monkton Farleigh on the Somerset/Wiltshire border. The 19th century tower is surrounded by a nature reserve with woodland, wildlife and countryside views. There is a public car park just below the tower where you can start the walk. The route then takes you along Bathford Hill where you can enjoy some wonderful views over the surrounding countryside and the nearby city of Bath. The surrounding reserve includes flower-rich grasslands, ancient woodland and the remains of old Bath stone quarries.",
