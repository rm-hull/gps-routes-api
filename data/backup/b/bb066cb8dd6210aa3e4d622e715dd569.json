  "description": "This lovely cycle or walk takes you along a disused railway line with its series of charming stations. Starting in the historic city of Bristol you will pass through Staple Hill, Mangotsfield and then Warmley where the station platform contains a cafe - perfect for a stop for refreshments. The route then takes you along the Avon Valley Railway and past Bitton railway station which also has a cafe. The final delightful section takes you along the River Avon and into the historic city of Bath. To extend the ride you can pick up the Kennet and Avon Canal in Bath. There's more easy cycling to be enjoyed along the flat towpath here. See the Bristol Cycle Routes page for more cycling ideas in and around the city.",

There are also outdoor seating areas which include the gardens, summerhouse and on the platform itself. They serve substantial meals and some particularly delicious home made cakes. You can find the cafe at roughly the half way point on the route at a postcode of BS30 5JB for your sat navs."

      "content": "To the west of Bath you will pass close to the village of Newton St Loe. The pretty village is worth a small detour from the route if you have time. It includes the attractive Newton College and Newton Park where there's an 18th-century landscaped garden, designed by the famous landscape gardener Capability Brown. There's also a historic 18th century country house and a fine 17th century pub to see too. Just to the east of the path at Saltford you'll find the little village of Kelston where you can pick up the Kelston Roundhill Walk. This popular walk takes you up to an ancient barrow where there are wonderful views to the Wiltshire Downs, the Mendip Hills and the Black Mountains of Wales. In Bristol there's the Bristol Triangular City Walk and the Bristol Circular River Walk to explore the city's highlights including the wonderful Blaise Castle Estate. The Avon Cycleway uses the path. The long distance circular ride explores the area around Bristol, visiting the edge of the Cotswolds and the coast around Clevedon. The Great Western Way starts at Bristol Temple Meads Railway station and uses the path. The trail runs from Bristol to London following the route of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's 19th century railway. It finishes at Southwark's Brunel Museum, where you can learn all about the life and works of the famous engineer."
