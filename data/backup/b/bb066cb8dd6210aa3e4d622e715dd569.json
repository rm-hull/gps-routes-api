    "description": "This lovely cycle or walk takes you along a disused railway line with its series of charming stations. Starting in the historic city of Bristol you will pass through Staple Hill, Mangotsfield and then Warmley where the station platform contains a cafe - perfect for a stop for refreshments. The route then takes you along the Avon Valley Railway and past Bitton railway station which also has a cafe. The final delightful section takes you along the River Avon and into the historic city of Bath. To extend the ride you can pick up the Kennet and Avon Canal in Bath. There's more easy cycling to be enjoyed along the flat towpath here. See the Bristol Cycle Routes page for more cycling ideas in and around the city.",
