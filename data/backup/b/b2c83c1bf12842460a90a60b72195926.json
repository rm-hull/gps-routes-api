  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk around this stunning glacial lake in the Snowdonia National Park. Also known as Llyn Mwyngil, the lake is situated at the foot of the imposing Cadair Idris the second highest mountain in Wales. There is a lovely walking trail along the northern end of the lake which will take you from Tal-y-llyn to Dol-ffanog. At the south western end of the lake you will find a lakeside hotel where you can get a Welsh cream tea and other refreshments. To extend your lakeside walking try the climb to the stunning Llyn Cau .",
