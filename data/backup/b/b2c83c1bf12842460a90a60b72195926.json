Also known as Llyn Mwyngil, the lake is situated at the foot of the imposing Cadair Idris the second highest mountain in Wales. There is a lovely walking trail along the northern end of the lake which will take you from Tal-y-llyn to Dol-ffanog. At the south western end of the lake you will find a lakeside hotel where you can get a Welsh cream tea and other refreshments.

      "content": "Just a few miles to the west there's a real gem at Dolgoch Falls. You can follow a wooden walkway to the woodland ravine where you'll find the magical falls. The splendid Talyllyn Railway can also be picked up in this area. The heritage railway will take you to the coast at Tywyn where there is a lovely long beach, sand dunes, a large lake and views of the River Dysynni.  To the south there's the worthy village of Abergynolwyn to visit. The historic settlement is located on the heritage Talyllyn Railway and includes pleasant trails along the Nant Gwernol waterfalls to the old Bryn Eglwys Quarry. Near here you can also explore the substantial mediaeval remains of the 13th century Castell Y Bere.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
