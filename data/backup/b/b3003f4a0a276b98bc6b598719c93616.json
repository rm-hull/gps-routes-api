  "description": "This Warwickshire based village is located just south of the county town of Warwick. It's a pleasant place to start a walk with a fine local pub and a noteworthy 14th century church to see. There are also nice views of the River Avon from Barford Bridge on the northern side of the village. This walk from Barford takes you to the nearby Oakley Wood. You can follow pleasant country lanes through the countryside to the peaceful woods which lie just to the south east. The wood includes a number of footpaths taking you through attractive ancient woodland. The site includes lots of bluebells and wildflowers in the spring and summer months.
