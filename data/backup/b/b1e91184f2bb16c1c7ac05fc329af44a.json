  "description": "The Northamptonshire town of Brackley lies on the on the borders with Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. The market town is close to the famous Silverstone racing track and includes a noteworthy Parish church with parts dating from the 11th century. This circular walk from the town takes you through the countryside to the National Trust's Stowe Park. The route runs for just over 11 miles, exploring the farmland, woodland and villages to the east of the town before skirting the edge of the historic park. The walk starts to the east of the town centre and follows country paths east towards Turweston. Here you pick up the waymarked Westbury Circular Ride, a shared cycling and walking footpath running through the area. The path will take you along Ash Furlong Lane and through Westbury Wild Woods before coming to Wood Green. Here you can follow other public footpaths south east to reach the edge of the lovely Stowe Park. You then head along the edge of the park and across Oxford Water on the interesting old stone bridge. The paths then head west to Shalstone before passing the village of Westbury. Soon after you pass Oatley's Farm before returning to Turweston and Brackley.",
