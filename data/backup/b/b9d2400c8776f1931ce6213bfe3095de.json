  "description": "This Norfolk seaside town is the gateway from the Norfolk Broads to the North Sea. There's lovely coastal walks and long distance trails which you can pick up from the town and follow into the Norfolk Broads. This walk follows the Angles Way along Breydon Water to the Roman Fort at Burgh Castle. The walk starts on the seafront next to the Britannia Pier. The town's attracttions include the Pleasure Beach, the Sea Life Centre, the Hippodrome Circus and the Time and Tide Museum, as well as the UK's only surviving Victorian seaside cast iron and glass Winter Garden. From the front you can pick up the waymarked Angles Way footpath and follow it west through the town to Haven Bridge, where you cross the River Yare. You then pass through Cobholm Island before following the path along Breydon Water. The expansive estuary is also a nature reserve with a huge number of wading birds to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for golden plovers, wigeons, lapwings and tens of thousands of Bewick's swans. After a few miles you will come to the noteworthy Burgh Castle which is another highlight of the area. The interesting Roman fort dates from the 3rd century and still has some of its thick walls in tact. The site sits next to the River Waveney so you can enjoy more waterside trails here. To extend your walk continue along the Angles Way south to visit Fritton Lake Country Park. Here you'll find lovely cycling and walking paths around the large lake which is 2.5 miles long. The lake is surrounded by peaceful woods where there are nice shady trails to try. To continue your walking in Great Yarmouth town, pick up the Weavers' Way and follow it along the other side of Breydon Water to Halvergate. If you head south along the coast you can visit Gorleston-on-Sea, Hopton-on-Sea and the Suffolk town of Lowestoft. Here you can visit the lovely Oulton Broad and Carlton Marshes where there's more nice trails and a large variety of wildlife to look out for. The Wherryman's Way long distance trail also starts in the town. The waymarked trail will take you through a number of pretty Norfolk Broads villages to Norwich. Somerleyton is another walking highlight of the area. The delightful model village includes thatched red-brick estate cottages and the splendid Somerleyton Hall with its beautiful gardens and expansive estate. The River Bure also runs through the town. You could pick it up and head west to the picturesque village of Acle and try our Acle and the River Bure Circular Walk .",
