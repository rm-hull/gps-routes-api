  "description": "This large nature reserve in Aviemore has a number of splendid walking trails to try. In the reserve you can enjoy several small lochs, woodland trails and stunning views of the Cairngorms. You can follow the easier waymarked trails around the lochs before climbing to wonderful viewpoints. From here there are great views over Aviemore and towards Cairn Gorm. The area is also good for wildlife watching - look out for peregrine falcons on the rocky crags. The reserve is easy to reach, located close to the centre of Aviemore and the train station.",
