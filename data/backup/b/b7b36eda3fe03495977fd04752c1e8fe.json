      "caption": "Sinnington village green and phonebox. Sinnington is known for its medieval cruck-built longhouses, a distinct architectural style typical of the area. These longhouses were historically used as combined dwelling and livestock housing, and they were primarily constructed using the local Jurassic limestone. Originally, these structures featured ling thatched roofs, but during the 19th century, many of them were re-roofed with either grey slate or red pantiles. These unique longhouses are a testament to the historical construction methods and materials used in the region."

      "caption": "All Saints' Church in Sinnington holds an interesting historical feature within its architecture. The church contains an assemblage of numerous fragments of pre-Norman crosses and hogback fragments, which are scattered throughout the building, both inside and outside. This intriguing collection suggests that a significant number of crosses, possibly even reaching double figures, were deliberately dismantled to provide building stones for the construction of the twelfth-century church. This unique incorporation of historical artifacts into the church's structure adds to its cultural and historical significance."
