  "description": "This walk takes you around the Oughtonhead Common Nature Reserve in Hitchin. There's some nice trails along the River Oughton, pockets of woodland, meadows and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Keep your eyes peeled for kingfishers on the river and the Orange Tip butterflies around the pretty wildflower meadows in the warmer months. It's a lovely peaceful place for a stroll with plenty of benches to sit and relax on too. You can start the walk from the car park on the eastern side of the common at the Swinbourne Avenue playing fields. Then head west and then north to meet up with the riverside trails. To extend your walk you could pick up the Icknield Way Path and follow it north west to visit the nearby village of Pirton.",

The Ickleford Walk visits the reserve from the nearby village before heading to Pirton. The reserve is also located very close to Letchworth where you can try the circular Letchworth Walk. This uses a section of the epic Icknield Way Path to visit the town's Norton Common and the nearby villages of Ickleford and Pirton.
