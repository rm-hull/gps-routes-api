  "description": "The Killerton Estate is 6,400 acres of parkland and countryside containing over 60 miles of footpaths and cycle tracks. It is located near Broadclyst in the Exeter region of Devon. The estate also contains a beautiful landscaped garden with rhododendrons, magnolias and rare trees surrounded by rolling Devon countryside. The walk also passes Killerton House - an 18th-century house with a marvellous collection of 18th- to 20th-century costumes. The route below is devised for walkers but there is also cycle track at Killerton. It is great for families and follows a safe circular route around the beautiful parkland at Killerton, starting and finishing at Killerton's stable-block. Please click here to download the gpx file for the Kilerton Park cycle route (it follows a similar path to the walk). If you'd like to continue your exercise then you could head a couple of miles east to Ashclyst Forest where there are more cycling and walking tracks to try. On the northern end of the estate you will find the Ellerhayes Bridge and the River Culm Walk. There's another small car park here next to the photogenic 15th century bridge. You can park here and enjoy a stroll along the River Culm with more lovely views to enjoy.",

      "content": "Just to the west there's the village of Brampford Speke and the picturesque Bickleigh Mill to visit. The site is a fine place for an easy stroll with a historic mill and shopping area right next to the river. There's also an excellent riverside pub here too. The Two Counties Way passes through the park. The long distance trail takes you to some of the highlights of Devon and Somerset including the Grand Western Canal and the historic Powderham Castle. The circular Broadclyst Walk explores the estate from the nearby village. The historic settlement is well worth a visit with an historic watermill, a 15th century church and a 16th century pub to see. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
