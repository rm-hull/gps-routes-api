  "description": "This pretty reservoir near Sheffield has waterside paths to follow around the perimeter. There is also the opportunity to climb into the woodlands and countryside around the reservoir. The circuit runs for about 4 miles through Bradfield Dale and along the adjacent Strines Reservoir . Dale Dike is part of series of reservoirs in the area. You can also visit Damflask Reservoir and Agden Reservoir for more good walking trails and beautiful Peak District scenery. You can also climb west to Derwent Edge and Back Tor for great views back down to the surrounding reservoirs.",
