The village includes a number of timber-framed and chequered brick houses, of special interest being the 18th-century Pond House and the half-timbered Taverners Place (formerly used as a Peking restaurant called \"As You Like It\"). The church, mostly rebuilt in 1853, retains 13th-century work in its nave and aisles."

  "description": "This attractive Hertfordshire based village is located near Hitchin , Stevenage , Welwyn Garden City and Harpenden in the county. It's a nice place for a walk with river trails, lovely Chilterns  Hills countryside and some historic timber-framed buildings to see in the village. This walk from Codicote takes you through the River Mimram Valley to the delightful Hoo Park, which lies just to the north west of the settlement. The park is very pretty with a photogenic old bridge over the river, glorious countryside views and bluebell woods to enjoy. On the way you'll also pass the Ford at Kimpton Mill, another fine spot on the river. To continue your walking around Codicote head east to visit Knebworth Country Park . There's 250 acres of wonderful parkland surrounding the historic Knebworth House here.",
