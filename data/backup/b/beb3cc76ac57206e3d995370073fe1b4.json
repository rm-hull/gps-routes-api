  "description": "This picturesque village is located just to the east of Easingwold in the Hambleton District of North Yorkshire. The village is a great base for exploring the surrounding countryside of the Howardian Hills Walks AONB and the Hambleton Hills. This walk from Crayke takes you north to visit some of the highlights of the area. The route follows a section of the Foss Walk long distance trail to visit Oulston Reservoir, Coxwold, Newburgh Priory and Byland Abbey. It's a varied walk with views of the River Foss, woodland trails and two historic sites to see on the way. The 12th century Newburgh Priory includes some lovely grounds with gardens and a lake to admire. At Byland Abbey you can explore the extensive ruins of the 12th century abbey. For an alternative circular walk through the area see the Easingwold Walk .",
