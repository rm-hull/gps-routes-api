  "description": "This popular Welsh seaside town marks the start of the epic Llyn Coastal Path which takes you along the beautiful Llyn Peninsula. This walk uses part of the long distance trail and a section of a dismantled railway line to create a lovely circular walk around the town. The walk starts at the historic Caernarfon Castle in the town centre. The castle dates back to the 11th century and has a fascinating history. The route then crosses the Aber Swing Bridge which crosses the Afon Seiont. You then follow the coast path south to Llanfaglan where you will pass the noteworthy St Baglan's Church. The Grade I listed building dates from the 13th century with a lintel consisting of a 6th-century inscribed stone positioned over the doorway. The route then runs along the lovely Foryd Bay which is also a nature reserve with lots of birdlife to look out for. It is located at the south-western end of the Menai Strait and includes large areas of mudflats and salt marsh. Keep your eyes peeled for waders and wildfowl including brent goose, jack snipe, spotted redshank and greenshank. The walk then leaves the coast to head east through the countryside to Dinas. There is a train station here on the Welsh Highland Railway which you could catch back into Caernarfon if your legs are weary. This route picks up the Lon Eifion shared walking and cycling trail which follows a disused railway path north. You'll cross the Afon Gwyrfai before returning to Caernarfon. The town is on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park where there's lots of great options for walkers. On the other side of the Menai Strait you can visit Anglesey for more fine coastal trails.",
