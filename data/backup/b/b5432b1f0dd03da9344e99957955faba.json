  "description": "This Peak District village is a fine place to start a walk. The village is surrounded by some splendid moorland scenery with many sites of geological interest to explore. It's a picturesque place with a number of fine old cottages built with the pink gritstone from the nearby Stanton Moor quarries. This circular walk from the village visits the Nine Ladies Stone Circle, Stanton Moor and Darley Dale. The walk starts in the village and heads north east to climb to Stanton Moor and the Nine Ladies. These 9 upright stones are thought to depict nine ladies turned to stone as a penalty for dancing on Sunday. The site dates from the Bronze age about 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. The route then heads south east to Stanton Lees, Bee Hill and Warencarr before heading to Darley Bridge on the River Derwent. In this area you could pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way and enjoy a stroll along the river towards Rowsley. The route then heads west along Oldfield Lane, passing Cowley Knowl, Sabine Hay Wood and Birchover Wood before returning to the village. To extend the walk head west to visit the popular Robin Hood's Stride. The splendid rock formation is one of the highlights of the area. There's also the Bronze Age Nine Stones Close Stone Circle just north of the rocks.",

Just up the street there's also The Druid Inn to try. It too has an interesting history having once been the meeting place of the Druids who used the sites around the village for ceremonial worship in ancient times."
