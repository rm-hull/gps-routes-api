  "description": "A short circular walk around the delightful Oxfordshire village of Culham, passing the 15th century Culham Manor and the picturesque Culham Lock on the River Thames. You can start the walk from the free lock car park by the river. Then follow paths across Sutton Bridge to Sutton Pools to the north of the neighbouring village of Sutton Courtenay. You'll pass the picturesque weir and manor house before heading through the village and returning to the car park. For a longer walk in the area try the Abingdon Circular Walk which starts from the nearby town.",
