  "description": "This Surrey based village is located near Guildford in the north-west corner of the Weald. The village is well served by a number of public footpaths heading into the surrounding countryside and expansive forest areas. This circular walk from the village takes you east to visit neighbouring Ewhurst Green. On the way you will pass through Book Hurst Wood and Canfold Wood where you can see pretty bluebells in the springtime. Ewhurst Green is a nice place for a stroll too with oasthouses, a village pond and an interesting old church to see. To continue your walking in the area head north to Winterfold Forest where you will find miles of walking and cycling trails including the epic Greensand Way. On the western side of the village you can pick up the Downs Link which links the North and South Downs National Trails.",
