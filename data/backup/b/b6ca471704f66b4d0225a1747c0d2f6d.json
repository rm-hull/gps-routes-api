At its peak the Upleatham Mine was the second largest in the area after Eston but by the turn of the 20th century the Main Seam was almost exhausted. As the First World War approached an increase in the price of ore was such that thinner Pecten seam became commercially viable. The Pecten seam was 2'10\" thick compared to the Main 10'6\" and was extracted here, at the east end of the royalty, by quarrying. The workings were abandoned entirely in 1923."

  "description": "This walk explores the woodland trails in Errington Woods in New Marske, North Yorkshire. You can start the walk from the car park at the western end of the woods, on the southern edge of New Marske village. From here you can pick up the peaceful trails heading east towards the nearby coast. On the way there are nice views of the Teesside countryside and lots of woodland birds to look out for. Also of interest is the evidence of the old ironstone mine and narrow gauge railway which once stood on the site. You can turn it into a longer circular walk by continuing south to Upleatham. The woods are also popular with mountain bikers with some fine downhill trails to try. See the video below for more details.",
