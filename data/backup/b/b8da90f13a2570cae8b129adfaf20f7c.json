  "description": "This coastal Cumbrian village is a great place for riverside, estuary and beach walking. It is part of the Copeland District of the county and is notable as the only coastal village in the Lake District National Park. Ravenglass is located on no fewer than three river estuaries in the shape of the rivers Esk, Mite and Irt. Also of interest is the wonderful Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway. The heritage steam railway will take you from the village to Dalegarth for Boot station, passing across the estuary and through the hills with some glorious scenery to enjoy on the way. This circular walk from the village visits the Drigg Beach and River Irt Estuary Nature Reserve located just to the west of the settlement. You can follow a section of the waymarked Cumbria Coastal Way to the beach, passing Drigg village on the way. At the reserve you will find the lovely Eskmeals Dunes where there's grassland dunes, saltmarsh and lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. In the summer months look out for pretty wildflowers and birds including ringed plover, skylark and wheatear. You can often see butterflies fluttering around the flowers too. On the estuary there's lots of waders, such as ringed plover, curlew and oystercatcher, alongside ducks like wigeon and goldeneye. The site includes a 2.5 mile circular walk but is only accessible at low tide. Please check tide times before you start the walk. To continue your walking around Ravenglass enjoy a climb to the viewpoint at Muncaster Fell and pay a visit to the striking Muncaster Castle .",
