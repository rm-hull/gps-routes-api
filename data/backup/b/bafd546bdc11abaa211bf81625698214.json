  "description": "This circular walk uses the Ridgeway and the Aldbourne Circular Walk to climb Liddington Hill near Swindon. On the hill you will find Liddington Castle, a late Bronze Age and early Iron Age hill fort.  The route climbs to a height over 900 feet with fantastic views over the countryside of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. You start the walk at the car park just south of the village of Chiseldon. You then follow footpaths up to Folly Farm before turning north to climb Liddington Hill. You can then explore Liddington Castle, one of the earliest hill forts in Britain,  dating back to the seventh century BC. It's a fascinating and often tranquil area with few visitors. After taking in the wonderful views the walk then descends to Sugar Hill and Shipley Bottom before returning to Folly Farm and the car park. An alternative route is to follow the Aldbourne Circular Walk from the village of Aldbourne. It's located a few miles south east of the hill. You could extend your walk by picking up the Chiseldon and Marlborough Railway Path. The disused railway runs to Marlborough through some lovely countryside with views of the River Kennet and a visit to some pretty Wiltshire villages. Also nearby is Barbury Castle Country Park and the splendid Coate Water Country Park which has nice cycling and walking trails around a large lake.",
