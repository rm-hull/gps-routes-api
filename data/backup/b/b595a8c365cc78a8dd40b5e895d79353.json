  "description": "This circular walk or cycle explores the RSPB Rainham Marshes Nature Reserve in London. It's an easy route using part of National Cycle Route 13 and other signed trails. The route runs mostly along a riverside path by the River Thames from Purfleet to Rainham and a trail through the centre of the reserve. The reserve has a variety of regular winged visitors, including peregrines, lapwings and wild ducks. There are also water voles and rare dragonflies to be seen across the boardwalks. Also take time to explore the visitor centre which has a wealth of information about the area. This route is easily accesible with train stations at either end at Purfleet and Rainham. You can also hire bikes at the reserve.",
