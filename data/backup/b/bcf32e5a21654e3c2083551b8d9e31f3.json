The mill closed around 1898 and was abandoned"

  "description": "This circular walk explores the Cheesden Valley in the Rochdale area of Greater Manchester. In the scenic valley you will find a series of footpaths running along the pretty Cheesden Brook. There's also lakes, hill climbs, ruins of the historic old mills and some lovely countryside views to enjoy. The walk starts from the 18th century Owd Bett's Pub next to Ashworth Moor Reservoir on the Edenfield Road, just to the north west of Rochdale. From here you can pick up trails running north west along the reservoir towards Lumb Bridge and the photogenic ruins of the Lumb Mill. Here you turn south to pick up the trails along the brook to Deeply Vale and Deeply Hill. You continue past Cleggs Wood to Simpson's Clough where you pick up the Rochdale Way for the return leg of the journey. This waymarked footpath will take you north along the Naden Brook to return you to the reservoir and the car park. For a shorter circular walk exploring the southern end of the valley see the Ashworth Valley Walk .",
