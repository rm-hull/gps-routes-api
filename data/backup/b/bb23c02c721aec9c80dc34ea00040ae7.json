In the distance, rising above Banstead Wood, is the water tower of the former Queen Elizabeth Hospital, now converted to a residential estate."

  "description": "These lovely woods in Surrey have miles of well marked walking paths and a nature trail to follow. There's over 230 acres to explore with lots of pretty bluebells in the spring months. The area also includes the Park Downs area of common land which is designated as a site of special scientific interest. You can start your walk from the Holly Lane car park at the north eastern corner of the woods. Chipstead and Kingswood train stations are also very nearby. The car park gives direct access to the nature trail where you can see lots of interesting flora and fauna. Look out for wild primroses, purple emperor butterflies and willow warblers as you make your way along the ancient woodland trail. You can extend your walking in the area by picking up the Banstead Countryside Walk. This 5 mile self guided trail explores Chiphouse Wood, Ruffett Wood and the attractive countryside surrounding the town. If you enjoy this walk then you could head a couple of miles north and visit Banstead Downs. The downs are located just to the north of the town and consist of open grass chalkland, wildflowers and nice views towards London from the high points. A couple of miles to the west is Epsom Common where you can explore the famous racecourse and enjoy attractive chalk downland, grassland and woodland.",

You can see Aslan the Lion, spot Lucy Pevensey waiting by the lamppost and even walk through the wardrobe entrance to Narnia, complete with hanging coats. Just to the south west there's Tadworth and Banstead Heath where there's miles of good walking and cycling trails to try. The heath also includes a fine 16th century pub which is worthy of investigation. For more walking ideas in the area see the Surrey Walks page."
