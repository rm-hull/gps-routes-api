  "description": "The Lincolnshire town of Stamford has a number of good options for walkers visiting the area. Several waymarked long distance trails run through the town and out into the surrounding countryside. There's riverside trails along the River Welland and lovely parkland to explore in the nearby Burghley House too. It's also nice to stroll around the attractive town centre which has 17th and 18th-century stone buildings, older timber-framed buildings and five medieval parish churches. The whole of the old town and St Martin's has been made an outstanding area of architectural or historic interest that is of national importance. In 2013, Stamford was rated the best place to live by The Sunday Times. This short walk follows sections of the Hereward Way and Jurassic Way from the town centre to the nearby village of Easton on the Hill. It starts on riverside paths before climbing through the countryside to the village. To continue your walking in the area you can follow the Hereward Way south west from the town. This will take you across the parkland of Burghley House . The grounds were laid out by Capability Brown and include a 26 acre lake, a deer park and a sculpture park. The trail will eventually lead you into Cambridgeshire and the city of Peterborough . You can also walk to Peterborough along the Torpel Way . This route runs for about 11 miles through through countryside and agricultural land. It includes a riverside stretch along the Welland at the start. For some nice woodland trails, head south west and visit Rockingham Forest where you can explore Fineshade Woods and Wakerley Woods . Rutland Water is located just to the west of the town. There's miles of great waterside cycling and walking trails to be found here. The epic Macmillan Way also passes through the town. Follow it north east and it will take you to Greatford with views of the West Glen River.",
