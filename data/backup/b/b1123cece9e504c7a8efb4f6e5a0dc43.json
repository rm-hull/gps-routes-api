  "description": "The popular park is located on the site of the former Watergate colliery in Gateshead. It includes woodland trails, a pretty lake, a waterfall and wildflower meadows. In the park there are two waymarked walking trails to try. One circular trail takes you around the lake while the second nature trail visits a series of sculptures. There are also cycling trails on the bridleways and permissive paths on the site. You can start the walk from the main car park at the eastern end of the site, just off the B6317 Whickham Highway at Lobley Hill. From here you can pick up the footpaths heading south west towards the lake and the Washingwell Woods.",
