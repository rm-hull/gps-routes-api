  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Llyn Eigiau in the Carneddau Mountains of the Snowdonia National Park. The walk starts from the Llyn Eigiau car park just to the north east of the lake. You can then follow a track heading south west through Cwm Eigiau with stunning views of the surrounding mountains. Follow the trail for about a mile and you will come to the Dam where you can enjoy some splendid views over the water. It's a dramatic area with old slate quarries and the possibility of spotting Carneddau ponies. The lake is also the site of the Dolgarrog Dam Disaster on November 2nd, 1925, when the poorly built dam was breached and inundated the village below with water, killing 16 people. You can extend your walking in the area by heading east to the village and trying the Dolgarrog Pipeline Walk. Just to the south there's more waterside walking along Llyn Cowlyd .",

      "content": "Just to the north is the delightful village of Rowen. The village is considered one of the prettiest villages in Wales and a real hidden gem. The climb to Tal Y Fan, in the Carneddau mountains, is often started from here. To the east is the climb to Cadair Ifan Goch, a National Trust owned area. From the summit of the hills there are excellent views over the River Conwy Valley to the Carneddau mountains. For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
