  "description": "This walk visits the historic Carberry Tower Estate near Musselburgh in East Lothian. The 15th century house is surrounded by some beautiful parkland and gardens with pleasant woodland trails to try as well. The house also sits next to Carberry Hill, the site of a 16th century battle. Here Mary, Queen of Scots, faced an army assembled by a confederation of her lords. She quickly surrendered herself to the lords, and was then imprisoned. On the hill you can see Queen Mary's Mount, a Commemorative Stone at Carberry marking the site of the conflict. Scenic highlights include the fine views from the high points and a Giant Redwood Avenue on the estate. The estate lies just south of Musselburgh where you can enjoy a walk along the River Esk. The woodland and river trails in Dalkeith Country Park lie just to the west if you wish to extend your walking in the area.",
