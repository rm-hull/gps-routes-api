  "description": "Follow the Berwickshire Coastal Path from Berwick on Tweed in Northumberland, to Cockburnspath, in the Scottish Borders. There's some spectacular coastal scenery to enjoy as you pass along the Northumberland and Scottish cliff tops. There are also a series of pretty coastal villages with delightful harbours including Burnmouth, Eyemouth, St Abbs and Cove. The Berwick Walls Walk is a worthy walk to do at the start of the route. The short trail exposes you to the fascinating history of the town as you traverse the 16th century walls.",
