  "description": "Explore the heathland, woodland, grassland and ponds on this large area of common land in Guildford . The common is criss crossed with a number of good footpaths. Features include a pretty stream where you can look out for water voles and other wildlife. The extensive area of open heathland is surrounded by attractive Scots pine, oak and birch woodland. Look out for other interesting flora such as bell heather, ling and bracken. This circular walk starts at the car park off Salt Box Road at the southern end of the common. You have the option of continuing your walk in the adjacent Stringer's Common. The common is located across the road just to the south of Whitmoor Common. There's more nice tracks through woodland and around Britten's Pond. The common is located just a couple of miles north of Guildford town centre. You can further extend your walk by picking up the Wey South Path and enjoying a riverside stroll through Guildford. This will take you to the lovely Riverside Park Nature Reserve and Parsonage Water Meadows.",
