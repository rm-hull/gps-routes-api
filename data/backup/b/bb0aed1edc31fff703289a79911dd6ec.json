  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk or cycle along the Barnsley Canal on this easy route near Royston. This section of the canal follows National Cycle Network Route 67 from Shaw Bridge, near Royston, to Walton. The route runs for just over 5 miles passing Rabbit Ings Country Park, Wintersett Reservoir and the woodland of Haw Park Wood. It's a peaceful area with a nice surfaced path ideal for a safe cycle or easy walk. Rabbit Ings is located next to the canal at Royston and consists of 160 acres of wetland, woodland, grassland and ponds. It also has a mountain bike trail. You can also take a detour near Walton and visit Anglers Country Park. A cycle route runs around Cold Hiendley Reservoir and Wintersett Reservoir to the park. To continue your canal-side exercise head north and you can pick up the Wakefield Canal to Castelford.",
