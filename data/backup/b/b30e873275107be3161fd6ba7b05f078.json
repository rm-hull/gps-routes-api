    "description": "This area of common land near Newton Abbot has some nice footpaths to try. The common is located just a half mile north of the Devon village if Ideford. You could start the walk from there if you like but this route starts from the car park at the northern edge of the common. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south through the woodland, heathland and grassland on the site. Look out for birdlife including nightjars and Dartford warbler as you go. The common is in an elevated position so there are nice views down to the village and across the broad valley of the Teign Estuary. It's a very attractive and peaceful area so you could easily spend a couple of hours strolling along the various paths. There's also the option of heading north and exploring the adjacent Haldon Forest if you have time. To the west of the common you can pick up the River Teign Walk near Chudleigh . The long river walk explores the Teign Valley. You could follow it south, for example, to visit the Chudleigh Knighton Heath Nature Reserve.",
