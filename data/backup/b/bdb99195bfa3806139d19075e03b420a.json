They never completed their journey, the pub in Llanwonno being the only place that would serve Gwyn's father on a Sunday. When Gwyn Thomas died in 1981 his ashes were scattered in the churchyard."

  "description": "This walk visits the waterfall near the hamlet of Llanwonno in St Gwynno Forest, in the heart of the South Wales Valleys. The circular walk takes you to the tranquil Clydach Reservoir before heading to the Pistyll Goleu waterfall. It's a very peaceful area with the pleasant woodland trails and a secluded waterfall rarely visited. You can start off from the forestry commission picnic area and car park just south of the falls. Then pick up the trails heading north to the reservoir before turning south to the waterfall. There's a riverside footpath here which you can follow east before returning along a quiet country lane. To continue your exercise in the area head east to pick up the Taff Trail. The popular cycling and walking trail will take you along the River Taff around nearby Pontypridd, Merthyr Tydfil and Abercynon.",
