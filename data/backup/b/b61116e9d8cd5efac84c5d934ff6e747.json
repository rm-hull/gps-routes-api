  "description": "Enjoy a short stroll around the pretty Haughton Country Park in Alford, Aberdeenshire. Highlights in the park include a sequence of peaceful woodland trails and a lovely riverside walking path along the River Don which runs along the north eastern edge of the park. This area also contains a wildflower meadow and the grand Haughton House mansion. There are also wide grassy lawns perfect for a picnic. The park is located about twenty five miles west of the City of Aberdeen. Just to the south of the park is the Alford Valley Narrow Gauge Railway where you can catch a steam train on the first Sunday of each month. To continue your walking in the Aberdeen area, head east and visit Kirkhill Forest. There's miles of good waymarked trails with hill climbs and great viewpoints to be found here. You could also head to the nearby Bennachie Forest where there's more fine trails with some challenging climbs in the Bennachie Hills to enjoy too.",
