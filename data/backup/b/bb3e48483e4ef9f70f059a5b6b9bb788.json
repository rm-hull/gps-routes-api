  "description": "Visit these spectacular 46 metre high falls in the Highlands of Scotland on this short circular walk near Tomich. Part of the Glen Affric National Nature Reserve these wonderful falls are surrounded by attractive Douglas fir forest. The forestry commission of Scotland have created two waymarked trails called the Plodda Falls Trail and Tweedmouth Trail. You can pick up the trails from the car park and follow them through woodland and along the Abhainn Deabhag river to the falls. It's a spendid area with well laid out trails, majestic towering trees, the rushing waters of the falls and a great viewing platform jutting out over the waterfall below. To explore the area further try the Glen Affric walk which visits the River Affric before circuiting the beautiful Loch Affric. It's a stunning area with a series of lochs, mountains, towering pines and wildlife such as golden eagles, mountain hares and red deer to look out for. Also in the glen you can pick up the Dog Falls Trail and enjoy a waterside walk along the River Affric with a series of waterfalls followed by a climb to a splendid viewpoint.",

      "content": "The Affric Kintail Way passes along the southern side of Glen Affric Loch. This long distance trail runs from Loch Ness to Morvich via Glen Urquhart and Glen Affric. If you were to follow the trail east it would take you along Loch Beinn a`Mheadhoin to the village of Cannich. Heading west takes you through the Glenaffric Forest to the Kintail Forest and the River Croe. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
