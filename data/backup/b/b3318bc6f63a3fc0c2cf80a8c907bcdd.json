  "description": "Enjoy over 200 acres of parkland in East London on this short cycle or walk. The park boasts two cafes, a boating lake and several tree lined walkways. National Cycle Network route 1 also runs through the park so you can bring your bike. Good access points are Cambridge Heath and Hackney Wick rail stations or Mile End tube station. To extend your exercise you can head east and visit the Olympic Park where there's over 500 acres of parkland, waterways, playgrounds and cafes. The Capital Ring, Lea Valley Walk and Jubilee Greenway long distance trails also run through the area so you could pick up any of these to extend your walk.",
