This is taken on the wooden jetty on the north side of the ponds. These ponds are man-made and actually large enough to be called Creekmoor Lakes. They are situated right in the centre of the Creekmoor housing estate and are popular with walkers, dog walkers, cyclists and ducks!"

  "description": "Corfe Mullen sits on the northern outskirts of the Dorset town of Poole. It's very close to both Upton Heath and Upton Country Park where there are some fine walking trails and lots of wildlife to see. The Castleman Trailway also runs through the area. This could be followed north to visit the historic Minster in Wimborne. Here you can link up with the Stour Valley Way and enjoy some pleasant riverside walks around Pamphill, Sturminster Marshall and the National Trust's Kingston Lacy. This walk explores the Upton Heath Nature Reserve before following the Castleman Trailway up to the nearby Delph Woods and Dunyeats Nature Reserve. You can extend the walk by exploring Canford Heath which lies just to the east of Delph Woods. The woods are a pleasant local place for a stroll with peaceful shady paths, a pretty stream and lots of wildlife to look out for.",
