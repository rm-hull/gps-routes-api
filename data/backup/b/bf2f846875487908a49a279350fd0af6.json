  "description": "Climb to this hill in Knightwick on this walk in the Malvern Hills. There's a nice waterside stretch along the River Teme, woodland trails and great views from the high points. The circular walk starts in the village of Knightwick and heads to Horsham Farm along the River Teme. You then climb through Hay Wood to Ankerdine Hill which reaches a height of well over 400ft. On the hill there's some nice woodland trails and great views over the Worcestershire countryside. This walk uses part of the Worcestershire Way to climb the hill. You could pick up the trail to extend your walk. Heading north will take you to Woodbury Hill while heading south will take you to Ravenshill Wood. The hill is also just south of the village of Martley where you can visit the interesting Norman Church and pick up the Martley Circular Walk. The waymarked trail visits the attractive orchards and woodland surrounding the village.",
