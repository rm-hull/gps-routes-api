  "description": "Climb this 486m (1594 feet) mountain in the Brecon Beacons on this challenging walk. Skirrid Fawr (or Ysgyryd Fawr) forms part of the Black Mountains range. The walk starts in Abergavenny , next to the tourist information centre and follows the Marches Way long distance trail to the summit. Here you will find the ruins of an\u00a0iron\u2013age\u00a0hill fort\u00a0and St Michael's medieval\u00a0Roman Catholic church. There are splendid views across the Brecon Beacons, Black Mountains, Abergavenny and the surrounding countryside. The walk descends through woodland areas before rejoining the Marches Way and returning to Abergavenny. If you'd like to climb another black mountain then the iconic Sugarloaf is also near Abergavenny. The Brecon Beacons Way also runs through the area so you could pick this up to continue your walk.",
