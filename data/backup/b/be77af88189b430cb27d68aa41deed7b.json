  "description": "Climb this 486m (1594 feet) mountain in the Brecon Beacons on this challenging walk. Skirrid Fawr (or Ysgyryd Fawr) forms part of the Black Mountains range. The walk starts in Abergavenny, next to the tourist information centre and follows the Marches Way long distance trail to the summit. Here you will find the ruins of an iron\u2013age hill fort and St Michael's medieval Roman Catholic church. There are splendid views across the Brecon Beacons, Black Mountains, Abergavenny and the surrounding countryside. The walk descends through woodland areas before rejoining the Marches Way and returning to Abergavenny. If you'd like to climb another black mountain then the iconic Sugarloaf is also near Abergavenny. The Brecon Beacons Way also runs through the area so you could pick this up to continue your walk.",

It's an historic pub of some note, dating from the 12th century and reputed to be one of the oldest pubs in Wales. The interior of the pub is full of olde-world charm and outside there's a nice garden area if the weather is fine. They also provide good quality accommodation if you need to stay over. Be warned though, the ancient pub is said to be haunted! You can find them at a postcode of NP7 8DH for your sat navs."

      "content": "On the other side of Abergavenny you'll find another popular local climb in the shape of the Blorenge. It's a slightly higher hill, providing more wonderful views over the area from the summit. On the western slopes of the mountain there's also the delightful Keepers Pond. The small lake is a popular place for easy walks, wild swimming and picnics. The hill is located close to the worthy town of Blaenavon. The historic town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which includes a fascinating industrial museum and a wonderful heritage steam railway. You could catch the railway south and visit Pontypool where there's the extensive Pontypool Park to visit. You can also pick up the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal here and follow it to the popular Goytre Wharf. For more walking ideas in the area see the Black Mountains Walks and the Brecon Beacons Walks pages."
