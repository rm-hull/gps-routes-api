  "description": "This walk follows the Croagh Patrick Pilgrimage Trail to the summit of Croagh Patrick Mountain in County Mayo. The historic mountain is climbed by thousands of pilgrims every year on Reek Sunday, the last Sunday in July, a custom which goes back to at least the Middle Ages. It's 3.5km walk to the top so about 7km there and back. It should take between 3 to 4 hours to complete the route. The path is qute a challenging one making trekking poles advisable due to the loose rocks and steep incline. You can start the walk from the small village of Murrisk which lies just to the north east of the mountain. From here you can pick up the trail and follow it south towards Lugnademon. Here you bend round to the west to reach the 764 m (2,507 ft)  high summit of Croagh Patrick. From the top there are glorious views over Westport Bay, Clew Bay and the Mayo mountains.",
