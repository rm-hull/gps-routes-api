  "description": "This walk visits Manley Mere near the Cheshire villages of Manley and Dunham on the Hill. The lake is located just to the west of the village of Manley and includes some nice walking paths, an Aqua Park, watersports and an adventure trail. You can enjoy a stroll around the water and watch the boats and other watersports on the lake. To extend the walk you can pick up the dismantled railway line just to the east of the lake. This shared cycling and walking trail can be followed north towards Helsby where you can enjoy a climb to the viewpoint on Helsby Hill. You could also pick up the Longster Trail to the east.",
