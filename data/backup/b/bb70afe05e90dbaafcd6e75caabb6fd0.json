  "description": "This walk visits the Threshfield Quarry near Grassington in North Yorkshire. You can start the walk at Skirethorns Lane which lies just to the west of both Threshfield and Grassington. From here you can pick up public footpaths heading north around the old limestone quarry. The atmospheric site is now a pleasant place for a peaceful walk in striking surroundings. There are great views from the high points and small lakes of a milky turquoise colour. There are also the old kilns and the disused rail track making it a photogenic and unusual landscape to explore on foot. You can extend the walk by heading east into Grassington to visit the lovely Linton Falls. Head south east and you can visit the village of Threshfield itself. There's a footpath running along the Spiredale Beck you could pick up.",
