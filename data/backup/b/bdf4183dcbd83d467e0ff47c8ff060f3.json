The four sails were double shuttered and powered two pairs of French burr stones; there was a stage around the second floor. The mill is located by the 17th century deep water quay; converted into a holiday home in the 1920s it is now a B&B establishment."

  "description": "This walk takes you from Blakeney to the neighbouring village of Cley Next the Sea. The route follows a section of the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path for a distance of just under 3 miles. It's a flat, waymarked trail so suitable for most abilities. On the way you'll enjoy lovely coastal views towards Blakeney Point Nature Reserve and a riverside stroll along the River Glavan. The area is great for coastal birds so keep your eyes peeled for birds such as avocet and marsh harrier as you make your way along the path. The walk starts from the pretty Blakeney Quay and follows the footpath north along Fresh Marshes to Blakeney Eye and the site of the old Blakeney Chapel. The trail then turns south to follow a section along the River Glavan into Cley. You'll pass the picturesque Cley windmill before coming into the village.",
