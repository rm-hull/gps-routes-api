  "description": "This walk takes you along the Fossdyke Canal from Lincoln to Odder. The route runs for a distance of about 4 miles along a flat waterside path, using a section of National Cycle Network Route 64. Start the walk at the Brayford Pool Marina in Lincoln city centre. The area is located just a short stroll from the train station. From here you can pick up the shared cycling and walking trail and follow it north west past the University and out into the countryside toward Odder. About half way along you have the option of branching off to the west on the Harby to Lincoln Cycle Route. This will take you along a dismantled railway line toward Skellingthorpe where you could visit the peaceful woodland trails in Skellingthorpe Woods .",
