  "description": "Follow the Grafton Way from Wolverton, Milton Keynes to Greens Norton in Northamptonshire. The walk starts following the Grand Union Canal to Cosgrove before heading into the countryside and passing the villages of Yardley Gobion, Paulerspury and Towcester. Around Yardley Gobion you could take a detour from the route and visit the worthy village of Stoke Bruerne. The village is centred around the canal and includes the interesting Canal Museum and a series of fine canalside pubs. The museum houses stories, films, collections and displays all about our waterways and is well worth a visit.",
