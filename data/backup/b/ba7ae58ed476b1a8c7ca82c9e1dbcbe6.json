  "description": "This walk climbs to unusual structure of White Nancy overlooking the town of Bollington in Cheshire. The folly is in the shape of a small domed sugar loaf and thought to have been built in 1817 by Colonel Gaskell as a monument to the Battle of Waterloo. This circular walk makes use of the Gritstone Trail to take you from Bollington to the 280.5 metres (920\u00a0ft) high White Nancy before crossing the Saddle of Kerrridge to Kerridge Hill. From the elevated position above the town you can enjoy splendid views across the\u00a0Cheshire Plain, the mountains of\u00a0North Wales\u00a0to the west, the hills of\u00a0Shropshire\u00a0to the south and the\u00a0Pennines\u00a0to the north and east. It's easy to extend your walk by continuing along the Gritstone Trail to the nearby Tegg's Nose Country Park .",
