  "description": "This pretty Mid Sussex based village is close to some fine High Weald countryside walking. This route from the village uses sections of the Sussex Ouse Valley Way and the High Weald Landscape Trail to create a long circular walk through the surrounding countryside. On the way you'll visit the beautiful Nymans Gardens and the neighbouring villages of Handcross and Bolney. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the High Weald Landscape Trail and follow the waymarked footpath north towards Whitemans Green and Brook Street. At Sidnye Farm you pick up the Sussex Ouse Valley Way and follow it west to Staplefield and Handcross where you can pay a visit to one of the highlights of the area at Nymans Gardens. Here you'll find woodland walks with pools, streams, a rock garden and a Arboretum. Near here you can also visit the beautiful High Beeches Gardens if you wish. At Handcross you can pick up the Landscape Trail again and follow it south Slaugham, passing the ruins of Slaugham Place and a pretty mill pond before continuing to Warninglid. You continue south through Wykehurst Park to Bolney where there's a 12th century church and the impressive Bolney Wine Estate to see. Turn east here to start a woodland section through Bolney Wood to Pickwell and Ragget's Wood before the final section through Cuckfield Park returns you to the village.",
