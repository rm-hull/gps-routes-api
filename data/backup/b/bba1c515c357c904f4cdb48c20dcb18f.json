  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Ilkley to Addingham along the River Wharfe. It first uses a section of the Dales Way long distance trail to take you along the river to Addingham. Here you can cross the Wharfe on a Suspension Foot Bridge and return through the countryside via Nesfield, Low Austby and Owler Park. The route is just over 5 miles with some moderate climbs on the return leg. The walk starts from the Roman Fort in the Victorian spa town of Ilkley. A wall, once part of the fort, can still be seen near the town's old Manor House Art Gallery & Museum. From here you can pick up the Dales Way and follow it north west along the river to Addingham. You could head into the town and stop for refreshments at one of the pubs or cafes, at what is roughly the half way point of the route. This walk crosses the river and climbs past the Castleberge Fort. Thought to be an iron age fort (but never properly investigated), it sits atop a sizeable natural hill at a bend in the River Wharfe. From here you continue to Nesfield and Low Austby where you head through the woodland of Owler Park before descending back to the river and the town. To extend your walking in the area you can visit the splendid Bolton Abbey or head to Ilkley Moor .",
