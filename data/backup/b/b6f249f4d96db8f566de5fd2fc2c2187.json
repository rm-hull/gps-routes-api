Although a mill has stood at this location on the River Test since at least 1086, it underwent major rebuilding and expansion in the mid-19th century when the company secured a contract with the Government of India to produce Indian Rupee paper as well as Bank of England paper. The mill was restored for Bombay Sapphire to a design by Thomas Heatherwick during 2012-2014."

    "description": "This delightful Hampshire village sits in an idyllic location on the River Test. It's a lovely place for a stroll with easy riverside walks, pretty gardens and a noteworthy old mill to explore. There's also miles of good trails through the surrounding countryside of the North Wessex Downs AONB. This walk from the town takes you east along the River Test to neighbouring Freefolk and Laverstoke. On the way you'll pass historic mills, weirs and pockets of woodland on the southern side of the river. It's about a 5 mile walk there and back. Near the start of the walk you'll pass one of the highlights of the area at the Winchester Silk Mill . Here you can learn all about the town's milling history with a series of exhibits, the originial water wheel and other old machinery to see. There's also some pleasant riverside gardens and a nature trail at the site. At the eastern end of the route there's some fine old churches to see in Freefolk and Laverstoke. There's also the Bombay Sapphire Distillery at Laverstoke Mill. You can tour the distillery to find out exactly what goes into the making of the famous gin. On the return leg you can cross to the northern side of the river and explore the area around picturesque Bere Mill and bridge.",
