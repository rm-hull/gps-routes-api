  "description": "Enjoy a nice easy stroll around this pretty lake in Tonbridge. The lake is located just to the west of the town centre and includes a nice flat footpath running around the perimeter for just under a mile. There's also an information board which displays all the different birds you can can see on the water. You can follow the waymarked Eden Valley Walk from the centre of Tonbridge to the lake if you prefer. It's less than a mile and passes the ruins of the castle on the way. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the Cafe in the Park which is located close to the lake. The lake is part of the wider Haysden Country Park which includes the Eden Valley Walk. You can pick up the long distance trail to continue your and follow it west through the park to the River Medway.",
