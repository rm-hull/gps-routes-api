  "description": "This is a short climb to Lord Hereford's Knob or Twmpa in the Black Mountains. The scenery is stunning with magnificent views over the Brecon Beacons National Park on one side and the Herefordshire countryside on the other. You can park at the Gospel Pass car park about 1 mile to the east of the hill. From here you can pick up the footpath to the 690\u00a0m (2,260\u00a0ft) summit. Like the nearby Hay Bluff the entire hill is designated as open country so walkers have the\u00a0freedom to roam\u00a0at will. You could start the walk from Hay on Wye if you prefer. Just follow the Offa's Dyke Path south to the Hay-on-Bluff car park and stone circle. Then follow country lanes or other footpaths to Twmpa.",
