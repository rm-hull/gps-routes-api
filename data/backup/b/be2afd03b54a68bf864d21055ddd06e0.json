  "description": "This circular walk from the Lancashire village of Whalley visits Whalley Nab and the Spring Wood Nature Reserve. There's some lovely woodland trails, riverside paths along the River Calder and fine views from the high points. The walk starts in the village centre and then heads south to cross the River Calder and visit Nab Wood and Whalley Banks. Continue south east and you will soon meet with the River Calder where you can follow a riverside path to Cock Bridge. Cross the bridge and then follow footpaths north east to Read Park and Read Hall. You continue north to cross the Sabden Brook on Read Old Bridge before passing Portfield and Clerk Hill. Here you turn west to enter the Spring Wood Nature Reserve where there's lots of wildlife, a nature trail and carpets of bluebells in the spring time. After passing west through the wood you soon return to Whalley village.",
