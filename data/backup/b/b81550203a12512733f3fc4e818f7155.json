The Eastern side of the wall from the memorial cross to the trig on Buckden Pike is extremely treacherous and boggy, but thanks to a couple of new stiles, walkers are now able to climb over the wall and make the last six tenths of a mile of their journey in relative ease on the Western side of the wall. This is where this boundary stone can be found. To the south of the summit is a memorial cross, dedicated to the memory of five Polish airmen of the Polish Air Force 18th Polish Operational Training Unit based at RAF Bramcote who crashed their Wellington Bomber on 30 January 1942."

  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the 702 metres (2,303 ft) summit of Buckden Pike in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Buckden Pike is considered to be one of the finest climbs in Yorkshire with its splendid views over the beautiful Wharfedale and the Nidderdale AONB. There's also waterside sections along the area's rivers and gills with photogenic waterfalls to see on the way. The walk starts in the parking area in the village of Buckden and follows a bridleway to the summit.  From here there are wonderful views of Great Whernside , Yockenthwaite Moor and across the Yorkshire Dales. You then descend to Starbotton passing the war memorial to the Polish airmen who died when their Wellington Bomber crashed on Buckden Pike during a snowstorm in 1942. The descent follows the Walden Road with views of pretty becks and waterfalls on the way. At Starbotton you cross the River Wharfe and pick up the Dales Way for a lovely riverside section taking you back to Buckden. Look out for Kingfisher, Heron, and Dipper on this section of the walk. To extend your walking in the area you could head south to the village of Kettlewell and climb to Great Whernside for more great views over Wharfedale.",
