  "description": "Enjoy a series of lovely cycling and walking trails in this good sized country park near Ibstock. There are a number of well surfaced paths taking you past meadows, woodland and three lakes. It's great for families looking for a safe, easy cycle ride or walkers looking for a pleasant afternoon stroll. It's also good for birdwatching with various wildfowl around the lakes. Look out for Heron, swans, coots and mallard. The attractive woodland consists of Corsican pine, larch and poplar and also attracts many different species of bird. The park has good facilities with car parking, toilets and picnic areas. Sence Valley Forest Park is located near Coalville. If you are coming by bike you could follow National Route 52 from the town to the park. If you would like to continue your exercise then you could head to the nearby Thornton Reservoir where there are more waterside walking and cycling paths. Just to the north west there's Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Wood. This wood was planted in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of the Queen. There's more pleasant woodland trails, paths along the Bowers Brook and a pretty lake to see here. You can reach the woods by following a bridle path from the northern end of the park in a north westerly direction for about half a mile.",
