  "description": "This walk visits the Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch in County Down. The estate includes a fine woodland trail with historic birch, beech, douglas-fir and sycamore trees. At the eastern end of the site there's also the Ballynahinch River where you can look out for dippers and kingfishers. There's a pleasant riverside footpath on the other side of the river that you can pick up in the town. On the walk look out for a variety of birds including great spotted woodpecker, tree-creepers, buzzards, hawks and pheasants. You may also see pine marten, foxes, rabbits, and squirrels. There's also the Garden Walk which includes a wonderful display of deciduous azaleas and colourful rhododendron in the spring months. The grounds surround a fine 18th century Georgian mansion. To continue your walking in the area head a couple of miles south west to visit Drumkeeragh Forest where there's more peaceful woodland trails and the opportunity to climb to the splendid viewpoint at Slieve Croob .",
