    "description": "This pretty reservoir near Yeovil has a short walking trail through a hay meadow on the western bank of the water. There's lots of pretty wildflowers and great views across the lovely blue waters of the lake from the viewpoint. The meadow includes flora such as the purple Meadow Saffron and yellow Bird's foot trefoil. These attract a wide variety of butterflies such as Small Skipper and Marble White. On the lake you can look out for a number of water loving birds such as Pochard, Coot and Tufted Duck. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then the Monarch's Way runs through East Coker just to the north of the reservoir. This popular waymarked trail leads you north to Yeovil Country Park where you will find 127 acres of rivers, lakes, waterfalls, open grassland and woodland.",
