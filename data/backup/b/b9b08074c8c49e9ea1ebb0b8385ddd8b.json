  "description": "This walk follows the Jurassic limestone ridge from Banbury to Stamford passing through Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Lincolnshire. The walk includes a stretch along the Oxford Canal from Banbury and another waterside stretch along the Grand Union Canal near Braunston. There's nice woodland trails through Fineshade Woods in the ancient Rockingham Forest area and you will also enjoy fine views of the River Welland as you approach Stamford. The route passes through a series of picturesque towns and villages including Wardington, Catesby, Welford, Braunston, Ashby St Ledgers (with its impressive Manor House), West Haddon and Middleton. You'll also pass close to Naseby Battlefield, site of the famous Battle of Naseby in the English Civil War in 1645. There's a section along Welford and Sulby Reservoir here too.",
