  "description": "This pleasant circular walk takes you around the Habberley Valley nature reserve in Kidderminster. There's nice trails here taking you to woodland, grassland and heathland with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Keep your eyes peeled for woodpeckers, buzzards, owls and sparrowhawks as you make your way along the paths. The trails are well signed and take place on well maintained footpaths. It's mostly fairly flat but there are some moderate climbs on the way. You can start the walk at Low Habberley where there is a car park and visitor centre on the Habberley Rd at postcode DY11 5RH for your sat navs. It's located just to the north west of Kidderminster town centre. From here pick up the trails heading north west towards Trimpley. You then head east to Easthams Farm before turning south to return to Low Habberley and the car park.",
