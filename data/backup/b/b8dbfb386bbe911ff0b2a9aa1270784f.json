  "description": "This Northamptonshire based village lies close to the border with Oxfordshire and the town of Banbury . The village is home to Aynhoe Park , a 17th century country estate with some wonderful architecture. The park is privately owned but you can follow public footpaths around the edge of the estate. The circular walk visits the neighbouring village of Souldern with some fine views over the surrounding countryside to enjoy. The walk also passes the noteworthy church of St Michael which includes a 14th-century\u00a0Decorated Gothic\u00a0tower. You can extend the walk by heading west to pick up the towpath on the Oxford Canal Walk .",
