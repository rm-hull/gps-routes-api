  "description": "Follow the Great Glen, running from Fort William in the west to Inverness in the east. The route is suitable for walkers and cyclists with a mountain bike or robust hybrid. The stunning trail follows the Caledonian Canal and the shores of Loch Lochy , Loch Oich and Loch Ness with the mountains of the Ben Nevis range making a splendid backdrop. The route also passes Fort Augustus and includes several woodland sections, most notably through Creag nan Eun Forest. The final section along the River Ness to the finish point at Inverness Castle is also noteworthy. The route is coincident with the Caledonia Way . This epic cycle route runs for 234 miles from Campbeltown to Inverness. It's a great way of continuing your cycling or walking in the area. The Great Glen Way is waymarked with a black hexagon thistle.",
