  "description": "Follow the Great Glen, running from Fort William in the west to Inverness in the east. The route is suitable for walkers and cyclists with a mountain bike or robust hybrid. The stunning trail follows the Caledonian Canal and the shores of Loch Lochy, Loch Oich and Loch Ness with the mountains of the Ben Nevis range making a splendid backdrop. The route also passes Fort Augustus and includes several woodland sections, most notably through Creag nan Eun Forest. The final section along the River Ness to the finish point at Inverness Castle is also noteworthy. The route is coincident with the Caledonia Way. This epic cycle route runs for 234 miles from Campbeltown to Inverness. It's a great way of continuing your cycling or walking in the area. The Great Glen Way is waymarked with a black hexagon thistle.",

      "content": "Near Inverness you could head a short distance north east to visit one of the historic highlights of the area at Culloden Battlefield. There's a circular walking trail here which explores the site of the famous battle of 1746. The site includes an informative visitor centre where you can learn all about this fascinating conflict. On the south eastern side of the battlefield there's also the Clava Cairns and the Culloden Viaduct. The ancient Bronze Age site includes prehistoric burial monuments and the remains of a medieval chapel. It's also a short walk from the eye catching Culloden Viaduct which carries the Highland Main Line over the River Nairn. The Affric Kintail Way can be picked up at Drumnadrochit on the western side of Loch Ness. This long distance trail runs from the loch to Morvich via Glen Urquhart and Glen Affric. If you were to follow the trail west from Loch Ness it would take you to Loch Meiklie and the village of Cannich. Also near Drumnadrochit you can visit the historic Urquhart Castle. The photogenic 13th century castle ruins are positioned in a dramatic spot overlooking the western side of Loch Ness. At Loch Ness you can enjoy a view of Invermoriston Falls from the 19th century Thomas Telford bridge. The old bridge is located just south west of the village and provides fine views over the rushing falls. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
