  "description": "This beautiful loch is located a few miles north west of the coastal village of Brora in n the east of Sutherland, in the Highland area of Scotland. A quiet country lane can be followed along the eastern side of the loch, with fine views across the water to the surrounding hills, woodland and countryside. You could reach the loch by following the country lane from Brora train station if you prefer. This runs along the River Brora for a few miles before reaching the loch. The river is a popular place for salmon fishing - see the video below for more details.",
