  "description": "This beautiful loch is located a few miles north west of the coastal village of Brora in n the east of Sutherland, in the Highland area of Scotland. A quiet country lane can be followed along the eastern side of the loch, with fine views across the water to the surrounding hills, woodland and countryside. You could reach the loch by following the country lane from Brora train station if you prefer. This runs along the River Brora for a few miles before reaching the loch. The river is a popular place for salmon fishing - see the video below for more details.",

Also in Sutherland is the village of Golspie on the coast. Here you can enjoy a climb to Ben Bhraggie where you'll find the Sutherland monument and wonderful views over the area. A few miles to the south west you'll find the splendid Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve. The coastal reserve includes sand dunes and nature trails with seals, otters and various wildfowl to look out for on the way. The John O' Groats trail runs from Brora to Golspie with some splendid views over the Moray Firth. Here you could also visit the historic Dunrobin Castle. The 14th century castle has a fascinating history and some beautiful gardens to explore. The lovely waterfall on the Golspie Big Burn Walk can also be found in this area. Head north along the coast and you can visit the worthy village of Helmsdale. Here you can enjoy views of the pretty harbour and try the riverside walk along the River Helmsdale. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
