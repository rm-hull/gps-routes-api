    "description": "Explore the grounds of the largest castle in England and enjoy fabulous views of the White Cliffs of Dover. Highlights include the Secret Wartime Tunnels with a recreation of the Dunkirk evacuation in Operation Dynamo: Rescue from Dunkirk, complete with dramatic projections of swooping Spitfires and real film footage. In the Great Tower you can immerse yourself in the royal court of King Henry II with its richly furnished chambers adorned with vibrant wall hangings. The White Cliffs Country Trails and the Saxon Shore Way run past the castle so you could easily extend your walk. If you head east you can visit the Victorian South Foreland Lighthouse and the lovely Pines Gardens at St Margaret's. Our circular Dover Cliffs Walk starts from the National Trust visitor centre at Langdon Cliffs and will take you to come of the highlights of this section of the coast. To the west of the castle you can learn more about the military history of the area at the Western Heights . Here you will find a series of forts, strong points and ditches created during the 18th and 19th centuries to protect Dover from both seaward and landward attack.",
