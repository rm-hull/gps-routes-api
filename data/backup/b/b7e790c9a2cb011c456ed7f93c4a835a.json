This holloway is one of a number that climb diagonally up the edge of the Chiltern Escarpment. They are tracks which were originally eroded into the slope by people travelling between the Vale of Aylesbury and the flat summit of the hills - and the resulting deep groove could be several thousand years old, although may have been modified to make it suitable for forestry operations."

  "description": "Enjoy miles of great cycling and walking trails in this large forest in Buckinghamshire. The cycle trail is a moderate 5 mile route on waymarked surfaced tracks. It has some steep sections but is generally suitable for all abilities/families. For walkers there are several waymarked trails including a lovely easy access trail for all abilities. On the way you can see sculptures, deciduous trees, evergreen trees and many woodland flowers. There are also splendid views of the surrounding Chilterns countryside. Other attractions in the woods include a splendid cafe and a Go Ape forest adventure with Zip Wires, Tarzan Swings and a variety of Crossings. For children there is a fun Superworm trail from the creators of the Gruffalo. The woods also include the highest point in the Chilterns at Haddington Hill . If you'd like to continue your outing then several long distance trails run past the forest. You could pick up the Icknield Way Path , the Chiltern Link or The Ridgeway or head to the nearby Grand Union Canal and pick up the Wendover Canal Arm to visit Weston Turville Reservoir . The woods are located near Aylesbury and Tring. Heading north east along the Ridgeway will take you into Tring via the lovely Tring Park .",
