This is a 1960s concrete replica of a wooden trestle bridge that once carried the Lancaster Canal Tramroad across the river. The trail runs along the River Ribble through Avenham Park here. Preston is also notable as the midpoint of the National Cycle Network. The route has encouraged an increased interest in cycling in the Preston area. It's popularity has also led to proposals to create similar routes in nearby Blackburn, Leyland and Longridge."
