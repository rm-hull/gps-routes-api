  "description": "Enjoy a short walk around this pretty nature reserve near Blackpool. The reserve includes a large lake with a number of good footpaths running through the surrounding area. There's several bird hides where you can look out for the water loving birds which visit the mere. These include Great Crested Grebe, Coot, Moorhen, Shoveler, Pochard and Teal. Other features include reed beds, grassland, small areas of woodland and a variety of wildflowers. Look out for bee orchids, yellow rattle, marsh woundwort and birdsfoot trefoil in the summer months. These attract a large number of butterflies such as common blue, red admiral and meadow brown. It's easy to extend your walk on the paths which run to the north and west of the mere. These will take you around a golf course to the pretty Stanley Park where you will find a large boating lake and lovely gardens. Marton Mere is located just to the east of Blackpool town centre, near Staining. There are views of Blackpool Tower from the reserve. National Cycle Route 62 runs close to the site so you can easily cycle there too.",

Near here there's also Longton and the Longton Brickcroft Nature Reserve which includes picturesque ponds, pleasant footpaths and a visitor centre with displays about the reserve's habitats and wildlife.
