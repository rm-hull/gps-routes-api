  "description": "This route provides a link from the Bingley St Ives Estate to the Pennine Bridleway Mary Towneley Loop in Calderdale.  It is suitable for walkers and cyclists though a mountain bike is really needed due to the nature of some of the terrain on the path. You will pass Cullingworth and Oxenhope while there's some truly spectacular scenery as you pass the beautiful Leeming and Leeshaw Reservoirs before finishing near Gorple Reservoir and Widdop Reservoir .",
