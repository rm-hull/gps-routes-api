  "description": "This circular walk from Poynton visits Poynton Park and the Macclesfield Canal. There's nice waterside sections along Poynton Lake and the canal. You'll also enjoy fine views of the Cheshire countryside, some woodland sections and a stretch along the Poynton Brook. The walk starts in the pretty Poynton Park, just to the north of the town centre. You head east from the park and follow public footpaths through the countryside to the canal at Higher Poynton. Here you can pick up the towpath and follow it south to the Lyme View Marina and Adlington Basin. The marina is a very pretty spot on the canal and a nice place to stop and watch the boats go by. At the basin you leave the canal and head west to Wardsend and Poynton Brook. You follow a footpath along the brook before turning north to head through the town back to the park. To continue your walking in the area you could head east from the town and visit Lyme Park where there's miles of good trails to explore. Also of interest is the lovely Ladybrook Valley Interest Trail. This waymarked trail can be picked up on the northern side of the lake. It will take you west to Cheadle along the pretty Ladybrook.",
