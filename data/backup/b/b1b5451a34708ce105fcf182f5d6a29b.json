  "description": "This popular beauty spot on the River Wye is one of the highlights of the Peak District National Park. There's shady wooded valleys, rushing rivers and lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for on the way. This circular walk takes in Miller's Dale, Tideswell Dale and Monk's Dale. You'll also visit the 18th century Litton Mill and the village of Tideswell. Highlights on the route include the impressive Monsal trail viaduct and the limestone scenery in Tideswell Dale. The walk starts from the Miller's Dale car park. From here you can pick up the Monsal Trail to take you east towards Litton Mill. The mill was notorious for it's terrible treatment of the child workers. It has now been converted into apartments. You can virtually explore this part of the Monsal Trail using the google street view link below. At the mill the route then turns north following path through Tideswell Dale to the large village of Tideswell. This section is quite challenging with the village sitting in an elevated position of over 1000ft. Tideswell is a good place to stop for refreshments with plenty of pubs and cafes to choose from. From Tideswell you head west to Monk's Dale, part of the Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve. You head south through the woodland of the dale, leading you back to the car park.",
