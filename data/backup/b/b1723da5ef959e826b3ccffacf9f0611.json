By also linking with the Staffordshire & Worcestershire Canal at Stourton the canal was also able to offer an outlet for Dudley coal to the River Severn. The enterprise remained profitable until at least the 1930s, but in common with the rest of the narrow canal network suffered severe decline thereafter and was effectively abandoned by the 1960s. It was, however, restored and reopened for leisure craft in 1967. Here, at the end of the 2-mile arm into the centre of Stourbridge, there are moorings for privately owned narrowboats."

Head south of the town and you can visit the historic Hagley Hall Park and enjoy a climb to a splendid viewpoint at Clent Hills Country Park. Just to the south of the town there's the pretty Worcestershire village of Belbroughton with its attractive High Street and picturesque village green. Our circular walk visits the nearby village of Drayton with its scenic lake. To the east you can explore the woodland sculpture trails in the wildlife rich Saltwells Nature Reserve. You will also find the pretty Netherton Reservoir and the Dudley Canal in this area. The canal lies at the southern end of the Victorian Netherton Tunnel. With a torch you can walk through the pitch black tunnel to Dudley Port at the other end. For more walking ideas in the area see the West Midlands Walks and Staffordshire Walks pages."
