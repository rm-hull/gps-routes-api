  "description": "This circular walk explores the villages, rivers, canals and countryside surrounding the charming town of Henley in Arden in Warwickshire. It makes use of the Heart of England Way and the Stratford Upon Avon Canal to explore the area on good, waymarked footpaths. The walk starts in the attractive town centre where you will find the magnificent one mile high street with its collection of medieval buildings. Look out for several 15th, 16th and 17th century timber walled buildings, including the fine Guildhall. After admiring the architecture, the route then leaves the town, following the Heart of England Way in a north easterly direction towards Lowsonford . Here you pick up the canal towpath and follow it south towards the village of Preston Bagot. You'll pass the Yarningale Aqueduct, spanning the Kingswood Brook near the village of Claverdon . The route then heads through the countryside on public footpaths, returning to the town, via the site of the Norman Beaudesert Castle. The Arden Way long distance trail starts in the town. This is an excellent way of exploring the beautiful Forest of Arden, visiting Studley Castle , Coughton Court and the River Arrow. If you head south to Wootton Wawen , you can pick up the Monarch's Way . Here you can enjoy a nice walk along the River Alne. The Warwickshire Millennium Way also passes through the town.",
