  "description": "The Slindon Estate is a fantastic place for walkers and cyclists with miles of footpaths and bridleways to follow through the 1400 hectare estate. It is made up of a variety of habitats including woodland, downland, farmland, and parkland.  All the while there are wonderful views over the Weald, the South Downs and the coast with the Isle of Wight beyond. This circular walk starts at the village of Slindon on Butt Lane and climbs towards Bignor Hill and Gumber Corner. Here you pick up the Stane Street Roman Road and the Monarch's Way which leads you into a long woodland section through Nore Wood. It's a lovely section with bluebells, wild flowers and other woodland plants to enjoy. The final section takes you back to Slindon passing the eye-catching Nore Hill Folly. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head a few miles to the east and enjoy a walk around Arundel Castle and Arundel Park with a riverside stretch along the River Arun. This route skirts the edge of Eartham Woods which has bluebells and deer to look out for. Houghton Forest is also close by and has more mountain bike trails to try. The Slindon Estate is located close to Chichester, Arundel and Bognor Regis .",
