  "description": "This challenging walk explores the North Berwyn Mountains, to the south of the River Dee, in Denbighshire. The route starts in Llangollen and heads west to Corwen , passing Ceiriog Forest and Cynwyd before a final waterside section along the River Dee takes you to Corwen. The area of the Berwyn Mountains is wild and covered in thick heather with some acidic grassland and bracken. The views of North Wales from the peaks are spectacular. The walk is waymarked with a blue and white disc.",
