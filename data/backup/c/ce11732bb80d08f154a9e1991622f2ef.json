On the flat-topped summit is an Iron Age fort dating from 600 BC, with the impressive ramparts of later 2nd century AD Roman forts immediately to the north and south. New research suggests that Burnswark may have been the location for the 10th century Battle of Brunanburh, previously thought to have been in England."

  "description": "This walk climbs to the fine viewpoint at Burnswark Hill near Lockerbie in Dumfries and Galloway. The hill is of some archeological significance having been the site of ancient Iron Age fort. There's also evidence of a Bronze Age burial cairn, Roman camps, some medieval enclosures and a potential Civil War battery in this fascinating area. From the 287 metre high summit there are also some great views over the surrounding countryside and hills of Annandale.",

The trail provides great views of the River Annan which flows through the area.
