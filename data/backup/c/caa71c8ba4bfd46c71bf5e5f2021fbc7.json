It is however closed each March, so that the toads found in the swamp-like area, which the ford crosses, can breed."

  "description": "This Nottinghamshire village is based near Southwell and Lowdham. This walk from the village takes you west to visit the Oxton Bogs and the old Calverton coal mine to the west of the settlement. There's some nice footpaths in this area with lakes, a ford, an old railway line and views over the surrounding countryside to enjoy on the way. To continue your walking in the area head north west to visit Blidworth Woods. Here you can enjoy some peaceful woodland trails and pick up the long distance Robin Hood Way to explore the surrounding Sherwood Forest area. Burntstump Country Park lies just to the west and is another local walking highlight.",
