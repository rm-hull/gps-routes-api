  "description": "This village is located just east of Crowborough in the Wealden District of East Sussex. The village is a good based for exploring the nearby Ashdown Forest and the High Weald AONB where there are numerous walking options. In the village there's an attactive green, a fine 17th century pub and a noteworthy church which dates to the 11th century and is Grade I listed. This circular walk in the village takes you across the Rotherfield Millennium Green to nearby Town Row before returning on a countryside path. The green was created in 2000 to provide the residents with a pleasant green space for walks. It includes a pond, grassland, an ancient oak, a heritage orchard and lots of wildlife. There's also grazing meadows and a stream which eventually leads into the River Grom and Medway. The paths lead to Town Row where there's some pretty cottages and a photogenic old oast house. There's also the old railway station which formed part off the Cuckoo Line before closing in 1965. The station is now a private house. To continue your walking in the area head north to Eridge Rocks. The nature reserve is one of the area highlights with its huge boulders and varied flora.",
