The walk follows a scenic route along the brook, extending across the London Borough of Barnet. Originally developed in the 1930s as the Brookside Walk, it was an initiative led by Finchley Councillor Alfred Pike. The trail originally traced the path of Mutton Brook westward before merging with the Dollis Brook, continuing north to Wyatts Farm Open Space near the Finchley boundary. In collaboration with the Countryside Commission (now Natural England) and the Countryside Management Service, the London Borough of Barnet later expanded and transformed the walk into the Dollis Valley Greenwalk."

In 2009, the Greenwalk received a \u00a3400,000 grant from the Mayor of London's Help a London Park Scheme after a successful public vote. This funding was used for a wide range of improvements, such as enhancing footpaths and cycle routes, adding lighting and signage, and upgrading accessibility. It also supported habitat creation, including wetlands and reedbeds, as well as the preservation of hay meadows. The overall aim was to make the walk more enjoyable and educational by adding information boards and points of interest throughout the route."

You will pass through Scratchwood and Moat Mount Open Space and Barnet's Totteridge Fields Nature Reserve on this flat easy walk through North London. The route is good for flora and fauna too. Look out for herons, nesting swans, ducks and ducklings along the brook. There's also attractive woodland, wild garlic and wild flowers dotted along the pathway.",

There's a good range of snack and an outdoor seating area to relax in warmer days. You can find it at postcode NW5 1QR for your sat navs. There's an abundance of fine cafes and pubs around the heath as well. One noteworthy place worth consideration is The Spaniards Inn. The pub dates from 1585 and has some interesting literary connections. John Keats apparently penned Ode to a Nightingale in the garden and the pub is also mentioned in Charles Dickens\u2019 Pickwick Papers. There's an attractive interior with oak-panelled walls, chandeliers, beams and log fires. Outside there's a nice garden with a BBQ on warmer days. You can find the inn on Spaniards Road at the north western end of the heath. Postcode for your sat nav is NW3 7JJ. Also worthy of consideration is the The Orange Tree in Totteridge. It's in a lovely spot right next to the village pond where you can watch the birds on the water. There's an elegant interior and outdoor seating if the weather is good. You can find them at a postcode of N20 8NX for your sat navs. The village is also well worth exploring. It has a lovely rural feel with a pretty village green, a cricket pitch and some pleasant local countryside. There's also the Darland's Lake Nature Reserve where there are some lovely waterside trails and lots of wildlife to see."

There's nice trails here around the lake and woodland in the park. Another brookside walk starts just to the east of the route in New Barnet. The Pymmes Brook Trail runs from Monken Hadley Common in Hadley Wood to Picket's Lock near Enfield. It's a similar route along one of the tributaries of the River Lea. For more walking ideas in the area see the London Walks and Hertfordshire Walks pages."
