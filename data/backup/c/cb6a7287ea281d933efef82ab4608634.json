The walk follows a scenic route along the brook, extending across the London Borough of Barnet. Originally developed in the 1930s as the Brookside Walk, it was an initiative led by Finchley Councillor Alfred Pike. The trail originally traced the path of Mutton Brook westward before merging with the Dollis Brook, continuing north to Wyatts Farm Open Space near the Finchley boundary. In collaboration with the Countryside Commission (now Natural England) and the Countryside Management Service, the London Borough of Barnet later expanded and transformed the walk into the Dollis Valley Greenwalk."

In 2009, the Greenwalk received a \u00a3400,000 grant from the Mayor of London's Help a London Park Scheme after a successful public vote. This funding was used for a wide range of improvements, such as enhancing footpaths and cycle routes, adding lighting and signage, and upgrading accessibility. It also supported habitat creation, including wetlands and reedbeds, as well as the preservation of hay meadows. The overall aim was to make the walk more enjoyable and educational by adding information boards and points of interest throughout the route."

  "description": "This pleasant walk takes you from Mill Hill near Edgware in North London to the edge of Hampstead Heath along the Dollis Brook. You will pass through Scratchwood and Moat Mount Open Space and Barnet's Totteridge Fields Nature Reserve on this flat easy walk through North London. The route is good for flora and fauna too. Look out for herons, nesting swans, ducks and ducklings along the brook. There's also attractive woodland, wild garlic and wild flowers dotted along the pathway.",
