His most prominent achievement was the construction of the railway from Betws y Coed towards Blaenau Ffestiniog which includes this long viaduct that takes the railway from one side of the Lledr valley to the other."

    "description": "This walk takes you through the stunning scenery of the River Lledr Gorge in Dolwyddelan, Conwy. You can start the walk from the Pont-y-Pant railway station on the Conwy Valley line. Then follow the riverside path east through the wooded gorge to the picturesque waterfalls, stepping stones and the Pont Gethin viaduct. On the opposite side of the river there's the Fisherman's Walk along a rickety old pathway. It's not for the faint hearted but does provide excellent views down the river. See the video below for an idea of what you can expect if you take this precarious Victorian pathway through the gorge. You can extend the walk by continuing east along the river to visit Fairy Glen. The delightful glen is one of the major highlights of the area. The walk could also be started from Dolwyddelan where you can explore the historic Dolwyddelan Castle .",
