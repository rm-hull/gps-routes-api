These ancient stone structures, dating back to the Iron Age, typically served multiple purposes, including habitation and possible defensive capabilities. Dun Beag, specifically, is notable for its impressive construction, featuring walls that are approximately 4.3 metres thick and an interior diameter of around 11 metres. The entrance is accessed through a narrow passage, and the broch includes a small chamber and a stone staircase leading to the upper levels"

Excavations in the early 20th century uncovered various artefacts, including pottery and coins from later periods, indicating it was occupied or visited well beyond the Iron Age. Originally, Dun Beag would have stood much taller, potentially reaching over 10 metres, and likely featured a thatched roof, making it a prominent landmark in the landscape."

There is a car park just to the south of the site where you can start your walk. From here follow footpaths north east up to the Iron Age remains of the broch. From the elevated ancient ruins there are some splendid views to the coast and surrounding hills. To continue your walking in the area head south east to visit the delightful Fairy Pools .",
