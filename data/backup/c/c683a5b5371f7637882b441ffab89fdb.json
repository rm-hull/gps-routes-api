At Tickenham it powered a watermill which is probably of medieval origin; the watercourse may therefore be medieval too. The road connects Nailsea to Clevedon and the M5 Motorway, going south.

  "description": "This North Somerset town has a lovely local sculpture trail, an Iron Age Hillfort and a nearby National Trust property to explore on foot. This walk from the town visits some of the local walking highlights including the Ty Sculpture Trail, Cadbury Camp and the National Trust's Clevedon Court. The walk starts from the splendid Ty Sculpture Trail on the northern outskirts of the town. Here you'll find a delightful woodland area with a number of interesting sculptures, ponds, the Land Yeo river and a cafe. After exploring the site you can follow country lanes north west to meet up with the Gordano Round and follow it towards Cadbury Camp. The site dates back to Neolithic times and is run by the National Trust. The views are extensive with the Mendips, the Quantocks, Exmoor and Flat and Steep Holm in the Severn Estuary to see from the summit. The route then continues west along the waymarked footpath to visit Clevedon Court. There's an 18th century garden, woodland trails and acres of parkland surrounding this fine 14th century manor house. After exploring the grounds you return to Nailsea on the same paths.",
