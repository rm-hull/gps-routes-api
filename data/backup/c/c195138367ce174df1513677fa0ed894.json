  "description": "Explore the woodlands, ponds, orchards and wildflower meadows in this country park near Gravesend. Walkers can enjoy a number of waymarked surfaced paths and an 8km grass trail. There are also easy surfaced paths for cyclists. These are good for families looking for a safe ride. There's lots to see with 100 acres of meadowland with over 40 species of wildflower. You can also explore the orchards with apple, plum, cherry and pear trees. At Henhurst Lake you can look out for water loving wildlife while the woodland area and glades are a lovely tranquil place for a stroll too. If you'd like to extend your outing then you could head to the nearby Shorne Woods Country Park where you'll find 288 acres of rolling woodlands, wetlands and meadows. Our Circular Walk around Cobham visits Shorne Woods, Jeskyns Park and also takes you to Cobham Woods which is run by the National Trust. Just east of the woods there's also Ashenbank Wood which has some lovely bluebells in spring.",
