  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful Falls of Feugh in Banchory, Aberdeenshire. The falls are located just to the south of the town, next to the Bridge of Feugh. The bridge spans the Water of Feugh which is the largest\u00a0tributary\u00a0to the\u00a0River Dee. It rises in the\u00a0Grampian Mountains, in the\u00a0Forest of Birse, and has a particularly scenic aspect in a series of\u00a0cascades\u00a0at the Bridge of Feugh slightly above its point of discharge to the Dee. There is a free car park just to the east of the bridge where you can start the walk. From here it is just a short stroll to bridge where you can watch salmon climb the natural leap as they make their way up the Falls during spawning season. You can continue the walk by heading a short distance north to the Bridge of Dee and picking up a footpath along the River Dee. After watching the falls there is a lovely tea room nearby where you can enjoy refreshments. To continue your walking around Banchory head to Drum Castle . The 13th century castle near Drumoak\u00a0has some lovely walking trails to follow through the grounds and surrounding woodland.  The 16th century Crathes Castle is also nearby. There's 600 acres of formal gardens, woodland and rolling countryside to explore on a number of footpaths here.",
