  "description": "Follow the Jubilee Way through Leicestershire and into Lincolnshire on this delightful walk. The walk starts off at the beautiful Burrough Hill Country Park and heads to Melton Mowbray passing Little Dalby on the way. You continue north through Melton Country Park, with its pretty lakes, before joining the Scalford Brook which takes you to Scalford. The path continues through Eaton and then to a pleasant wooded section through Barkestone Wood that leads to the impressive Belvoir Castle. This 19th century castle has a splendid interior with grand State Rooms and several notable paintings by Gainsborough. The gardens are also beautifully laid out making the castle a real highlight on the trail. The walk finishes soon after at the pretty village of Woolsthorpe by Belvoir .",
