  "description": "This delightful picture postcard village is located in the Dorset AONB. The village was designed by the famous Capability Brown and includes several photogenic thatched cottages and an historic abbey school. This circular walk from the village visits Milton Abbey School, the remains of Milton Abbey, Hilton and Bingham's Melcombe. The walk starts in the village and follows a footpath north west along Milton Lake to the school. The site includes a 15th-century dining hall, an Abbey chapel that can be traced back to the 10th century and grounds designed by Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown. You then continue north east along a country lane to the village of Hilton where there's more thatched properties to see. The route then heads south west to visit Bingham's Melcombe, passing through pockets of woodland as you go. There's a fine 14th century church and nice trails along the Devil's Brook where there's a series of waterfalls. The route then heads east, passing Combe Hill and Melmoth's Hill forestry area before returning to Milton Lake at Luscombe Down.",
