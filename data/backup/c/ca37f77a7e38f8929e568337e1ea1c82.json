  "description": "Visit the site of the earliest settlement of Salisbury on this fascinating walk in Wiltshire.  Here you can see the exposed foundations of the former cathedral and climb the mighty ramparts for splendid views of the surrounding Wiltshire Plains. There's  29 acres of beautiful rare grass chalkland to explore on a number of good footpaths. Look out for butterflies and kestrels, which can often be seen hovering over the outer bailey. The Old Sarum Way long distance footpath runs past the site so you can pick this up to extend your walk. You can virtually explore the site using the google street view link below!",
