  "description": "This village near Bath is located in a lovely spot, next to a canalized section of the River Avon. Saltford is also notable for its 12th century Manor House which claims to be the oldest continuously occupied dwelling in England. This route from the village uses parts of the Bristol and Bath Railway Path , the River Avon Trail and the Two Rivers Way to create a circular walk through the surrounding area. On the way you'll visit Avon Valley Country Park and the neighbouring town of Keynsham . The walk starts on the River Avon, just to the east of the village. Here you can pick up the Bristol and Bath Railway Path and follow the shared cycling and walking trail north along a disused railway line. This will take you up to the river, passing the Avon Valley Country Park on the way. The park has a number of attractions including surfaced country walks, a boating lake, play areas for children, a small petting zoo and a miniature railway. This route picks up the River Avon Trail and follows the path west towards Keynsham. Here you can pick up the Two Rivers Way and follow another footpath south along the River Chew to Chewton Keynsham. The route then turns east to follow country lanes back into Saltford.",
