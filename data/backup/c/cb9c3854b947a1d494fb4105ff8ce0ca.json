The building glimpsed on the horizon (at left, in adjacent grid square), located high above the village, is Trafalgar Court. When the railway opened in 1889 - bringing visitors wishing to sample the fresh sea air - the village of Mundesley grew rapidly. The railway is now long gone but Mundesley is still considered to be one of the best a holiday resorts in Norfolk, offering a sandy beach with safe swimming for children when the tide is out; the East Norfolk Coast Path/Peddars Way follows the coastline and offers splendid views across the North Sea. Properties date mainly from Victorian times and many houses are constructed from traditional Norfolk materials such as flint and brick, with thatch or pantile roofs. The village contains a small number of shops, eating places, pubs, tea rooms and possibly the smallest museum in the country, the Maritime Museum. Several holiday parks are in the vicinity of the village, the largest one being Mundesley Holiday Village, located a short distance to the southeast."

As a result of a drowning and near drowning in 1971 of a man and his wife half a mile off the beach at Mundesley, the Mundesley Parish Council called a meeting to discuss the feasibility of establishing an Inshore Lifeboat at Mundesley. It was decided to set up an independent rescue unit, funded and manned from within the village. In the spring of 1972, a Zodiac inflatable was borrowed from a local businessman and established in a temporary boathouse on the promenade at the east end of the village, followed by the purchase of a 4M Avon Sea Rider semi- rigid inflatable wholly owned by the Service. A wooden site hut was donated by a Bacton Gas Site contractor and converted into a boathouse. The boat is on call 365 days per year, 24 hours a day."

  "description": "This lovely seaside village has some nice coastal trails to follow in both directions. It is part of the\u00a0Norfolk Coast AONB where there's some wonderful coastal scenery. This walk follows the England Coast Path south east to the nearby village of Bacton. The route runs for just over 2 miles on a flat path running along the beaches. As such it's suitable for all abilities. This route uses part of the Paston Way long distance trail. To continue your walking in the area you could follow the waymarked path to the North Walsham and Dilham Canal and the Pretty Pigney's Wood Nature Reserve. You can follow the path through the countryside from Bacton, passing Knapton and the noteworthy Bacton Woods on the way. The attractive woods have 30 species of tree, including Scots and Corsian Pine, Western Hemlock, Douglas Fir and Larch. Near North Walsham you can also pick up the Weavers' Way long distance footpath. You could also head along the England Coast Path in the other direction. This will take you to Overstrand where you can pick try the Cromer to Overstrand Walk . This takes you along a super cliff top path with great views over the area.",
