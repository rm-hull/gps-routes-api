Near the visitor centre there's also the delightful St Helen's Picnic Site if you'd prefer to bring your own food. The site is located in a lovely spot in Santon Downham next to the River Ouse. There's free parking and a number of good walking trails branching off from the site. Snowdrops can also be seen at in the early spring in the woodland opposite the village shop. You can find the site at Santon Downham with postcode IP27 0TJ for your sat navs. Also in the village you a visit to the noteworthy Santon Downham Church is worth a little of your time. Dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, parts of this church date back to the 12th century, although the tower was built in the 15th century. To the south there's the Elveden Estate where there's miles of walking trails surrounding the historic Georgian mansion. The estate also includes a number of fine shops selling quality produce, the excellent Elveden Courtyard restaurant and the Elveden Inn. The inn is considered to be the 'home of Guinness' in England as the estate is the seat of a direct descendant of the Guinness family. You can find them just a few miles north east of the walk in the village of Elveden at postcode IP24 3TJ."

      "content": "One nice idea is to pick up the St Edmund Way at Thetford Priory and follow the waymarked trail south through the King's Forest to West Stow Country Park and Lackford Lakes Nature Reserve. There's some nice waterside trails here around the park's lakes and along the River Lark which runs through the area. For cyclists try the Thetford Cycle Loop to extend your exercise. This 30 mile waymarked trail takes you around the forest, visiting several villages, heaths, nature reserves and rivers. There's also the long distance Rebellion Way Cycle Route. The epic 232 mile circular ride visits some of the major highlights of Norfolk, using a series of quiet country lanes and traffic free paths."
