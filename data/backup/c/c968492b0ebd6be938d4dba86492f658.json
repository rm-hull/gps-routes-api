A Roman camp exists in the neighbourhood, and there are traces of numerous lead and silver mines, supposed to have been worked by the Romans and Britons.\""

  "description": "This Somerset based village is a fine place to start a walk with some fascinating ancient sites, wildlife rich nature reserves and murky limestone caverns to explore. There's also some fine country walking in the surrounding Mendips Hills to enjoy. The village sits at an elevation of nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea-level, meaning it is located at one of the highest points in the hills. This circular walk from the village visits some of the local highlights including the ancient Priddy Nine Barrows, the Priddy Mineries Nature Reserve,  the Ebbor Gorge National Nature Reserve and the mysterious Wookey Hole near Wells. The walk starts in the village and heads north towards Townsend and the Priddy Pool. Here you pick up Nine Barrows Lane and follow it north east towards Cranmore view. From here you can pick up a footpath heading south to Priddy Nine Barrows. The Barrows are a Bronze Age cemetery and are on open ground at just over 300m above sea level. From the elevated position there are splendid views over the Somerset countryside. The route continues south through the Priddy Mineries where there's a series of pools and lots of wildlife to look out for. Here you pick up the Monarch's Way and continue south to Dursdon Wood and the Ebbor Gorge. This scenic limestone gorge inlcludes streams, woodland and a wide variety of plants and flowers. In the gorge you can pick up the West Mendip Way and follow the waymarked footpath towards Wookey Hole and the Wookey Hole Caves attraction. For a fee you can explore the caves which have been used by humans for around 45,000 years. The route then continues north along the West Mendip way to take you back to Priddy, via Dursdon Drove and Pelting Drove.",
