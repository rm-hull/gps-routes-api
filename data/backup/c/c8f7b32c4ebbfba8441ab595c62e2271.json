  "description": "This circular walk climbs to the viewpoint at Old Pale Hill in Delamere Forest . The walk starts from Delamere train station but you could also start it at the visitor centre car park nearer to the hill. From here you head south west up to Pale Heights where there are fabulous panoramic views over the area. On a clear day you can see the Manchester skyline, Merseyside and and the mountains of North Wales. In all seven counties are visible from here including Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire, Shropshire and Staffordshire in England, and Denbighshire and Flintshire in Wales. At the top there's also a stone marker displaying the elevation of 176 metres which is the high point of the northern mass of the Mid Cheshire Ridge. There's also three transmitter masts which carry radio, television and telephone signals. After taking in the views the route descends to the north, following woodland trails to the pretty Blakemere Moss Lake. There's a nice trail heading east along the lake which will take you back to the train station.",
