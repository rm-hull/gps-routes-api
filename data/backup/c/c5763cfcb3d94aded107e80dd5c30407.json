  "description": "Explore this wonderful coastal nature reserve on this circular walk in Kent. The reserve contains a number of lakes and lagoons with several miles of good footpaths to follow around the expansive site. There's also coastal paths with great views of the sea and the long stretch of shingle beach. The reserve is superb for wildlife watching with lots of birds to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for lapwings, smew, bittern and little ringed plover from one of the many bird hides. There's also over 600 different types of plant species. The RSPB site has good facilities with a car park and visitor centre. You can start the walk from the car park off Dungeness Road, about a mile east of Lydd. From here you can pick up the trails taking you around the lakes to the coast. The path then heads south along Broomhill Sands to the village of Lydd-on-Sea, the lifeboat station and the lighthouse. The route then follows path across Denge Beach back to the car park. On this section you pass the nuclear power stations which warm the water in the area attracting large numbers of birds. Also of intrest is the The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. The narrow gauge railway was built in 1927 and is a fun way to see the area. To extend your walk you can pick up the England Coast Path and follow it west to Camber Sands and Rye Harbour. Here you will find saltmarsh, lagoons, grazing marsh, shingle and reedbeds with a huge variety of flora and fauna. You can also head to the nearby New Romney and explore Romney Marsh .",
