During the past decade the shed was used for stabling horses and donkeys, but, in August 2006, it was gutted by fire. The railway line ran along the now grassed area parallel with the building and was separated from the adjoining road by a slate fence."

  "description": "This walk explores the fascinating old Dinorwic Slate Quarry in Llanberis. At one time the quarry was the second largest slate quarry in the world, after the nearby Penrhyn quarry at Bethesda. The site is now home to the National Slate Museum, covering more than 700 acres (283 ha) consisting of two main quarry sections with 20 galleries in each. The site is a fine place to explore on foot with towering walls of slate backed the mountains of Snowdonia. The walk starts from Dinowic parking area at the western end of the site, just above Llyn Padarn. From here you can pick up the village tramway trail and follow it south east across the quarries towards Nant Peris. Around here you can pick up trails along Llyn Peris before heading back to the car park.",
