  "description": "This Yorkshire port city has some fine riverside trails and pictureque local parks to explore on foot. This walk from the Paragon train station follows a section of the Trans Pennine Trail along the docks on the River Humber. On the way you'll cross the River Hull and visit the Victoria Docks and the adjacent Victoria Park. The route then continues to Alexandra Dock. Walk highlights include The Deep, a huge aquarium with over 3500 fish. You can find them at Sammy's Point, at the confluence of the River Hull and the Humber Estuary just after you cross the River Hull. See the video below for a virtual walk taking you to the historic buildings and landmarks in this fascinating city.",
