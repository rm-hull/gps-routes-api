The park also contains a Visitor Centre, Cafeteria, Peace Garden and Nature trails. National Cycle Network number 75 runs along the southern edge of the park and there is another cycle path running through the park up to the loch.

The loch is part of the wider Seven Lochs Wetland Park, Scotland's largest urban heritage and nature park. It's a great area for walks and bird watching with several species visiting the lochs. If you head east towards Bathgate you can explore Polkemmet Country Park. You could also pick up the Airdrie to Bathgate Cycle Path and visit the pretty Hillend Reservoir. North of the park you can pick up the Strathkelvin Railway Path near Gartcosh. This shared cycling and walking route runs along a disused railway line to Strathblane, with lovely views of the Campsie Fells on the way."
