  "description": "Explore 500 acres of lowland heath, mixed woodlands, lochs and open grassland in this pretty country park located between Glasgow and Airdrie. You can follow the woodland paths to Lochend Loch and Woodend Loch before enjoying a stroll along the Monkland Canal which runs through the southern end of the park.  The park also contains a Visitor Centre, Cafeteria, Peace Garden and Nature trails. National Cycle Network number 75 runs along the southern edge of the park and there is another cycle path running through the park up to the loch. The park is located just to the west of Coatbridge very near to Blairhill railway which is a good point of access.",
