  "description": "This shared cycling and walking route follows the Padiham Greenway in the town of Padiham, near Burnley. The traffic free route runs along the track bed of the old Burnley to Padiham railway. Starting from Mollywood Lane in Rose Grove the route will take you north  to Padiham Memorial Park and the River Calder. The Greenway is a nice, safe route with views of the countryside and River Calder. It's a good surface which is also suitable for walkers. The Padiham Greenway is part of the National Cycle Network as route number 685. It links with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and also has a branch to the nearby Gawthorpe Hall ."
