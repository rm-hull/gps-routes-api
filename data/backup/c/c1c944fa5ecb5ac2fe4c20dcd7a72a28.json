  "description": "This is a lovely riverside walk to the picturesque Stotfold Mill in Bedfordshire near Baldock and Letchworth. The walk starts from the public parking area next to Ford Bridge in the village. From here you head south along the Kingfisher Way and the River Ivel to Ford Bridge and the mill near Radwell. The restored Grade II listed mill includes a 4.4 metre wide corn mill waterwheel which is the widest in the country. On open days you can explore the 3 floors of the watermill and learn all about the history of the milling process. There's also an adjacent 8 acre nature reserve with a wildflower meadow and lots of wildlife to look out for. You continue south along the river to Norton Mill and the village of Norton Bury. The route then heads back towards Radwell on footpaths on the western side of the river. You then retrace your steps back to Stotfold village.",

      "content": "If you continue south along the Kingfisher Way you can visit the market town of Baldock. Here you'll find some excellent architecture, including Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian buildings. Just to the north east there's the picturesque village of Ashwell to explore. There's a Tudor museum, a 14th century church and the interesting Ashwell Springs to see. This biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, is notable as a source of the River Cam. Near here you'll also find the pretty village of Therfield and the popular Royston Heath. The heath is well worth a vist with its fine viewpoint and interesting wildlife. The site also includes a decent on site cafe with outdoor seating overlooking the heath. To the west is the small town of Arlesey where you can explore the Arlesey Old Moat Nature Reserve on the River Hiz. Near here there's Henlow where there's a noteworthy 12th century church and the Champneys Health farm which is used by the rich and famous. For more walking ideas in the area see the Chilterns Walks and Bedfordshire Walks pages."
