  "description": "Enjoy waterside walking in this nature reserve in Thrapston, near Kettering. There are several large lakes to stroll around and you can also follow the Nene Way along the River Nene which runs through the reserve. Large numbers of wildfowl can be seen on the water including heron, goosander, wigeon, gadwal, reed warbler and sedge warbler. Along the river Nene you can look out for butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could follow the Nene Way to Stanwick Lakes and Rushden Lakes for more birdlife and lovely waterside walks.",

You can pick up the Lyveden Way at Wadenhoe just to the north to visit the park. This fine trail will also take you to the National Trust's Lyveden Estate. Here you'll find a fine Elizabethan lodge and moated garden with a fascinating history. Just to the south you can pick up the Ringstead Circular Walk which explores the pretty Kinewell Lake and the neighbouring villages of Woodford and Denford.
