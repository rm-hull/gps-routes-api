The Inn was built circa 1900 replacing an older one of the same name that had been erected sometime in the late 18th/early 19th century to serve a London-Brighton turnpike that passed along the course of the current A273. It also has a literary connection appearing in Conan Doyle's story 'Rodney Stone'."

The South Street/High Street route was the part of the original London-Brighton turnpike constructed in 1770. I believe the blue car is a Rolls Royce though I have no idea of make or model."

Jill is the post mill in the foreground and is actually the older of the two having been built in 1821 in Dyke Road in Brighton. Known as Lashmars mill it was purchased by the then owner of Jack in 1852 to increase his milling production. The windmill was dismantled, moved by oxen and reassembled on the site. It stopped working in 1906. Since 1978 it has been restored by a team volunteers and is open to the public most weekends from May to September."

  "description": "This West Sussex based village is in a great location for exploring some of the local highlights of the South Downs. There's also some history with a noteworthy Anglo-Saxon church and a fine former coaching inn for refreshments afterwards. This circular walk from the town visits Wolstonbury Hill, the Clayton Windmills and the popular Ditchling Beacon. The walk starts from the train station and heads east to Keymer and Ditchling village. Here you pick up the Sussex Border Path and follow the waymarked footpath south to the Ditchling Beacon Nature Reserve where there's a wide variety of wildlife to see. If you head east from here along The South Downs Way it will take you up to Ditchling Beacon where there are excellent views over the Downs. After enjoying the views you head west along the South Downs Way towards the Clayton Windmills. These are something of a local Hassocks landmark and are known as Jack and Jill. Continue west past Wellcombe Bottom and you will soon come to Wolstonbury Hill, another excellent viewpoint in the area. The route then descends to the north to follow New Way Lane into Hurstpierpoint. From here you head east past Hurst Wickham Stables before coming into Hassocks.",
