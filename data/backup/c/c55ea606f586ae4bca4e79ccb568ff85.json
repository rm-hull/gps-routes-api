Today it is occupied by a soft-drinks manufacturer and a variety of small businesses and studios. The buildings date from the 19th Century, and incorporate a much earlier clothier's house dating from the 17th century. The Woodchester area was ideal for cloth manufacture because of deep valleys and rapid streams in this part of the Cotswolds."
