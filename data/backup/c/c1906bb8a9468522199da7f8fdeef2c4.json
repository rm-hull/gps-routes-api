  "description": "Enjoy several miles of lovely, waterside walking and cycling in this country park in Nottingham.  The park contains two large lakes, a marina, woodland and meadows.  The River Trent also runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along the Trent Valley Way walking route. There is also an excellent visitor centre with cycle hire available. To extend your exercise you could visit the nearby Holme Pierrepont Country Park where there are more good cycling and walking trails. You could also head to Broxtowe Country Park where there's some nice woodland trails and a BMX track to try. The park is located to the south of Nottingham city centre near to Nottingham Midland Railway station.",
