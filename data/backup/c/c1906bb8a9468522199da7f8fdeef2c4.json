  "description": "Enjoy several miles of lovely, waterside walking and cycling in this country park in Nottingham. The park contains two large lakes, a marina, woodland and meadows. The River Trent also runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along the Trent Valley Way walking route. There is also an excellent visitor centre with cycle hire available. To extend your exercise you could visit the nearby Holme Pierrepont Country Park where there are more good cycling and walking trails. You could also head to Broxtowe Country Park where there's some nice woodland trails and a BMX track to try. The park is located to the south of Nottingham city centre near to Nottingham Midland Railway station.",

The area also includes the Rockley Memorial Park where you'll find lovely gardens in a peaceful setting. Just to the north there's several good waymarked trails to be found at Gedling Country Park. There's also some fine views over the city from the high points on the site. To the south there's Cotgrave Country Park. This park was developed on a former colliery site and includes woodland and wetland trails. The Grantham Canal can also be picked up here and followed to Hickling where there's a fine 18th century canalside pub. The West Bridgford Walk visits the park by following the Trent Valley Way along the river from the market town. There's a nice riverside pub you could visit here with views over the Trent to Nottingham. For more walking ideas in the area see the Nottinghamshire Walks page."
