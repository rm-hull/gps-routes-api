  "description": "Sulby Reservoir is located near the villages of Welford and Naseby in Northamptonshire. They provide water to the summit level of the Grand Union Canal by way of the navigable Welford Arm. This circular walk visits both Welford and Sulby Reservoir before following waymarked trails to Sibbertoft. The route starts at the car park at the western end of Welford Reservoir. From here you can pick up the Jurassic Way and follow it north east to Sibbertoft. The village is a good place to stop for refreshments at what is roughly the half way point of the walk. From the village you can pick up bridleways heading south west through the countryside towards Welford. At the Naseby Road you pick up a section of Shakespeare's Avon Way which you can follow along the River Avon towards Welford and then back up to the car park. The walk passes along Naseby Field, site of the 1645 Battle of Naseby. You can extend your walking in the area by try our Naseby Battlefield Walk which visits the reservoirs.",
