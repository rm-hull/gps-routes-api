  "description": "This circular walk explores the beautiful Wiltshire countryside surrounding the town of Calne. There's much to enjoy with rivers, lakes, woodland trails and a visit to the splendid Bowood House . The walk starts on the western edge of the town and follows Wenhill Lane south west to to Pinhills Farm before entering the expansive Bowood Park. The 18th century Georgian country House is surrounded by beautiful grounds with public footpaths running through the western side of the park. You'll pass Bowood Lake and the landscape gardens designed by Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown as you make your way across the estate. The trail then heads north through the park towards Derry Hill and Studley where you pick up some quiet country lanes. They'll take you up to Hazeland Farm where you cross the River Marden on Hazeland Bridge. You then turn south through Ratford with more river views before turning east and returning to Calne. This section passes the route of the old Calne branch of the now closed Wilts and Berks Canal.",
