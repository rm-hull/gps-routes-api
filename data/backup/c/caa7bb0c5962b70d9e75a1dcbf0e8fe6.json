  "description": "This pretty little South Oxfordshire village is located in the Chiltern Hills near the town of Wallingford. The historic village includes some attractive thatched cottages, a notable 12th century Norman church and the 17th century Ipsden House. This circular walk from the village takes you east to explore Ipsden Heath. The heath has some good footpaths taking you through bluebell woodland and pasture with some fine views of the surrounding Chiltern Hills countryside. On the walk look out for wildlife including Red kites and buzzards which can often be seen soaring in the skies above. There's also an optional extension to visit the neighbouring village of Stoke Row where there are some interesting historical features. The village includes the distinctive Maharajah's Well, a pretty cherry orchard and a noteworthy 17th century pub reputed to be the former haunt of notorious highwayman Dick Turpin. To continue your walking from Ipsden you could pick up the long distance Swan's Way just to the west. If you were to follow the waymarked path north you could link up with The Ridgeway National Trail. Heading west would take you to Wallingford where you could enjoy a riverside walk along the Thames Path .",
