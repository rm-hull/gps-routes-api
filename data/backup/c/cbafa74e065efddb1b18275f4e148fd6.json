  "description": "A coastal walk from the beach at Mawgan Porth to the Bedruthan Steps in Cornwall. It's just under 2 miles from the beach to the steps so just under 4 miles there and back. The walk starts from the car park at Mawgan Porth where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it north. The trail runs along the beach passing Trenance Point and Carnewas Island before coming to the steps. Here you'll find a series of large rocks along the beach and great views towards Carnewas Island and Trescore Islands. The area is also covered with attractive wildflowers which attract a variety of butterflies and birds. Depending on the tides you can follow a staircase down to a secluded beach next to the rocks. If you continue north you can visit Porthcothan where there's a picturesque cove, a lovely sandy beach, some splendid rock formations and lush grassy dunes",
