  "description": "This river walk visits some of the highlights of the area around Caerleon including the Roman Fortress, Chepstow Hill and Wentwood Forest. The walk starts in the town at the notable\u00a0Roman\u00a0legionary\u00a0fortress. You then follow paths to the river, passing the Roman Amphitheatre on the way. At the river you pick up the Usk Valley Walk and follow the waymarked trail along the river before picking up the old Roman Road to take you up to Chepstow Hill. You continue along the Roman Road to Cat's Ash before entering the woodland area at Kemeys Graig. Follow the trails north east and they will take you into Wentwood Forest where you come to the hill which marks the high point of the forest. The trail then returns to Caerleon on the same paths.",
