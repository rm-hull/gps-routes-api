  "description": "This walk takes you through the National Trust owned Acorn Bank Gardens and into the surrounding countryside to the village of Culgaith in the Eden District of Cumbria. Acorn Bank has stunning gardens with orchards carpeted with wildflowers and surrounded by herbaceous borders. You can also visit the restored 19th century watermill and enjoy a stroll along Crowdundle Beck. The site is located close to Penrith in Cumbria. You can extend your walk by picking up the waterside footpath along the River Eden and heading south towards Temple Sowerby. Also nearby is Whinfell Forest and Cliburn Moss Nature Reserve. The forest and reserve are located just a couple of miles away and provide a good opportunity to extend your walking in the Eden District.",
