  "description": "This walk takes you through the National Trust owned Acorn Bank Gardens and into the surrounding countryside to the village of Culgaith in the Eden District of Cumbria. Acorn Bank has stunning gardens with orchards carpeted with wildflowers and surrounded by herbaceous borders. You can also visit the restored 19th century watermill and enjoy a stroll along Crowdundle Beck. The site is located close to Penrith in Cumbria. You can extend your walk by picking up the waterside footpath along the River Eden and heading south towards Temple Sowerby. Also nearby is Whinfell Forest and Cliburn Moss Nature Reserve. The forest and reserve are located just a couple of miles away and provide a good opportunity to extend your walking in the Eden District.",

      "content": "Just to the south east there's some nice trails in Dufton Ghyll Wood and a more strenuous climb to Dufton Pike. The pike commands fine views over the surrounding area. The climbs to Murton Pike and the wonderful glacial valley at High Cup Nick are also to be found in this area. Just to the west is Lowther Castle where there's 130 acres of gardens and castle terraces. Next to it is also Askham Hall with its colourful terraces and 230ft long double herbaceous border. From the village you can also enjoy a climb to Askham Fell for great views over Ullswater Lake. A few miles to the north east of Penrith you'll find another of the area's top attractions at Hutton in the Forest. The 17th century country house is surrounded by some beautiful landscaped gardens with herbaceous plants, ponds with cascades and some fine topiary. There's also a lovely woodland walk with some fine specimen trees and lots of wildlife. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lake District Walks page."
