  "description": "This Cheshire based village is located near Knutsford and Wilmslow. It's a very pretty place with a 13th century church and historic 17th century timber framed homes. There's also several fine old pubs to visit including the Church Inn where this walk starts. The village is accessible by rail via Mobberley railway station on the Manchester to Chester line. It's located a little way north of the village though. This circular walk from the village visits the Mobberley Nature Reserve where you'll find ponds and nice views of the pretty Pedley Brook. The walk starts in the village at the Church Inn pub where there's a decent sized car park. This 18th century pub is located in a lovely spot  opposite the 13th century St Wilfrid\u2019s Church. From here you head through the village to the countryside where you can pick up footpaths heading south towards the Pedley Brook. You turn east and then north to return to the village on another public footpath. It's a scenic area with views across the fields towards the famous telescope at Jodrell Bank.",
