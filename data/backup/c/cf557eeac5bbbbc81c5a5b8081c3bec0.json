  "description": "This circular walk from the town of Brecon takes you along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and the River Usk. There's nice easy waterside footpaths with fine views of the countryside surrounding the town. The walk starts in Brecon town centre and heads to the canal basin. You can then follow the towpath east for about 2 miles before picking up the riverside path along the Usk. This will lead you back into the town. The long distance Taff Trail runs through Brecon. You could pick it up and head south toward Pen Y Fan. Heading south east will take you to Talybont Reservoir and the Blaen y Glyn Waterfalls. The long distance Usk Valley Walk also passes through the town. The waymarked route is relativley flat as much of it takes place alongside the river or canals.",
