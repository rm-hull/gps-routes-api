  "description": "This circular walk takes you along the River Waveney in the Suffolk town of Bungay. There's a nice riverside path with the option of continuing your walking on the surrounding Outney Common. The trail runs for about 3 miles following the river around the common on flat paths. Along the way there's lovely views over the river to the surrounding Suffolk countryside. You can also pay a visit to Bungay Castle, a ruined Norman structure which is Grade I listed. The route runs parallel to the Bigod Way long distance trail. The 10 mile circular route offers a variety of wildlife, rare plants, many sites of historical interest and fine views of the Waveney Valley countryside. The Angles Way also runs through the area and is a great way of exploring the river valleys and broads of Suffolk and Norfolk.",
