  "description": "This 490 acre park is located in Leigh, Greater Manchester. The main feature is the 170 acre lake which is now a nature reserve with a number of bird hides. Over 200 bird species have been spotted at the park such as Black-faced Bunting, Nightingale, Marsh Harrier, Spoonbill and Leach's Storm-petre. The park has a number of well maintained paths suitable for cyclists or walkers. Facilities include an information centre, mobile cafe and nine hole golf course. The Bridgwater Canal also passes through the park so you can continue your walk/cycle along the towpath if you have time. You could try our Worsley Canal Walk which runs from Worsley in Salford Trail to the park. The Glazebrook Trail long distance footpath also passes the park. You could easily pick it up and head south through the countryside towards Glazebury, Great Woolden Moss and Glazebrook.",

      "content": "One nice idea is to pick up the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and follow it north west to Wigan Flashes Nature reserve where there are more birdwatching opportunities. You could also pick up the Wigan Canal Walk and further explore the area around the town. The canal towpath can be picked up just to the north of the lake. For more walking ideas in the area see the Greater Manchester Walks page."
