  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll around Needham Lake on this short walk in Needham Market. After following the trail around the main lake you can pick up the Gipping Valley River Path and follow the riverside path south to Bosmere and Alderson Lake. It's a very pretty area with wetland areas, meadows and a small woodland. In the summer months you can see lots of wildflowers including pyramidal and bee orchids. You should also see lots of water loving birdlife on the lake. You can park at the car park off Coddenham Road and pick up the nice surfaced trails from here. Needham Market train station is also very close by so you can access the site from there quite easily. To extend your walk you can follow the Gipping River south towards Ipswich and visit Suffolk Water Park.",
