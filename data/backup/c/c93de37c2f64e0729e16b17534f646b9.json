  "description": "This circular walk in the Lake District takes you up Wansfell Pike fell to Troutbeck, and then back through Skelghyll woods. It's popular with walkers as it begins and ends in the accessible town of Ambleside . The first section of the walk takes you from the centre of Ambleside to Stock Ghyll Force , a spectacular 70 foot waterfall which can be viewed safely from a railed viewpoint. You continue the ascent to the peak of Wansfell Pike where there are stunning views of the Coniston Fells, Fairfield, Lake Windermere and\u00a0Red Screes. You descend along Nanny Lane to the village of Troutbeck before country lanes take you on to Townend. This 17th century  stone and slate farmhouse is run by the National Trust and open to the public. Inside you will find intricately carved furniture, a traditional farmhouse kitchen with a real fire and a\u00a0fine collection of books which are of international importance. From Townend you follow Robin Lane to Skelghyll woods before returing to Ambleside. The route is also often started from Troutbeck - see the lovely video on the right for details.",
