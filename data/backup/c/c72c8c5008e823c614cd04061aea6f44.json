  "description": "Follow the lakeside path around this beautiful lake in the Lake District National Park. The circular walk starts at the car park in Loweswater at the south eastern end of the lake (postcode:CA13 0RU). The route includes a woodland stretch through Holme Wood where you can visit the beautiful Holme Force Waterfall. It's just to the west of the path and worth a small detour. The lake is surrounded by a number of fells with Mellbreak, Gavel Fell, Blake Fell, Hen Comb and Burnbank Fell to the south. To the north lies the Fellbarrow range. It's one of the more peaceful spots in the national park with tourists heading for some of the larger nearby lakes. To the east of the lake there's Loweswater Fell where you can enjoy fine views over the area. Both Crummock Water and Buttermere are close by so you could continue your outing by visiting one or both of these lakes. About 2 miles to the south west you will find Cogra Moss. This small reservoir has some lovely woodland trails to follow through the forestry plantations surrounding the water. This route is devised for walkers but cyclists can cycle along the National Cycle Network route on the eastern side of the lake for a delightful waterside ride.",
