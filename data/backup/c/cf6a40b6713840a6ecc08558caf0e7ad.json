This garden is the nearest thing to a Tuscan renaissance garden in the British Isles. The terraces were built around 1680. The valley floor has been, successively, a water garden, a landscape park by William Emes, a kitchen garden and now a National Trust flower garden."

  "description": "Explore the world-class gardens surrounding this historic castle in Welshpool. Powis Castle gardens are regarded as one of the greatest surviving examples of Baroque garden design in Britain. Highlights include the dramatic Italianate terraces, informal woodland, the Edwardian formal garden and superb views of the surrounding countryside - the long mountain and the Breidden Hills are visible on a clear day. Also look out for the 30ft-high yew hedge, ornate dancing statues and stunning herbaceous borders. The original castle dates back to the 13th century but has seen many changes since then. You can go inside and see the fine state rooms and wonderful collections including paintings, tapestries, sculpture and furniture. In the Clive Museum you can see more than 300 items from India and the Far East, dating from the 17th to 19th centuries, from Hindu gods to gold and weapons. Also make time to visit the coach house and stables which are some of the earliest brick buildings in mid-Wales.",
