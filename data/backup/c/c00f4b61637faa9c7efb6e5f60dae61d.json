  "description": "These expansive woods in the Vale of Glamorgan have miles of fine trails to try. You can start the walk from the parking area just to the north of Welsh St Donats. From here you can pick up the trails heading south east to the pretty lake known in Welsh as Pysgodlyn Mawr. It's a lovely tranquil spot with the lake flanked by the attractive woodland. After rounding the lake you return to the car park where there's a picnic site to relax in. You could extend the walk by continuing south east to visit the mill pond at Warren Mill Farm.",

This pleasant route explores the attractive market town with its Physic Garden and pretty riverside park. Also near the woods is the historic town of Llantwit Major. Here you can enjoy a fine coastal walk to the photogenic lighthouse at Nash Point. You can also pick up the Glamorgan Heritage Coast Walk in this area."
