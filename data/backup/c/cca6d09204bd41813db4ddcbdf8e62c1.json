  "description": "This rural village in Berkshire sits just to the west of Streatley, near the border with Oxfordshire. Aldworth is a very pretty with its historic 13th century church and noteworthy Bell Inn Pub. It's a nice place to start a walk with lots of good footpaths to explore the surrounding Berkshire Downs countryside. This walk from the village heads north to pick up The Ridgeway National Trail. You'll then climb to Lowbury Hill where there's some fine views and the site of an ancient Roman Temple. The route then follows The Ridgeway east to visit neighbouring Streatley where you can enjoy a nice riverside walk along the River Thames on the Thames Path .",
