The celebrity station became the bewitching Hogsmeade station in the first Harry Potter film and featured as Aidensfield in the beloved ITV programme Heartbeat. Earlier still, it was used as the setting for Darrowby Station in All Creatures Great and Small. The charming village of Goathland is just a few minutes walk up the bank from the station, with a great range of shops and pubs. You can explore the National Park and the surrounding moorland, embark on an energetic country walk to the Mallyan Spout Waterfall or take the easy path and follow the Rail Trail down the course of the original rope-worked railway to Grosmont. Luckily its\u2019s mostly downhill and there is a pub with a beer garden on the route too. The station also boasts its very own shop and has a tea room which is in a converted 1922 style goods shed."

  "description": "Follow the track bed of the original Whitby-to-Pickering railway line on this short, easy walk in the North York Moors. The trail runs from Grosmont to Goathland passing the waterfalls at Beck Hole on the way. There's some beautiful Yorkshire countryside and a waterside section along the Murk Esk River to enjoy. The path is generally very good for walking on and you also have the option of taking the North York Moors Steam Railway back to Grosmont. You could take a short detour from the path to visit the 70ft high Mallyan Spout Waterfall near Goathland. The falls are the highest in the North York Moors and a real highlight of the area. The Beck Hole Thomason Foss Waterfall is also located in this area. Our Goathland Circular Walk also visits the falls directly from the village centre. It then climbs to the hills above Goathland for wonderful views over the heather moors.",
