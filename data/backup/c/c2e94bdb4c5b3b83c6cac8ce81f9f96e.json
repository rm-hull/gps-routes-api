  "description": "Climb to the 260 m (850 ft) summit of this lovely hill in the Chilterns. Coombe Hill is the highest viewpoint in the Chiltern Hills and commands wonderful views over Aylesbury Vale and the Cotswolds. This circular walk starts in Wendover, near the train station, and follows the Ridgeway long distance trail to the summit. It's a nice, grassy footpath taking you over the delightful Bacombe Hill. There's a series of nice woodland paths and the area is also a nature reserve so look out for pretty wildflowers and over 20 species of butterfly. The summit is a special place with the iconic Coombe Hill Monument. It was erected in 1904 in memory of 148 men from Buckinghamshire who died during the Second Boer War. As well as the great views over the Chilterns AONB you can also see Chequers, the country home of the Prime Minister from the summit. From the summit you descend on more nice woodland paths to Dunsmore and then back into Wendover. You could also visit the hill from the south by climbing from nearby Princes Risborough along the Ridgeway. Our walk starts from the town's train station and visits the attractive nature reserves at Pulpit Hill and Whiteleaf Hill on the way. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Wendover Canal Arm of the Grand Union Canal. It starts in the town and heads to the nearby Weston Turville Reservoir, Tring Reservoirs and Bulbourne. Also of interest is Wendover Woods where there's miles of good walking and cycling trails to be found. In the woods you can also enjoy a climb to the summit of Haddington Hill, the highest point in the Chilterns.",
