  "description": "Enjoy an easy walk around the Hirsel Estate and country park in Coldstream. In the park you will find the lovely Hirsel Lake which is a great place for bird watching. Look out for Herons, Kingfishers, Ducks, Geese and Reed Bunting from the bird hide. The walk also visits the adjacent Dunglass Wood with miles of peaceful waymarked woodland trails. You'll also cross the pretty Leet Water and enjoy views of the surrounding countryside. The estate is not far from the Northumberland village of Ford where you can enjoy a scenic walk to Roughting Linn waterfall.",

      "content": "Just a few miles to the east there's the historically fascinating St Cuthberts Cave. The monks of Lindisfarne reputedly brought St. Cuthbert's body to the site in AD875 following Viking raids on the Island. Near the cave there's also the peaceful woodland trails and steep rock climbing cliffs in the adjacent Kyloe Woods. To the west there's Kelso where you can visit the ruins of Roxburgh Castle, explore the historic abbey and enjoy woodland trails around the picturesque Stichill Linn waterfall. Head north east into Northumberland and you could visit the interesting village of Norham. The historic village is located on the River Tweed next to the Scottish border. There's nice riverside walks and a noteworthy 12th century castle ruin to explore here. For some more local history you could head north to Edin's Hall Broch where you can explore the remains of a 2nd century broch while enjoying some fine views over the area."
