  "description": "This wonderful 17th century mansion in Derbyshire boasts a superb Great Staircase, fine Long Gallery, exquisite plasterwork, wood carvings, classical story-based murals and portraits by John Michael Wright, and of Charles II's mistresses. Also of interest is The Museum of Childhood where you can relive nostalgic memories by exploring the childhoods of times gone by through various interactive displays. You can also step into the shoes of a Victorian pupil in the Victorian schoolroom or become a chimney sweep by taking on the chimney climb. Outside there are beautiful gardens to explore on foot. There are also two star shaped parterres on the top terraces and planted topiary. The hall is located in Ashbourne, Derbyshire - not far from Uttoxeter and Marchington.",
