  "description": "This circular walk visits Kinnitty Castle in the Slieve Bloom Mountains. On the walk you will enjoy views of a striking 19th century Gothic Revival castle and pass close to the Camcor River which runs just to the west of the property. The walk runs for about 4km and includes some small climbs through the woodland of the expansive Kinnitty Forest. You can start off from the parking and picnic area just to the south of the castle, off the R440 Road. Then follow the waymarked paths north west towards the castle that now operates as a hotel. You then loop round to follow alternative paths back to the car park. On the way you will cross various mountain bike trails that run through this part of the forest. The loop uses part of the Slieve Bloom Way an epic circular trail which visits some of the highlights of the area. If you were to follow it east it would take you to the Glenbarrow Clamp Hole Waterfall , a particularly scenic spot in the mountains.",
