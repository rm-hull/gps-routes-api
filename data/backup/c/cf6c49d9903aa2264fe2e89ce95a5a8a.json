  "description": "This walk visits the picturesque village of Greta Bridge in County Durham. The bridge sits in a lovely scenic spot at the confluence of the River Greta with the River Tees. On the walk you will also pass the historic Mortham Tower, a fortified manor house dating from the 14th century, with a 15th-century tower. The route then reaches the Meeting of the Waters where the two rivers join. At this point you can pick up the Teesdale Way long distance footpath and follow the trail west along the river to visit Egglestone Abbey. Here you can explore the fascinating site of the 12th century abbey ruins which are run by English Heritage. The walk continues into the interesting town of Barnard Castle where you can explore the historic castle. The 12th century castle ruins include fine views over the Tees Gorge, a sensory garden of scented plants and remains of the medieval chapel of St Margaret. The walk can be started in Greta Bridge village from the Morritt Arms Hotel with more details below. To continue your walking in the area you could follow the River Greta south east towards Rutherford Bridge via Brignall. See the video below for views of this walk.",

      "content": "The Morrit Arms is a fine place for some post walk refreshment. The inn dates back to the 17th century when the mail coach passed through the village bringing with it a considerable number of visitors. The association of art with The Morritt is demonstrated with a unique mural of Dickensian characters in The Dickens Bar. Dickens visited the area to research Dotheboys School for the novel Nicholas Nickleby. They serve good quality food and have lovely gardens to relax in."
