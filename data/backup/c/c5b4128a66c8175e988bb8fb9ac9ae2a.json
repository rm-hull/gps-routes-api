      "caption": "Galley Head Lighthouse. This photograph was taken in August 2004 during the annual whalewatch event organised on a number of headlands around Ireland by the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group. The Lighthouse stands over 100 metres above the Atlantic ocean and is separated from the mainland by an old Norman wall. The lighthouse was built in 1875 and, in conjunction with its nearest neighbouring lighthouses at Old Head of Kinsale and Fastnet, carries out an important function in guiding shipping along these coasts. It, along with the Fastnet lighthouse, are two of the most powerful lighthouses in Europe.\nThe light from Galley Head lighthouse is unusual in that it also arcs landward because, it is believed, the Sultan of Turkey, who was visiting nearby Castle Freke at Rosscarbery wanted to see the light.\nThere are no public tours of the lighthouse, but it is open during Heritage Week each year in late August."

      "caption": "Although the main buildings were completed in 1875, the site did not become operational until 1878. The original light characteristic consisted of six or seven flashes of white light within sixteen seconds every minute. This was due to the operation of a revolving octagonal optic, combined with a light powered by coal gas burners that were switched on and off every two seconds or so. With a range of 16 nautical miles (30 km; 18 mi) in clear conditions, it was one of the most powerful lights of its time.\nThe two keeper's houses have been returned to their original symmetrical layout and are offered for holiday rental by the Irish Landmark Trust. Sleeping 4\u20136 people in each, they are linked by an internal door, so that larger parties (8\u201312) might be accommodated. Each house has a double and twin bedroom, and a fold-down sofa bed, plus bathroom, kitchen and sitting room. Both houses have adjoining walled lawns. The Galley Head and the Fastnet have the distinction of being two of the most powerful lighthouses in Europe."

  "description": "This fine coastal walk visit the Galley Head Lighthouse near Rosscarbery,\u00a0County Cork. The walk starts from the Long Strand car park where you will find a lovely beach. Just west of here there's also the Wild Atlantic Way Discovery Point at Galley Head where you can enjoy fine views to the headland. From the car park you can walk along the beach and sand dunes towards Kilkeran Lake before following country lanes towards Galley Head Lighthouse. The 19th century lighthouse is now private but you can enjoy some trails along the coast with more amazing views and stunning cliffs. To continue your walking in the area head east along the coast and you could pick up the popular Seven Heads Walk . There's a long circular trail to follow around the picturesque peninsula with pretty seaside villages, lovely beaches and bays.",
