  "description": "Travel from Guisborough to Middlesbrough on this route which links the Teesdale Way and the Cleveland Way. The walk passes through Hutton Low Cross Woods, Pinchinthorpe and Flatts Lane Country Park before the final section takes you through Middlesbrough to the finish point on the River Tees. There's much to enjoy with some lovely North York Moors scenery at the start of the route including great views of the popular Roseberry Topping Hill. You'll also pass the Guisborough Forest and Walkway where there's cycle trails, walking routes, bridleways, a trim trail and an easier sculpture trail.",
