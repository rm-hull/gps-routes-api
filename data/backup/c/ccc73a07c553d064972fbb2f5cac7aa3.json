  "description": "This walk explores the area around the Lancashire village of Sawley, visiting the historic Sawley Abbey and a particularly scenic stretch of the River Ribble. The walk starts at the abbey car park and explores the abbey ruins before picking up a section of the Ribble Way and following it to neighbouring Chatburn. The abbey ruins date back to the 12th century and are now run by English Heritage. You can stroll around the grounds and view a number of information boards detailing the history of the site. The Grade I listed abbey was eventually disolved in in 1536, during the reign of King Henry VIII. After making your way round the ruins head up to Sawley Bridge where you can enjoy some lovely views of the Ribble Valley. To extend the walk continue south along the River Ribble to visit nearby Clitheroe where you can visit the old castle. To the east is Gisburn where there's a fine 18th century coaching inn and nice trails around Gisburn Park.",

      "content": "To continue your walking around the village head south east and enjoy a climb to Pendle Hill. You can also pick up the long distance Pendle Way and enjoy a waterside walk around Black Moss Reservoir in this area. The expansive Gisburn Forest is also not far away. You'll find miles of walking and cycling trails here. Just to the west is the neighbouring village of Waddington. The village is very pretty and a regular winner of the Lancashire Best Kept Village awards. A stroll along the Waddington Brook and through the delightful Coronation gardens is recommended here. To the north is Bolton by Bowland where there's two pretty village greens and views of the Skirden Beck. For more walking ideas in the area see the Ribble Valley Walks page."
