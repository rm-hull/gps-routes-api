  "description": "These two parks are situated right next to each other in the\u00a0London Borough of Barnet . There are some nice footpaths linking the two parks with woodland trails, ponds and lots of wildlife to look out for. You can start your walk from the Scratchwood car park just off the A1 Barnet Way. The London Loop long distance trail will take you through the park's woodland and on into Moat Mount just to the east. Here you'll find open grassland, wild flowers\u00a0and great views over the city from the high points in the park. The Dollis Valley Green Walk passes through the park so you can continue along this trail to extend your walk. If you follow it east it will take you along the Dollis Brook through Barnet. You could also follow the London Loop west and visit the nearby Aldenham Country Park .",
