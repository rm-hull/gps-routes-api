  "description": "This walk from St Mawes explores the Roseland Peninsula visiting the lovely Hidden Hut Cafe in Portscatho. The walk runs for about 5 miles with the option of catching the bus back from Portscatho to St Mawes. Along the way there's lovely coastal paths, beautiful beaches and some splendid countryside to enjoy. You can start the walk from St Mawes Quay where you can catch the Place Ferry over the harbour to Place Creek on the Roseland Peninsula. Here you can pick up the epic South West Coast Path and follow it north to Portscatho and the lovely Porthcurnick Beach where you will find the Hidden Hut. The hut serves a delicious and wide range of meals from an outdoor beach kitchen.",
