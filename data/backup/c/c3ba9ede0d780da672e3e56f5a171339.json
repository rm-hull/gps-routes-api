  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk around this lovely coastal nature reserve near Leiston. Easy walking trails take you through woodland, reed bed, lowland heath, wet grassland and shingle vegetation. The reserve attracts a wide variety of birdlife and is considered one of the best sites in the country for birdwatching. Look out for Avocet, Bittern and Marsh Harriers. Other wildlife in the reserve includes Exmoor Ponies and Konik horses. You may even catch a glimpse of an otter if you are lucky! The Suffolk Coast Path runs past the site so you could pick this up and continue your walk along the coast. If you head north along the path you will soon come to Dunwich Forest and then Westwood Marshes and Walberswick Nature Reserve where there are more excellent birdwatching opportunities. Just to the north you'll find the lovely National Trust owned Dunwich Heath. There's miles of footpaths through beautiful purple heathland and coastal views along the pretty Dunwich beach. Also nearby is the Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve at Walberswick. It's located just north of Minsmere and includes waymarked trails taking you to heathland, reed beds, grassland, woodlands, shingle, lagoons, mudflats and the salt marshes of the Blyth estuary.",

On colder days there's a nice cosy fire indoors, while in the summer there's a nice outdoor area with fruit trees. The pub also does accommodation if you need to stay over. You can find it in the little village on St James's St, with a postoce of IP17 3DT for your sat navs."

      "content": "The circular Westleton Walk passes the reserve. It visits the adjacent Westleton Heath where there's a number of different footpaths and lots of pretty heather in the late summer. A few miles to the south is the town of Leiston where you can explore the fascinating ruins of Leiston Abbey. The English Heritage owned site dates back to the 12th century and is considered one of the historic highlights of the area. Just to the south of Leiston is the neighbouring village of Aldringham where you can explore the RSPB's Aldringham Walks. The wildlife rich conservation area includes a number of footpaths taking you to heathland, woodland and scrub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Walks and the Suffolk Walks pages."
