  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk around this lovely coastal nature reserve near Leiston. Easy walking trails take you through woodland,\u00a0reed bed,\u00a0lowland heath, wet grassland and\u00a0shingle\u00a0vegetation. The reserve attracts a wide variety of birdlife and is considered one of the best sites in the country for birdwatching. Look out for Avocet, Bittern and Marsh Harriers. Other wildlife in the reserve includes Exmoor Ponies and Konik\u00a0horses. You may even catch a glimpse of an otter if you are lucky! The Suffolk Coast Path runs past the site so you could pick this up and continue your walk along the coast. If you head north along the path you will soon come to Dunwich Forest and then Westwood Marshes and Walberswick Nature Reserve where there are more excellent birdwatching opportunities. Just to the north you'll find the lovely National Trust owned Dunwich Heath . There's miles of footpaths through beautiful purple heathland and coastal views along the pretty Dunwich beach. Also nearby is the Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve at Walberswick. It's located just north of Minsmere and includes waymarked trails taking you to heathland, reed beds, grassland, woodlands, shingle, lagoons, mudflats and the salt marshes of the Blyth estuary.",
