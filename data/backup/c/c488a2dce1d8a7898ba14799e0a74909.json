  "description": "This historic West Yorkshire village has some nice local woods to explore on foot. The interesting settlement also includes a 13th century church which is Grade I listed. This circular walk around the village visits Saville Wood, Thunder Bridge and Shelley Wood. The walk starts to the south of the village and heads west to Saville Wood, Boothroyd Wood and Jenkinson Wood. Near here you'll come into the hamlet of Thunder Bridge where there's a noteworthy Grade II listed bridge which spans the Shepley Dike. The route then continues east towards Shelley Hill Top where you turn north towards Healey Greave Wood and Shelley Wood. You then follow Box Ings Lane north back into the village.",
