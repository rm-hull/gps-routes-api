Where the lane vanishes in the distance the Limestone Way turns off right towards Dam Dale and Hay Dale while the Pennine Bridleway continues along the lane to Wheston. This is drystone wall and sheep country - although modern farming practice means that the grassland is much \"improved\" and the natural flora of the native moorland is pretty much gone in this area."

  "description": "Travel through the beautiful Peak District National Park on this walk through Derbyshire and into Staffordshire. The walk starts at Castleton , passing through the scenic Cave Dale and past the remains of Peverill Castle. You continue south through the stunning Monk's Dale and Miller's Dale , where you cross the River Wye. The next stage takes you through Flagg and Monyash where you will pass close to the beautiful Lathkill Dale . It's pretty river, limestone cliffs and waterfalls mean it's worth a small detour to the route. You continue to Youlgreave , where you enter Bradford Dale for a pleasant waterside stretch before heading on to Brassington , Parwich and Tissington. Here you will find the splendid 17th century Tissington Hall and gardens which are well worth a visit. The route also connects with the Tissington Trail here. This popular cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway line. From Tissington you continue through Thorpe, crossing the River Dove and then following it to the finish point at Rocester.",
