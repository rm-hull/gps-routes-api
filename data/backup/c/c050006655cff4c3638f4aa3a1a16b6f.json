  "description": "This is a popular climb to Win Hill in the Derbyshire Peak District. The hill is in a delightful location above Ladybower Reservoir . From the 462 m (1,516 ft) summit there are excellent views of the reservoirs below, the River Derwent, the Hope Valley and the surrounding hills. This loop climbs to the hill summit before descending to Hope Brink and Aston. Start your walk from the Heatherdene  car park at the southern end of Ladbybower Reservoir, just off the A6013. From here you can pick up a footpath heading south along the reservoir before crossing the dam and beginning the steep ascent to Win Hill. This takes you through woodland and along Park Clough to the summit. From here you can enjoy one of the best views in the Peak District with the Upper Derwent Valley, Stanage Edge, the Great Ridge, Mam Tor and Kinder Scout all visible on a clear day. After taking in the views the walk descends to Hope Brink. This area has some good bridleways which are popular with mountain bikers. From here you turn south towards the village of Aston where you follow country lanes back to the reservoir. The route finishes with a short section along the Derwent Valley Heritage Way which leads you back to the car park. The hill is located very close to the villages of Bamford and Thornhill. You could start your walk from either of these places if you prefer. There's lots of good options for extending your walk in this beautiful area. Just to the east you can climb to Bamford Edge where there are great views and lots of interesting gritstone rock formations to look out for. Also nearby is the wonderful gritstone escarpment of Stanage Edge . It's another geologically fascinating place with more wonderful views to enjoy. Part of this walk uses the Derwent Valley Heritage Way long distance trail. You could follow the trail south along the River Derwent to Hathersage . On the western side of the dam you can pick up the Thornhill Trail . The easy cycling and walking trail runs south along disused railway line from the dam to Bamford station.",
