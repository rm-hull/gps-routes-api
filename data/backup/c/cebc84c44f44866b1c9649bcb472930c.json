  "description": "Climb to the 905 m (2,969 ft) summit of this mountain in southern Snowdonia and enjoy breathtaking panoramic views. The mountain is only (31 ft) short of being a member of the Welsh 3000s. The walk starts from the village of Llanuwchllyn near the southern end of Bala Lake. You can park in the village or catch the Bala Lake Railway to Llanuwchllyn and start the walk from there. From the village you head south and pick up the Aran Ridge footpath. You first climb to Aran Benllyn, passing Llyn Lliwbran on the way. You continue to Aran Fawddwy with lovely views down to the lake of Creiglyn Dyfi. It's a challenging climb but with some wonderful views towards the Rhinog mountains, the Berwyns and the rest of the Arans. The walk can also be attempted from Cwm Cywarch. To continue your walking in the area you can try the Bala Lake Walk. Footpaths climb into the hills and forests above the lake with wonderful views over the water and surrounding mountains.",

The early 18th century traditional stone built pub retains historic features including ceiling meat hooks and a fine old stone floor. Outside there's a nice garen area with views of the surrounding mountains and countryside. You can also visit the village's Grade II* listed church in this area."
