  "description": "Climb to the highest point in Cheshire on this wonderful walk in the Goyt Valley. The walk starts from the Erwood Hall Car Park at the southern end of Erwood Reservoir. The route then ascends to Shining Tor, passing the Errwood Estate with its old ruined hall and attractive woodland. The hall was built in the 1830s by Samuel Grimshawe with a 2000 acre estate consisting of farmland and woodland with azaleas and rhododendrons. You can see the Grimshawe's family cemetery and an attractive Spanish Shrine to the governess of the children at Errwood Hall.  The estate is a popular start point for walks in the Goyt Valley. At the 559 m (1,834 ft) summit of Shining Tor you can enjoy great views of the Cheshire Plain,  Winter Hill, the city of Manchester and Jodrell Bank. On a clear day you can also see as far as Snowdonia. The route then heads north along the ridge to Cats Tor and then on to Pym Chair. It's a lovely stretch of the walk with a good path leading along the ridge with views of Cats Tor and the surrounding Peak District hills and moorland. Pym Chair is another popular viewpoint with a car park. You could also start the walk from here if you prefer. From Pym chair you descend back to Errwood Reservoir along a nice country lane before a final waterside section leads you back to the Errwood Hall car park. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Midshires Way which runs past the reservoir. You could actually start the walk from nearby Buxton and follow the Midshires Way to Shining Tor from there. The Errwood Reservoir and Fernilee Reservoir Walk also starts from the same location. If you head north from Pym Chair then you would soon come to Windgather Rocks, a popular place for rock climbers.",
