  "description": "This hill top Bucks village is in a great location for sweeping views and country walks. This walk from the village visits the famous windmill before heading to the nearby Rushbeds Nature Reserve and the neighbouring village of Ludgershall. The walk starts in the village centre and heads north west to visit the windmill. This 17th century mill is one of the earliest and best preserved examples of a post mill in the country. There's also some excellent views over the surrounding countryside from the elevated position of the mill. The area includes Brill Common which is characterised by a number of unusual bumps and grassy mounds. After exploring the windmill site you continue north along a footpath to meet with a country lane. Turn east and you can follow the quiet lane to where it meets with the Bernwood Jubilee Way. This waymarked trail will then take you north east to the Rushbeds Nature Reserve where there are some peaceful woodland trails. There's also lots of woodland birds and different types of butterfly to see in the summer months. The trail then continues north through the countryside to Ludgershall. Here you can enjoy refreshments before returning to Brill on the same paths. You can turn it into a circular walk by heading west to Piddington and then turning south to climb Muswell Hill for wonderful views over the area.",
