The gardens are also delightful with herbaceous plants, ponds with cascades and some fine topiary. The woodland walk will take you to rhododendrons and magnificent American conifers, planted as a small arboretum in the 1860s. Look out for a variety of wildlife including red squirrel, roe deer and many species of bird on the trail.",
