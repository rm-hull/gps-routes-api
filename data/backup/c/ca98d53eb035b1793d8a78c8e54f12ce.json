  "description": "The town of East Grinstead is located in the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex. It's nicely situated on the edge of the High Weald AONB where there are great opportunities for walking. It's also located close to a number of historic houses and a splendid reservoir and nature reserve. This circular walk from the town uses the High Weald Landscape Trail , the Sussex Border Path and the Forest Way to visit the nearby Weir Wood Reservoir . The route runs for about 7 miles with countryside, woodland and waterside footpaths to enjoy on the way. There's also a visit to the National Trust's lovely Standen House . The walk starts at the train station and heads through the town along the High Weald Landscape Trail. You then head south through the countryside to Dunning's Wood before coming to Standen House. The house dates from the 19th century and includes gardens, parkland and bluebell woodland. Shortly after leaving the house you'll come to the expansive Weir Wood Reservoir. The western end of the 280 acre reservoir is a protected nature reserve and bird sanctuary. You can follow the Sussex Border Path east along the water before heading north east to meet up with the Forest Way. This shared cycling and walking path will take you north west back into the town centre.",
