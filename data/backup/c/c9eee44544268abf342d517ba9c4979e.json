  "description": "This walk explores the attractive village of Spiddal on the shore of\u00a0Galway Bay\u00a0in\u00a0County Galway. You can enjoy a stroll around the picturesque harbour before heading east to visit the beach. It's a very pretty area with lots of little cottages, fine coastal views and an interesting old church to see. You can continue your walking in the area by heading east to try the riverside walk in Galway . The peaceful woodland trails in Barna Woods are also nearby."
