Looking down the whole length of the lake from the small spit at the eastern end. \u00a0Branston Water Park is situated between the Trent and Mersey Canal and the A38 road just SW of Burton. The area was first quarried for aggregates during the 1930's. The quarry was then functional up until the 1950's when it started to become too costly to continue pumping out the water, since then the quarry has gradually filled up with a natural supply of water as the water table has gradually risen up to today's present level."

The clubs at present that use the water are the model boat club, fishermen and wind surfers"
