  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk across Cam Long Down to Cam Peak on this lovely walk in Dursley. The down is on a splendid section of the Cotswold Escarpment with marvellous views, wildflower rich limestone grassland and attractive woodland. You can start the walk from the centre of Dursley and follow the Cotswold Way across the down. It climbs from the town to Cam Peak, reaching a height of over 700ft at the high points. From here there are really lovely views over the River Severn to the Forest of Dean , May Hill and the Welsh mountains. The route takes you over Cam Long Down with the option of continuing a little further east and visiting Uley Bury . This long, flat-topped hill is an impressive multi-vallate, scarp-edge Iron Age hill fort dating from around 300 BC. If you would prefer a shorter walk then you can start from the car park on the down. It's easy to extend your walk by continuing along the Cotswold Way . If you follow it north east you can visit Coaley Peak for more great views. Also nearby is the expansive Woodchester Park which includes a series of lakes and woodland trails.",
