  "description": "These woods near Stockton on Tees have 2 waymarked walking trails for you to try. There's attractive broadleaved and conifer woodland, meadows and ponds to see on the site. It's also a nice place for wildlife spotting with owls, deer and foxes to look out for. You can park at the car park just off Longnewton Lane to start your walk. You could also start from Longnewton village if you prefer. It's easy to extend your walking by heading towards Eaglescliffe and picking up the Teesdale Way. There's a nice riverside footpath along the River Tees to pick up here. To continue your woodland walking in the Stockton area, head north to visit Wynyard Woodland Park, Billingham Beck Valley Country Park and Cowpen Bewley Woodland Park. There's more nice trails to try here with lakes and birdlife to see at Cowpen Bewley. For a nice riverside walk try the Tees Barrage Walk along the River Tees in Stockton. There's two nice riverside nature reserves to visit here.",
