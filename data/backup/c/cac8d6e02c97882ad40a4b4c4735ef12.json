  "description": "This walk visits the Cliburn Moss Nature Reserve before following woodland trails into the adjacent Whinfell Forest. Much of the area is taken up by the Center Parcs but there are public footpaths through the forest as well. You can park at the Cliburn Moss car park and explore the reserve first. It has some nice waymarked footpaths taking you to fen, bog, heath and woods. Look out for wildlife including red squirrels, blackcaps and willow warblers. After exploring the reserve you can head north and skirt around the edge of the holiday village in Whinfell Forest. The woods are located a few miles south east of Penrith. You can follow National Cycle Network Route 71 from Penrith to the woods. To extend your walking in the area you could visit the National Trust owned Acorn Bank. Here you can explore stunning gardens and visit the restored 19th century watermill. Also nearby is Lowther Castle with its 130 acres of parkland and the splendid Lakeland Bird of Prey Centre.",
