  "description": "This Quantocks village is in a superb location for starting a walk to the surrounding hills. There's also a very fine 16th century pub for post walk refreshment. This circular walk from the village takes in three of the popular peaks in the area. You'll climb to Wills Neck before heading to the neighbouring Lydeard Hill and Cothelstone Hill. The route uses sections of the waymarked Macmillan Way and the Samaritans Way South West to visit the three Quantocks peaks. You'll also pass Triscombe Quarry, Marrow Hill and Bagborough Hill as you make your way through the area surrounding the village.",

The pub has some history, dating all the way back to 1573 when it was originally called The Shepherd\u2019s Crook. It's a charming place with a quirky original front door, original beams and more than 80 tons of solid oak timbers which give the pub a special feel.
