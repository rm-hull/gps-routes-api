  "description": "Enjoy a walk across Abinger and Wotton Commons before a climb to Leith Hill on this circular walk in the Mole Valley. There's miles of nice woodland trails, ponds, streams and great views from the many viewpoints on the expansive common. It's quite a challenging walk with several hill climbs so a good level of fitness is required. The walk starts at the Friday Street car park close to the pretty Mill Pond. From here you can pick up the trails heading south across Abinger Bottom to Wotton Common. You then climb to the highest point in the South East on Leith Hill where you will find an 18th century Gothic tower, with panoramic views northwards to London and south to the English Channel. After taking in the views the route descends to Duke's Warren and Whiteberry Hill, before crossing Broadmoor and returning to the car park. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the Stephan Langton Inn on Friday Street. The country pub is located just south of the mill pond and serves Modern British cuisine and craft ales. The Greensand Way long distance trail runs through the southern end of the common so you can pick this up to extend your walking in the area. Heading west will take you to Hurt Wood and Winterfold Forest in Peaslake. Here you'll find miles of great mountain bike trails and footpaths. Also nearby is the climb to Holmbury Hill where there are more wonderful views over the Surrey Hills to enjoy. The sister site of Abinger Roughs is located about a mile or so to the north west. There's nice woodland trails with lots of gorgeous rhododendrons in the spring months.",
