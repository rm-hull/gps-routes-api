  "description": "This tranquil reservoir near Peebles in the Pentland Hills is a lovely place for a quiet stroll. There's a nice trail to follow along the eastern side of the water with fine views to the surrounding hills and countryside. You could start the walk from Eddleston where there's plenty of parking. The walk can be extended by heading south from the loch and climbing up to the Northshield Rings Fort for fine views over the area. There's also some nice woodland trails in the surrounding woodland of Fala Steel to the east.",

To the south there's Megget Reservoir, Talla Reservoir, Camps Reservoir and St Mary's Loch in the Scottish Borders. Head north towards Temple and there's a nice circular walk around Edgelaw Reservoir. Rosebery Reservoir is also located in this area. In Peebles you can pick up the Tweed Valley Railway Path and enjoy a walk or cycle along this multi user path. The Cross Borders Drove Road passes through Peebles too. It runs north to Harperrig Reservoir in the Pentland Hills or south to Hawick. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pentland Hills Walks page."
