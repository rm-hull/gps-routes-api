Although these watercourses are known as \"Ditches\" they are large enough in terms of width and depth to be bigger than many so-called rivers. Eagle-eyed viewers will spot the heron, and the faint wisp of steam coming off the surface of Roundmoor Ditch caused by the air temperature being much lower than the water temperature."

  "description": "This Berkshire based town is a fine place to start a walk with two rivers, a local lake and the iconic Eton College to explore. This riverside circular walk from the village visits Eton Wick, the River Thames Path , Dorney Lake , the Jubilee River and the famous Eton College. The college dates back to the 15th century when it was founded by Henry VI. Eton is one of the most prestigious institutions in the world due to its history, wealth, and\u00a0notable alumni. The walk start from the riverside train station where you can pick up the Thames Path National Trail and follow it west along the river to Eton Wick. The route continues west along the Boveney Ditch and the Cree Brook on Dorney Common before turning north west along Dorney Lake. The lake was used as the rowing venue for the 2012 Olympics in London. You continue through Dorney, passing Dorney Court before picking up the Jubilee River Path. Follow this east past Chalvey on the outskirts of Slough before coming to Agars Plough. You can turn south west along the school playing fields before passing the historic Eton College and returning to the train station.",
