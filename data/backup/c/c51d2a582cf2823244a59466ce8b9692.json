  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the Peak District village of Chelmorton near Buxton in the White Peak. The interesting village includes typical limestone walls, an 18th century pub, an 11th century church and the Illy Will Water stream running through the settlement. The route uses several of the local long distance trails to visit Deep Dale, Wye Dales and Chee Dale in the Derbyshire Dales. There's some wonderful limestone scenery, deep gorges, riverside trails and fine views of the surrounding Peak District scenery from the high points. The walk starts in the village and picks up the Midshires Way which you can follow north west to Deep Dale. Head north through the dale and it will lead you to Wye Dale where you can follow paths along the River Wye. Here you can pick up the Monsal Trail and head east to Chee Dale. Near Miller's Dale the route turns south along the Limestone Way , passing Sough Top and Taddington Moor before returning to Chelmorton.",
