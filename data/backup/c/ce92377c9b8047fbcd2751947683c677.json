  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk around the beautiful park and gardens surrounding this manor house in Kendal. The walk includes a lovely waterside section along the River Kent and through the medieval deer park where Black Fallow Deer and a herd of rare breed Bagot Goats roam the area. The park also includes a stunning topiary garden. With over 100 pieces of living sculpture it is considered the finest and oldest topiary garden in the world. Some of the trees and bushes are over 300 years old with the garden layout relatively unchanged since it was planted in the late 17th century. Sculptures include Chess pieces, the Judges Wig, the Howard Lion, the Great Umbrellas, Queen Elizabeth and her Maids of Honour, a Jug of Morocco Ale and four Peacocks. Also make time to visit the rose gardens, 17th century garden and the fragrant herb garden. If you have time you could visit the nearby Sizergh Castle. It is less than two miles away from Levens Hall and has 1,600-acres of limestone pasture, orchards and peaceful woodland in Brigsteer Woods. The Cumbria Coastal Way also runs past Levens Hall so you could also continue your walk along the River Kent.",
