Willance's horse was killed by the fall, but he survived with two broken legs. To keep alive until help arrived, he cut open the horse's body and crawled inside. This saved his life, but he lost a leg. The leg was buried in the churchyard where the rest of Willance was buried nine years later."

  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk from Richmond to the pretty village of Marske, a few miles west of the town. The route runs for just over 7 miles with some moderate climbs on the way. It visits Whitcliffe Scar and Whitcliffe Woods with a nice riverside section along the River Swale. From the high points there are fine views over the surrounding Yorkshire Dales countryside. The walk starts in the town and heads north west past Hurgill to Whitecliffe Wood and Applegarth Scar before turning south west to Marske. On the way you'll pass Whitecliff Scar where you can climb to the Willance's Leap where there's a monument to Robert Willance who plunged over the cliff and survived during the 17th century. There's excellent views over Swaledale from the elevated position of the scar. In Marske there are lots of pretty cottages, an old church and the 13th century Marske Hall to see. After exploring Marske you retrace your steps to Applegarth where you turn south east to pick up trails along the River Swale. You'll pass Lownethwaite Farm and the Caravan Park before returning to Richmond.",
