There's some pretty locks and the picturesque Drungewick Aqueduct to admire here. The walk continues towards Pulborough before passing through the delightful Amberley Wild Brooks wetland with its variety of interesting wildlife. The route then comes to an end near Amberley in Sussex. Much of the walk follows canal side towpaths with footpaths and minor roads making up the remaining sections.
