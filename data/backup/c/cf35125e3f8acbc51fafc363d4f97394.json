  "description": "This circular walk takes you around these two beautiful lakes in Snowdonia. There's some stunning scenery in this National Trust owned area which lies at the northern slopes of Cadair Idris. You can start the walk at the car park at the western end of the northern lake. It's located about a mile to the south east of the little village of Arthog, on the Mawddach Estuary. From the car park you can pick up trails heading round the lakes before returning on some quiet country lanes. The scenery is stunning with the two lakes backed by Pared Y Cefn Hir hill and other mountains. After your walk you can head to the Cadair Idris Visitor Centre to enjoy refreshments at the tea room. Located near the car park the centre includes a wealth of information and an exhibition detailing the wildlife and geology of this fascinating area. Just to the west of the lakes you can continue your walking along the Arthog Waterfalls. There's a nice footpath running through woodland towards the village and the lovely Mawddach Estuary. Here you can pick up the popular Mawddach Trail and visit nearby Barmouth.",
