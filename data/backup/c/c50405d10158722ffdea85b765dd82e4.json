  "description": "This circular walk from Guildford visits the 17th century Chilworth manor. It's about a 3 mile walk from the town to the house. This walk continues to Blackheath Common and Shalford before returning to Guildford along the River Wey. The walk starts on the River Wey Navigation in Guidlford and heads south along the water to Shalford Park. Here you can pick up the North Downs Way and follow it east to St Martha's Hill. The hill summit stands at 574 feet (175 m) and commands wonderful views over the Surrey Hills. There are also a number of nice woodland trails, attractive grassland and a number of interesting plants. From the hill it is a short descent to Chilworth Manor which is grade II listed by Historic England. The house is surrounded by lovely gardens which include a fine terraced walled garden, topiary, herbaceous borders, sculptures, mature trees and stew ponds that date back a 1000 years. From the house it is a short walk south west to the village of Chilworth. The village is in an attractive location occupying both sides of the River Tillingbourne between outcrops of the Greensand Ridge. There's a nice gastro-pub in the village where you can stop for refreshments at what is roughly the half way point of the walk. After passing the manor the walk continues to Blackheath Common. The 250 common is covered with footpaths taking you to lowland heathland, woodland and acid grassland. From the common you follow the Downs Link west towards Shalford. Here you pick up a lovely waterside footpath along the River Wey to take you back into Guildford. For more walking ideas in the area see our Guildford Walks page.",
