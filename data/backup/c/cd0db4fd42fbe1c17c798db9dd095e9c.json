  "description": "This circular walk from the popular village of Grasmere visits several Lake District highlights. You'll visit Grasmere Lake, Rydal Water, Rydal Hall and Wordsworth's Dove Cottage on this walk which runs for just over 5 miles. The walk starts in the centre of Grasmere where you can visit the grave of poet William Wordsworth who is buried in the churchyard of St. Oswald's Church. Right next to the church is the famous Grasmere Gingerbread Shop where you can expect a long queue in the holiday months! From the church you can follow Red Bank Country Lane past the Garden Centre to the lake. The lane bends round the western side of the lake, passing the lakeside Faeryland tea rooms where you can also hire little boats to take out on the lake. Eventually you will come to a footpath heading down to the lake on your left. You can then follow a lovely lakeside path or climb up to Loughrigg Terrace for great views down to the lake. There's also the option here to head south and climb to Loughrigg Fell for wide ranging views of the nearby lakes and fells. At the eastern end of the lake there is a nice little beach where you will often see people relaxing on a summer's day. The route continues east towards Rydal Water where you can drop down to the lakeside path. At the eastern end of the water you pass through woodland before crossing the River Rothay to take you up to Rydal Hall. The\u00a0Grade II listed\u00a0house is well worth exploring. There's lovely formal gardens with a fountain, a nice cafe next to Rydal Beck and a waterfall with a viewing platform. It's a good spot to stop for refreshments with outdoor seating next to the beck. From Rydal Hall you pick up a section of the Coffin Route . The old path runs from Ambleside to Grasmere and is so called because it was used to convey coffins on their final journey to St Oswalds Church in Grasmere. You follow it west past Nab Scar to Town End where you will find Dove Cottage, the home of poet William Wordsworth from 1799 to 1808. \u00a0During this period, William wrote much of the poetry for which he is remembered today, including 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud'. You can explore the fascinating old house and then browse the adjacent museum where you will find exhibits, manuscripts, landscapes and portraits. The final section of the walk takes you back to the village, passing a series of pretty shops and galleries on the way.",
