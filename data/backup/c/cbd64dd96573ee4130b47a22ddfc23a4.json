  "description": "This lovely coastal walk takes you along the beautiful Chichester Harbour from Bosham to West Wittering. The route takes you over the Itchenor Ferry which runs seasonally between April and the end of October. It's a 5 mile walk to West Wittering so 10 miles there and back. Highlights on the walk include the wide variety of wildfowl and warders you can see in Chichester Harbour. Also take time to visit The Holy Trinity Church in Bosham at the start of the walk. The noteworthy church has been in existence at least since Anglo-Saxon times, and is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The walk starts at Bosham Quay and follows paths south along the Bosham Channel to the Itchenor Ferry. It's a lovely stretch of coast, with views over the channel to to Cobnor and Chidham. The short ferry crossing is very pleasant and will take you over to the yachting village of Itchenor. The village sits on the Manhood Peninsula, and includes a nice pub called the Ship Inn. It's a good place to stop for refreshments with a decent menu and beer garden to relax in. The walk continues south along the coast, passing Chaldock Point and Rookswood House, with nice views across the Chichester Channel. You finish at West Wittering but you could extend the walk by exploring East Head. Here you can stroll through shingle, sandy beach and a delightful sand dune habitat. The area is great for wildlife with skylarks, ringed plover and common seals to look out for. From the village you can also enjoy fine views across Chichester Harbour to Hayling Island. The second part of this walk follows the New Lipchis Way long distance footpath. You can extend your walking in the area by following the trail east from Itchenor to Chichester, via Donnington.",
