  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Stichill Linn Waterfall in the Scottish Borders near Kelso . The falls are located just to the south west of the village of Stichill on the Eden Water. They are something of a hidden gem so it's a delightfully peaceful spot for a stroll. You can start the circular walk from the country lane Harrietfield. Then follow trails north west past Newton Don and Home Farm to the river and the falls. Some of the trails are marked private but are accessible to the public under the terms of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.",
