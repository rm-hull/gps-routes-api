  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Stichill Linn Waterfall in the Scottish Borders near Kelso. The falls are located just to the south west of the village of Stichill on the Eden Water. They are something of a hidden gem so it's a delightfully peaceful spot for a stroll. You can start the circular walk from the country lane Harrietfield. Then follow trails north west past Newton Don and Home Farm to the river and the falls. Some of the trails are marked private but are accessible to the public under the terms of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.",

      "content": "The Borders Abbeys Way runs just past the site. You could pick this up to visit Kelso Abbey and enjoy a walk along the river Tweed and Teviot. The path can be followed west to visit the Eildon Hills near Melrose. Heading south will take you to Jedburgh where you can explore the 12th century abbey ruins and enjoy a stroll alond the Jed Water river. Just to the east of Melrose there's the climb to Scott's View to try. The viewpoint is named after Sir Walter Scott, author of novels such as Ivanhoe and Rob Roy. From here you can enjoy some wonderful views over the town and the surrounding hills and countryside."
