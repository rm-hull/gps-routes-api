  "description": "This fortified manor house near Blackburn and has some nice trails to follow around its grounds and through the surrounding area. The house dates from the 16th century and takes its name from the de Hoghton family, its historical owners since at least the 12th century. This circular walk from the tower visits the grounds before picking up the Witton Weavers Way to explore the surrounding area. The walk starts from the car park at the tower. You could also start from the nearby Pleasington train station if you would like to come by public transport. You can catch trains there from Preston or Blackburn. From the car park you can pick up surfaced footpaths heading around the grounds of the castle. The house sits in an elevated position so there are fine views of the surrounding Lancashire countryside to enjoy on the way. The grounds includes woodland, a walled garden, a rose garden and the Grade I listed Barn which dates to 1692. After exploring the grounds you can head east to pick up the Witton Weavers Way. This waymarked trail will take you to Hoghton Bottoms and the village of Pleasington. Here you could take a small detour from the route and head east into Witton Country Park. There's a visitor centre, river trails and a climb to Billinge Hill to try here. This route heads south through Pleasington to Feniscowles where you head west to meet up with the Witton Weavers Way again. The trail then follows the River Darwen back towards the castle.",

      "content": "There is a popular monthly farmer's market at the hall where you can pick up some delicious Lancashire produce. See the tower website for dates and details. To extend your walking from the tower continue along the Witton Weavers Way to visit the pretty Belmont Reservoir where there are some waterside walking trails. If you were to head south along the trail there are a few local walking highlights around Tockholes. You could enjoy a lakeside stroll along Roddlesworth Reservoir and then a climb to the splendid viewpoint at Darwen Tower or Great Hill. For more walking ideas in the area see the Lancashire Walks page."
