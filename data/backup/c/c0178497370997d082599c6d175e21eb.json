  "description": "This walk visits Abbey Craig hill in Stirling , home to the National Wallace Monument which commemorates Sir William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish Knight. The tower stands on the volcanic crag of Abbey Craig where Wallace is said to have watched the army of King Edward I of England, prior to the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The walk starts at the visitor centre car park and follows good woodland footpaths to the monument where there are wonderful views over Stirling and the River Forth to the Highland Mountains. For a fee you can climb to the top of the monument itself and enjoy even better views. After visiting the monument it's easy to extend your walk into the surrounding woodland on one of the colour coded trails. Just to the north there's the University of Stirling where there are some pleasant grounds to explore. The climb to Dumyat also starts from here.",
