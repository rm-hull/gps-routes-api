  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk to Colmers Hill and enjoy wonderful views over the Dorset countryside and coast. The hill is located just to the west to the town of Bridport, providing great views over the town. The hill is a distinctive landmark of the area with its conical shape, topped by pine trees. Start the walk from the little village of Symondsbury where footpaths will take you up to the hill top. It's quite a steep climb but you are rewarded with splendid views of rolling hills and the Jurassic Coast. In the springtime you may also see bluebells around the summit. After taking in the views the route continues west toward Quarry Cross. Here you pick up Shute's Lane to descend back to the village. Here you can enjoy refreshments at the excellent Symondsbury Kitchen, where there is a lovely garden to sit out in. To extend your walking in the area head south to the Jurassic Coast where you can pick up the West Bay to Seatown Walk. The Monarch's Way also passes just to the north of the hill. You could pick it up and head east into Bridport or start the walk from the town and use the trail to reach the area near to the hill.",
