  "description": "This small Cotswolds village is located near Moreton-in-Marsh and Blockley in Gloucestershire. The hillside village includes several historic buildings including a 17th century cottage and a noteworthy church dating back to the 12th century. The village lies on the Heart of England Way providing an opportunity to explore the area on a good waymarked footpath. This circular walk from the village uses the trail and a section of the Monarch's Way to visit Sezincote House, Longborough, Moreton-in-Marsh and Batsford Arboretum. Sezincote is located just south of the village and is a major highlight of the area. Here you will find a splendid Mogul Indian palace surrounded by stunning gardens with a curving orangery, spring-fed pools, canals and a large lake. At Batsford just north of the settlement, you will find a glorious arboretum and botanical garden with Japanese maples, magnolias and pines.",
