Prior to a bridge the original crossing was further to the south at Stocks Ferry until a bridge was added when the river was straightened sometime between 1790 and 1810. This bridge was replaced by the swing bridge in the 1880s to allow navigation up to Asham Wharf and Lewes. The bridge is well used by walkers carrying the South Downs Way across the Ouse valley as well as connecting with footpaths on either side of the river between Newhaven and Lewes."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Southease To Lewes along a riverside path before returning via the villages of Kingston near Lewes and Rodmell. The walk starts from the little village of Southease which has a railway station on on the Seaford branch of the East Coastway Line. As such if you would like to just do the first part of the walk along the River to Lewes you could catch the train back. This section of the walk is about 4 miles. From Southease you can pick up the Sussex Ouse Valley Way and follow the waymarked footpath north along the river Ouse to Lewes. On the way you will pass the Railway Land Nature Reserve where you can look out for a variety of wildlife. The route then takes you through Lewes where you could visit the 11th century castle and associated museum. You continue south west to the village of Kingston near Lewes before picking up The South Downs Way National Trail. This will take you across Iford Hill where there are some splendid views over the area. The route continues to the village of Rodmell where you could pay a visit to the National Trust's Monk's House. The 16th-century weatherboarded cottage was once the home of author Virginia Woolfe and her husband, the political activist, journalist and editor Leonard Woolf. Here they received many visitors from the famous Bloomsbury Group, including T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, and Roger Fry. From Rodmell it is a short walk back to Southease where the walk finishes.",
