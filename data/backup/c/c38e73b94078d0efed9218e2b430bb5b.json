  "description": "This lovely circular walk explores the beautiful National Trust owned area of Alderley Edge. Starting at Alderley Edge train station you climb to a sandstone escarpment, where there are fabulous over the Cheshire Plain to the Peak District. You return through a delightful wooded area, passing a waterfall, before arriving back at Alderley Edge train station. The National Trust have also devised a number of other walking trails which you can pick up from the Wizard Tea-Room. These include the Miners Ramble which explores the age-old mining history of the Edge. The Wizard Trail also starts from the edge and will take you to the the Wizard's well, the 15th century Alderley mill and National Trust owned Hare Hill. You can follow a permissive path south to Hare Hill to extend the walk. It's about a 1.5 mile walk south east from the edge and includes beautiful gardens with 70 varieties of rhododendron, azaleas, hollies, and hostas. The centrepiece is a walled garden containing a pergola and wire sculptures.",
