He was the first Bishop of Johannesburg in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa and the Church of England. For a short period at the start of the 20th century he was, as a young man, Rector of Woolpit. His successor as Bishop of Johannesburg was Desmond Tutu. A footpath runs across this land, acting as a short-cut between Broomhill Lane and Beyton Road."
