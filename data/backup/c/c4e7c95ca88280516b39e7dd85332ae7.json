  "description": "Enjoy a climb up Wellington Hill and visit the monument created to commemorate the Duke of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo. The noteworthy site is one of the main features of the Blackdown Hills AONB in Somerset. There's great views from the hill summit and a number of woodland trails to enjoy too. Start your walk from the Wellington Monument car park, at Hemyock Place. From here you can pick up a lovely, beech lined woodland trail up to the monument. The obelisk stands at a height of 175 ft (53 m) and is one of the tallest of its kind in Britain. It's surrounded by an attractive area of grassland where you can see various wildflowers in the summer months. There's also a wide variety of birds and butterflies to look out for here too. Wellington Hill is located just to the east of Culmstock Beacon and Black Down Common. You can extend your walk by heading up to the beacon for more great views over the Somerset and Devon countryside. The monument lies just to the south of the market town of Wellington where there are two waymarked walks to pick up. You could also visit the hill from the town by following a public footpath south for just over a mile.",
