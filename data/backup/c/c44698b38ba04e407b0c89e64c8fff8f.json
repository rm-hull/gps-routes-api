  "description": "This circular ride/walk takes you along the River Tamar and then the River Tavy with splendid views of the beautiful Tamar Valley AONB. You start at Bere Ferrers and head north along the River Tamar to Bere Alston before the route returns to its origin along the River Tavy. You will also pass near to the beautiful Lopwell Dam which is worth the small detour as you return. The nature reserve consists of a variety of different habitats including mudflats, freshwater marsh, wildflower meadow, scrub-grassland, saltmarsh and semi-natural woodland. The ride is easy to access from Bere Ferrers railway. It includes a few steep climbs but with terrific views at the high points. Much of the route follows the Tamar Valley Discovery Trail so is also suitable for walkers.",

      "content": "The Tamar Valley Line has a train station at Bere Ferrers. It's is a great way of seeing the area from a different perspective. The scenic railway takes you through rolling green, sleepy villages and beautiful river crossings. The highlight of the journey is when the train slowly creeps down over the impressive Calstock viaduct and you are 120 feet high looking down on the river below."
