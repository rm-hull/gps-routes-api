  "description": "The riverside town of Marlow is a lovely spot for walking. With the Thames path and some lovely countryside and woodland there's lots of good options for walkers. This is a popular 4.5 mile walk from the town to the nearby village of Cookham. It's a particular lovely stretch of the Thames Path with the option of continuing onto Maidenhead if you have time. You can also turn it into a circular walk by heading north west past the golf course in Cookham to Coney Copse. Other public footpaths will then take you towards Quarry Wood and Marlow. At Cookham you also have the option of linking with the Beeches Way and following the path east to the splendid Burnham Beeches Nature Reserve . Our circular walk around the village takes you along the river before rounding Cock Marsh and the golf course. Around Cookham you can also cross the river and visit the National Trust owned Cliveden House or pay a visit to the pretty village of Bourne End .",
