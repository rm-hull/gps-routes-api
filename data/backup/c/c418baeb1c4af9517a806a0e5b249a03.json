  "description": "This Staffordshire bases village sits close to the town of Burton Upon Trent and the Rivers Trent and Swarbourn. This long circular walk uses sections of the National Forest Way and The Way for the Millennium to explore the Needwood Forest area of the National Forest. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the National Forest Way, a waymarked long distance footpath. The route leads you north to Woodmill and Brakenhurst Wood where there's some pleasant woodland trails. You then head east through Newchurch to Byrkley Park where you will pass the St George's Park National Football Centre. The centre is the base for all coaching and development work undertaken by the FA (Football Association). You continue east to Rangemore and Tatenhill before turning south east to visit Branston Water Park. The park has some pleasant footpaths taking you around a series of lakes with lots of wildlife to see. The route then heads south along the Trent and Mersey Canal to Barton-under-Needwood where there's a pretty boating marina. You continue south to the picturesque Alrewas and Fradley Junction where you could take a small detour from the route to visit the National Memorial Arboretum and Croxall Lakes. From Alrewas you follow The Way for the Millennium north west along the River Swarbourn to return you to Wroxall.",

The centre provides a wealth of information on the area and also has on site bike hire. The surrounding parkland is well worth exploring too with woodland trails, meadows, ponds, lots of butterflies and some interesting sculptures to see. The Woodland Trust's Badger Wood can also be accessed in this area."
