  "description": "This walk visits Wickersley Woods in South Yorkshire near Rotherham. The small wood is located on the southern side of the village. There's some nice easy trails with some attractive wood carvings to see on the way. The woods are popular with local dog walkers. The Rotherham Round Walk runs just to the west of the woods. You could pick up this long distance waymarked footpath to further explore the area. Head west would take you towards Rymarsh and Rotherham.",
