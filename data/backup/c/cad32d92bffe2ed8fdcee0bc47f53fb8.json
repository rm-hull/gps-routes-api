  "description": "This circular walk on the Devon Coast explores the woodland trails of Brownsham Wood before heading to the secluded Mouth Mill beach where you can see the impressive Blackchurch Rock. You'll then head along the coast to visit Brownsham Cliff and the Windbury Hillfort on the South West Coast Path. The walk starts/finishes at the National Trust car park at Brownsham, located on the western side of the woods. On the varied walk there's peaceful woodland trails and some beautiful coastline to enjoy. You can extend the walk by heading south east to neighbouring Clovelly. The pretty village is well worth a visit and is also the start/finish point for the Buck Mills to Clovelly Walk. For views of an extended circular walk to Clovelly from the wood, see the video below. To the west there's the lovely Hartland Point and Hartland Quay to explore.",

It's also historically significant with a thousand year old church, a 14th century farm and the noteworthy Hawker's Hut. This unusual structure sits in a photogenic spot and was built using driftwood by local vicar and poet Rev. Robert Stephen Hawker."
