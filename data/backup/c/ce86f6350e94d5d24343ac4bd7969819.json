  "description": "Climb one of the most popular fells in the Lake District on this challenging walk. Bowfell is is in Alfred Wainwright's 'best half dozen' Lake District fells. The views from the summit are magnificent with every main fell group in the Lake District visible including the Helvellyn range, the Langdale Pikes across Langdale and Scafell Pike towering above Eskdale. The route starts from the car park at Middle Fell Farm, just west of Dungeon Ghyll. From here you head west along the Oxendale Beck, passing Whorneyside Force Waterfall on the way. You continue west to Buscoe and the Three Tarns before coming to the summit. If you'd like to continue your climbing you could head to the Langdale Pikes - the start point for this route is close by.",
