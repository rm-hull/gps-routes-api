  "description": "This is another splendid stretch of the Northumberland Coast Path, with a historic castle, beautiful beaches, interesting villages and lovely bays to enjoy. It's an easy 3.5 mile walk on flat paths, so ideal for an afternoon stroll. Look out for wildlife including Arctic terns, and flora such as cowslips and harebells in the sand dunes. The walk starts in Warkworth near the castle. The atmospheric ruins of the 12th century castle are well worth exploring before you start the walk. From the medieval castle you follow the path north, crossing the River Coquet, before heading towards Birling Links and Birling Carrs on the coast. You then pass along the pretty beach with its attractive sand dunes, wildflowers and far reaching views. The walk then crosses the lovely River Aln Estuary before finishing in Alnmouth. The village is a picturesque coastal resort, popular with tourists. If you prefer you can start the walk from Alnmouth railway station and walk in the other direction. The St Oswald's Way long distance way passes through the area. Continue north on the path and you can visit the village of Craster on our Craster to Alnmouth Walk. There's also the striking Dunstanburgh Castle and the lovely Embleton Bay to visit near Craster. You could also try our Warkworth River Walk which visits the Norman St Lawrence church and the castle.",
