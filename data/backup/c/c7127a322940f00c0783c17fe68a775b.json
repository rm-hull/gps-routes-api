  "description": "These expansive woods are located in the Wicklow Mountains and include an extensive network of footpaths and mountain bike trails. The peaceful trails will lead you to pretty streams with photogenic waterfalls at the northern end of the site. At the eastern end of the woods you will find a car park where you can start your walk. The woods were part of the wider Powerscourt Estate where you can visit the picturesque Powerscourt Waterfall or enjoy a climb to the fine viewpoint at Maulin. This walk visits 'Ride Rock', where there are fabulous views down to the falls. The epic Wicklow Way also passes the eastern edge of the woods. You could pick up this waymarked trail to further explore the Wicklow Mountains.",
