  "description": "This circular walk takes you along the spectacular Curbar Edge in the Peak District. From the elevated position on Curbar Edge there are magnificent views over the Eastern Moors of the Peak District. The area is also covered with interesting rock formations. Look out for red deer on the moors and birdlife such as the Ring Ouzel, in the air. The walk starts from the Curbar Gap Car Park and soon picks up the footpath to take you along the gritsone escarpment of Curbar Edge. You'll pass unusual rock stacks and some woodland trails with fabulous views towards Big Moor and White Edge. It is a fairly easy walk without too much strenuous climbing. If you would  like to extend your walk then the wonderful, National Trust owned Longshaw Estate is a good option. It is located a couple of miles to the north and consists of miles of walking and cycling paths taking you through ancient woods, parkland and heather moorland. On the way you will pass Froggatt Edge which has some nice birch woodland and more great views. Curbar Edge is located just a few miles south west of Sheffield. The nearby village of Calver is also well worth a visit with its historic cotton mill and the River Derwent. You could pick up the Derwent Valley Heritage Way here and enjoy a riverside walk. A couple of miles to the south east you will find Birchen Edge. It's another geologically fascinating area with fine views over the Derwent Valley. The walk can also be started from the nearby village of Baslow if you prefer.",
