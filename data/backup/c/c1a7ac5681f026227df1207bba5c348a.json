This ancient tree is estimated to be about 4,000 years old; maybe twice the age of the church in whose graveyard it now stands. The siting of a church here may suggest an effort to put an obvious Christian stamp on a site that was already of religious or spiritual significance to a pre-Christian population, thus easing the transition of religion."

  "description": "This pleasant circular walk from the East Sussex village of Crowhurst takes you to the nearby Fore Wood RSPB Nature Reserve. You can reach the reserve by following the Bexhill link of the 1066 Country Walk north from the village. The waymarked trail will take you into Fore Woods where there are a number of walking trails to explore. These peaceful bluebell woods are run by the RSPB and include a number of steep-sided ravines (ghylls) where rare ferns grow. Keep your eyes peeled for birds including Marsh Tit, Redwing and Chaffinch as you make your way along the trails.",
