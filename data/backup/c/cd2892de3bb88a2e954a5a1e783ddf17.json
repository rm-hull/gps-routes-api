  "description": "Climb to the highest point in the Presili Hills on this challenging walk in Pembrokeshire. The hill stands at 1759 feet and commands wonderful views of the surrounding area. The walk starts at the Bwlch Gwynt car park on the B4329 and follows a woodland trail through the northern end of the Pantmeanog Forest before picking up a mountain track to the Foel Cwmcerwyn summit. Here you will find a trig point, a number of cairns and fabulous views. You can also reach the hill from the little village of Rosebush in the south-west. From the same car park you can also easily climb Foel Eryr. It's only about a half a mile climb from Bwlch Gwynt and makes a nice extension to the walk. Alternatively you could extend your walk by following the wonderful Preseli Hills Golden Road east to visit the Iron Age Hillfort at Foel Drygarn near Crymych.",
