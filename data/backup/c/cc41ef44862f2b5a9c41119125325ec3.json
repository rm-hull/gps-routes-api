  "description": "This interesting historical walk takes you along the Chilworth Gunpowder Mills near Guildford. The route follows the Tillingbourne River passing along the ruins of the old mills. On the site there's nice woodland trails, large old millstones and information boards with useful maps detailing the history of the mills. These were originally established in 1625 by the East India Company and finally closed in 1920. They became an important supplier of gunpowder to the Government during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. There are about 100 buildings to see some of which are still mostly in tact. You can start the walk on Blacksmith Lane which is just a short walk west from Chilworth Train Station. From Blacksmith Lane you head east along the waymarked trail for about a mile.",
