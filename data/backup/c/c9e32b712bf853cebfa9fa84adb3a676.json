  "description": "This delightful Gloucestershire village is located on the River Coln in the Cotswolds. The village has some noteworthy historic buildings including a large medieval dovecote and a Grade I listed church built mainly in the 11th century. This circular walk from the village takes you to nearby Bibury where you can visit the famous Arlington Row, a much photographed series of 14th century stone cottages. You can reach Bibury by following a pleasant footpath along the River Coln in a north westerly direction. After exploring the village you can then return on countryside trails, passing Coneygar Wood on the way. The route passes close to the neighbouring village of Coln St Aldwyns so you could take a small detour here if you wish. To continue your walking in the area you could head south to Fairford to explore the series of lakes at the Cotswold Water Park .",

Inside there's a modern interior with two cosy fires and a dining area. There's also a nice garden area out the front for warmer days. They are dog friendly and also have a small car parking area."
