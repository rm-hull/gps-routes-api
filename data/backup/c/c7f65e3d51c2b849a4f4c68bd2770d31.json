      "caption": "A section of the Severn & Wye Railway route from Chepstow to Tintern has been turned into a footpath & cycleway. Steeply graded as it leaves the Gloucester-Cardiff main line at Wye Valley Junction ground frame, it climbs steadily to clear the A48 road before levelling off towards the 1km long Tidenham Tunnel. Low level lighting is provided through the tunnel so as not to disturb resident bats. The line emerges high up above the river Wye on a ledge that follows the bends in the river to reach Tintern Quarry. Beyond that you can continue towards Tintern Abbey. Amazing a lot of railway infrastructure, track, sleepers, signals and buffer stops, have simply been abandoned by the side of the footway."

  "description": "This cycling and walking route runs along a disused railway line through the beautiful Wye Valley. The route runs from Sedbury to Tintern Abbey , passing Chepstow and the splendid Tidenham Tunnel on the way. Pick up the trail at the Wyedean School at Sedbury and then head east to pick up the rail trail. The path heads north from here, passing along the River Wye and through the adjacent woodlands. You finish in Tintern where you can explore the wonderful ruins of the ancient abbey. Please check the below for details on Tidenham Tunnel opening. This is generally during the summer months from April to October. On the route you will pass the Devil's Pulpit . The popular viewpoint lies just to the east of the route and provides wonderful views over the AONB. You can also pick up the Wye Valley Walk to continue your walking in the area.",
