  "description": "This pretty country park is situated on the River Stour in the Suffolk town of Clare.  In the park you will find the remains of the 13th Century stone castle keep and the old Clare railway station.  There is a riverside walk where you can see a variety of wildlife and a railway walk with details of the park's history. The Bury to Clare Walk and Stour Valley Path walking routes also run through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk if you have time.  The park is located about 10 miles south of Bury St Edmunds, while the lovely Sudbury Water Meadows lie a few miles east.",
