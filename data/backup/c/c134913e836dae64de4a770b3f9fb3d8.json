  "description": "Climb to the summit of Foel Fras on this challenging climb in the Carneddau mountain range in the Snowdonia National Park. The walk starts from the pretty seaside town of Llanfairfechan and climbs towards Garreg Fawr along the North Wales Coast Path. You continue to Pen Bryn Du before reaching the 770 m (2,526 ft) of Drum. From Drum you climb to Foel Fras with wonderful views down towards the pretty Llyn Anafon below. The summit of Foel Fras stands at 942 m (3,091 ft) making it one of the Welsh 3000s (mountains over 3000ft high). From the high pint there are wonderful views over Carneddau and the rest of Snowdonia. This route descends straight back to LLanfairfechan but you have other options if you'd like to extend your walk. You could continue south and climb to Carneddau Llewellyn, the second highest peak in Wales after Snowdon. This would take you past Garnedd Uchaf and Foel Grach. You could also descend back to Drum and head east to visit Pen Y Castell. As an alternative you can start the walk from the beautiful Aber Falls by heading left from the car park along the North Wales Coast Path towards Garreg Fawr. Then follow this route from there.",
