  "description": "This Staffordshire based village is located near Wolverhampton and Bridgnorth in the southern part of the county near the border with Shropshire. It's a nice place for a country walk with waymarked trails and a nearby canal for some easy waterside walking. This walk from the village takes you east to visit the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and the National Trust's Wightwick Manor. Start the walk in the village and follow Moor Lane south east to Great Moor where you can pick up the Staffordshire Way and the Monarch's Way. Follow the waymarked trails south east past Trescott and you can link up with the canal at Mops Farm Bridge. From here you can follow a pleasant section of the canal towpath north east past Castlecroft to Wightwick. Here you will find an historic Victorian half-timbered Manor House with a collection of paintings and ceramics. Outside there's some lovely gardens with orchards, pools, formal gardens, a Victorian kitchen garden and a mathematical bridge. There's also a tea room where you can enjoy some refreshments. You can extend the walk by continuing along the canal to visit the Smestow Valley Nature Reserve.",
