  "description": "This walk explores the pretty nature reserve in Uphill, just south of Weston-Super-Mare on the Somerset coast. The route also visits the remains of the Uphill windmill and climbs to Uphill Beacon for nice views over the area. You can start the walk from the car parking area on the southern outskirts of Uphill village. Then pick up trails heading south past the pretty boating marina to Walborough. The route then turns around and heads north to climb Uphill Beacon where you'll find the old windmill. There's great views to enjoy from here towards the coast and surrounding Mendip Hills. The route then descends past the old St Nicholas' church which is perched on an unusual large rock above the village. From here it is a short stroll back down to the car park.",

You could follow the footpath east and enjoy a climb to Bleadon Hill. You could also head south along the coast path to visit Burnham on Sea.
