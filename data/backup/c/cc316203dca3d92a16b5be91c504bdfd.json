  "description": "A stunning walk through the North York Moors National Park from Castleton to Whitby . The walk begins with a loop from Castleton which passes through Danby Head, Westerdale Moor, Farndale Moor and High Blakey Moor. You return to Castleton where you begin the next section through Esk Dale to Danby and then the climb to Danby Beacon . From here it leads to Leaholm, Glaisdale , Egton Bridge and Grosmont with several sections along the River Esk. The final section takes you through Sleights to the finish point at Whitby, on the North Sea. See the Sleights to Whitby Walk for more details on this nice section. The walk passes the North York Moors Railway which you can take for part of the route. The steam railway is a significant tourist attraction and may be the busiest steam heritage line in the world, carrying around 350,000 passengers in 2009.",
