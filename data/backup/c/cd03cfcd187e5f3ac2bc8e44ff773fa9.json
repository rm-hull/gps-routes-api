  "description": "This shared cycling and walking trail runs through the Amman Valley from Pantyffynnon to Brynamman via Ammanford. You'll follow a fairly flat traffic free path running along the River Amman with some splendid views to the surrounding mountains to enjoy on the way. The route starts just to the north of Pantyffynnon following the railway line and the river north east to Ammanford. Here you leave the river to follow roads through the town before coming to the river around Pontamman. Woodland and river trails then continue east to Glanaman and Garnant. The final section runs past Cwm Aman before finishing at Brynamman.",
