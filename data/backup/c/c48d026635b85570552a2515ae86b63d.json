  "description": "This walk takes you along a lovely section of Devon coast from Thurlestone to Hope Cove. It's just under 3 miles following South West Coast Path along beaches and cliff tops. Along the way there are excellent views over Bigbury Bay. The walk starts from Thurlestone village which is located slightly inland. You could also start from the public car park at Thurlestone Beach if you prefer. From the village you can follow footpaths west to meet up with the coastal path. The waymarked trail will take you south along Thurlestone Sands to Thurlestone Rock and Beacon Point. You then pass Woolman Point and Mouthwell Point before arriving at the picturesque Hope Cove. To extend the walk continue along the coast path on the Hope Cove to Salcombe Walk .",
