Like most of the Sussex rivers, the Ouse was an agricultural waterway, with an upstream traffic of bulk goods such as chalk, coal and stone, and a return traffic of agricultural produce. At Lindfield there was also a mill near this bridge. The canal ran into financial difficulties primarily caused by the new railways and became disused after the 1860s. The Ouse river flows past Lewes and into the sea at Newhaven."

  "description": "This attractive Sussex based village has a lovely large village pond and an historic High Street. There's also some fine walking trails on which to explore the surrounding High Weald and River Ousel Valley countryside. This walk from the village follows sections of the Sussex Ouse Valley Way and the High Weald Landscape Trail to one of the highlights of the area at Ardingly Reservoir . The walk starts by the picturesque village pond and heads north along the High Street. It's a lovely village street, lined with lime trees, and with over forty medieval and post medieval timber-framed houses. Near the 11th century church you can pick up the Sussex Ouse Valley Way and follow the waymarked trail north west past Kenwards Farm and Haywards Heath Golf Club. At Copyhold Lane you pick up the High Weald Landscape Trail and follow it north through River's Wood to reach the reservoir. Here you will find a footpath to take you along the eastern side of the water to the village of Balcombe . The area is a nature reserve with habitats including wetland, reedbed, deciduous woodland, hazel coppice and haymeadow. Near here you can also visit the impressive Ouse Valley Viaduct . The Grade II listed structure\u00a0carries the\u00a0London-Brighton Railway Line\u00a0over the\u00a0River Ouse and is particularly photogenic.",
