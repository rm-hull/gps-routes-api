  "description": "Explore the coastline, islands, river valleys, hills, villages, forests and farmland of Northumberland and follow in the footstepts of St. Oswald - the King of Northumbria in the early 7th Century, who played a major part in bringing Christianity to the region. The walk begins on Holy Island next to Lindisfarne Priory (video below) and heads to Belford before starting the wonderful coastal section from Bamburgh to Warkworth. The Northumberland coastline is really beautiful, passing Bamburgh Castle (video below), Beadnell Bay, Embleton Bay, Dunstanburgh Castle and Alnmouth Bay before finishing at Warkworth near the castle. The route then heads inland along the River Coquet to Rothbury before turning south through the Simonside Hills and Harwood Forest to Kirkwhelpington. The final section joins Hadrian's Wall at Halton Shields and leads you to the finish point at St Oswald's Church in Heavenfield. The church is believed to be the location where King Oswald (604 -642) raised a large wooden cross before the Battle of Heavenfield. The walk is often completed in the following sections: 1. Holy Island to Bamburgh (19 miles / 31 km) 2. Bamburgh to Craster (14 miles / 22 km) 3. Craster to Warkworth (13.5 miles / 21.5 km) 4. Warkworth to Felton and Rothbury (18 miles / 29 km) 5. Rothbury to Kirkwhelpington (15 miles / 24 km) 6. Kirkwhelpington to Heavenfield (17.5 miles / 28.5 km)"
