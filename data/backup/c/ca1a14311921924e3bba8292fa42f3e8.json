  "description": "This Cumbrian village is located near Ulverston and the south western boundary of the Lake District National Park. It lies on the Cumbria Coastal Way at the point where the River Crake flows into the estuary of the River Leven. This easy walk from the village takes you along the River Leven before heading north along the Rusland Pool. This picturesque stream runs through the Rusland Valley with some lovely views towards the Lake District mountains to enjoy on the way. Start the walk in the village where you can pick up the Cumbria Coastal Way and follow the waymarked trail east to the footbridge over the river. There's some fine views over the scenic Greenodd Sands as you make your way over the bridge. After about a mile to north to Lady Syke and Pool Foot where you pick up the footpath along the Rusland Pool. This will take you north past Bouth village towards Yew Barrow Fell and the Furness Fells.",
