  "description": "This Sussex based village has some nice trails through the surrounding woodland and countryside of the High Weald AONB. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring village of Forest Row before heading to the nearby Weir Wood Reservoir. The walk starts in the village and heads east to Ashurstwood Abbey before picking up the High Weald Landscape Trail on Cansiron Lane. Follow the waymarked footpath south and it will take you into Forest Row. The village is on the edge of the expansive Ashdown Forest where you can explore the area made famous in the Winnie the Pooh books by A.A Milne. After exploring the village you can then follow footpaths north west past Brambletye Manor to Weir Wood Reservoir. This large lake has some lovely waterside paths with a wildlife rich nature reserve at the western side. At the reservoir you can pick up the Sussex Border Path and follow this trail back to the village, crossing the Forest Way cycle route as you go.",
