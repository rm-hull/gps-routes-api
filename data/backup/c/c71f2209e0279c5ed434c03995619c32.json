  "description": "This is a terrific walking or cycling path running from St Martha's Hill in Guildford to Shoreham by Sea. The trail is suitable for walkers and cyclists and links the North and South Downs National Trails. It runs for a distance of just under 40 miles on a fairly flat off road path with great views of the Low Weald countryside. You start on St Martha's Hill with terrific views of the Surrey countryside before heading south to Cranleigh along the Wey and Arun Canal. The path continues to Rudgwick and then onto the delightful Southwater Country Park. The park is one of the highlights on the route with a series of pretty lakes and lots of wildlife to look out for. The next stage takes you to Henfield and then onto Bramber with its ruined 11th century Bramber Castle. The final stage runs along the River Adur taking you to Shoreham-by-Sea. You can extend the ride by heading east along National Cycle Network Routes to Brighton via Portslad and Hove. See the Guildford to Brighton Cycle Route for more details.",
