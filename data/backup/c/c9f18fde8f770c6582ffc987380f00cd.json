  "description": "This walk takes you along a section of the Thames Path to Hampton Court Park. It's about a 5 mile walk to the historic palace, so 10 miles there and back. The walk starts on Walton Bridge where you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it north east towards the riverside park, Sunbury and the pretty Sunbury Lock where there's an old lockkeeper's house and a weir. The route continues past Hurst Park before coming to Hampton Court Bridge. Here you can cross the bridge before finishing at the impressive palace. The 16th century palace has a fascinating history having been one of Henry VIII's most favoured residences.",
