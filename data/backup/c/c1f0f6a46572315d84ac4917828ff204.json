  "description": "This walk climbs to the Staple Tors in the Dartmoor National Park. The three tors are named Little Staple Tor, Middle Staple Tor and Great Staple Tor. They are located close to each other near Merrivale in a lovely scenic spot. You can start the walk from the car park at Pork Hill and follow footpaths north to the the three tors. There is the option of extending the walk to climb to the nearby Roos Tor where you will find a Logan Stone. Along the way there are excellent views over Dartmoor and several interesting rock formations to admire. If you'd like to extend the walk you could descend to the south east to visit the Merrivale Quarry, the Merrivale Prehistoric Settlement and Great Mis Tor. The Foggintor Quarry can be found a little further to the south.",
