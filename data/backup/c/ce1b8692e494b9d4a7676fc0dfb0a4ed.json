  "description": "This village in the North York Moors has some fine riverside trails, expansive local woodland and some excellent viewpoints to climb to. This circular walk from the village takes you along the River Derwent to the nearby Wykeham Forest. Start the walk in the village at the Hackness Grange Hotel and head south past Mill Farm to the bridge over the river. Cross here and then head west along the pleasant riverside path to Little Hill Green. You then turn south to cross the Sow Beck and head towards Mount Misery and the Wykeham Forest viewpoint at Highwood Brow. There's some fine views here over Troutsdale and Langdale to enjoy. The route continues east past Coomb Hill before passing Wrench Green and returning to the village.",
