  "description": "This is a fantastic climb to the summit of one of the Lake District's most well known and popular mountains. The walk begins at the parking lot in the pretty village of Threlkeld. You then climb Blencathra (or Saddleback) via Scales Fell, Scales Tarn and Sharp Edge. Sharp Edge is a challenging scramble along a narrow crest. Alfred Wainright describes it thus: 'The crest itself is sharp enough for shaving (the former name was razor edge) and can be traversed only a cheval at some risk of damage to tender parts.' From the summit there are fabulous views of the mountains of Galloway, the Southern Uplands, the Border hills, the Cheviots, the Pennines and North Wales.  Derwent Water and Thirlmere lakes are also visible. The walk descends to Knowe Crags and Blease Farm before returning to Threlkeld. For a shorter/easier walk to the summit please see the Blencathra Easy Route page. This starts from the elevated car park at the Blencathra Field Studies Centre, cutting out some of the ascent.",
