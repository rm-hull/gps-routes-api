  "description": "Climb to the highest point in the\u00a0far eastern section of the Lake District on this challenging circular walk. You can park at the Haweswater car park at Mardale Head at the southern end of the water to start your walk. You then pick up the footpath heading south west towards Small Water climbing along Mardale Beck. The path passes around Small Water to Nan Bield Pass before climbing to Mardale Ill Bell. At Nan Bield Pass you have the option of taking a detour and visiting Harter Fell. From Mardale Ill Bell you climb around Blea Water to the 828\u00a0metres (2,718\u00a0ft) summit of High Street. The views are magnificent with the Pennines, the Helvellyn range\u00a0and the\u00a0Southern Fells all coming into view. The route then descends to Long Stile and Rough Crag with wonderful views back down to Haweswater as you go. As an alternative you can head to \nBowderthwaite Bridge where you can pick up a section of Wainwright's Coast to Coast long distance footpath. This will take you west up to Kidsty Howes and Kidsty Pike before turning south to reach the summit of High Street. If you'd like to continue your walk you can pick up the footpath around Haweswater . The footpath along the western side of the lake is particularly lovely with areas of woodland, the pretty Measand Beck and The Forces waterfalls to enjoy.",
