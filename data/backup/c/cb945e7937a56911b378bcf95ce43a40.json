  "description": "Climb to the highest point in the far eastern section of the Lake District on this challenging circular walk. You can park at the Haweswater car park at Mardale Head at the southern end of the water to start your walk. You then pick up the footpath heading south west towards Small Water climbing along Mardale Beck. The path passes around Small Water to Nan Bield Pass before climbing to Mardale Ill Bell. At Nan Bield Pass you have the option of taking a detour and visiting Harter Fell. From Mardale Ill Bell you climb around Blea Water to the 828 metres (2,718 ft) summit of High Street. The views are magnificent with the Pennines, the Helvellyn range and the Southern Fells all coming into view. The route then descends to Long Stile and Rough Crag with wonderful views back down to Haweswater as you go. As an alternative you can head to Bowderthwaite Bridge where you can pick up a section of Wainwright's Coast to Coast long distance footpath. This will take you west up to Kidsty Howes and Kidsty Pike before turning south to reach the summit of High Street. If you'd like to continue your walk you can pick up the footpath around Haweswater. The footpath along the western side of the lake is particularly lovely with areas of woodland, the pretty Measand Beck and The Forces waterfalls to enjoy.",

      "content": "The Haweswater Hotel is perched right on the eastern side of the lake. There's a lovely outdoor terrace with wonderful views over the lake, towards Kidsty Pike. It's the perfect place to relax on a warm day. As an additional attraction the hotel has some pretty gardens to explore. There's mature trees and shrubs, including rhododendrons, maples and azaleas, interspersed with rock gardens, heather and alpine plantings. You may also see some of the tame red squirrels. The Crown and Mitre is a historic pub of some note. Located in nearby Bampton Grange, you will find this free house nestled in a wonderful location on the edge of the North Eastern Fells. It's a popular stopping point on the c2c walk and also provides accommodation. You can find it a couple of miles north of the lake at postcode CA10 2QR. There's also some nice riverside footpaths in the village if you fancy stretching your legs further."

      "content": "A few miles east of the lake you will find the historic ruins of Shap Abbey. If you have time the abbey and its associated park make for an excellent extension to your outing. There's nice footpaths along the River Lowther with the 12th century abbey ruins making a splendid backdrop. You could then head to the historic Greyhound Hotel in Shap village for some refreshments. The pub is a popular stopping point for people doing the coast 2 coast walk. It's set in a 17 century stone house and does very good food. It also has a series of picnic tables outside for warmer days. You can find the pub on Main St in Shap with a postcode of CA10 3PW for your sat navs. The pleasant waterside trails along Wet Sleddale Reservoir are also located in this area."
