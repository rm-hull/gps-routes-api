Opened in 1847 by the York & North Midland Railway on its line from York towards Castleford, this replaced the original 1839 station nearby. The 1847 building still stands besides the tracks. View north towards York, with the branch to Tadcaster and Harrogate having formerly diverged to the left just beyond the building. In 1904 the station was rebuilt with the entrance now being behind the camera position in Station Road."
