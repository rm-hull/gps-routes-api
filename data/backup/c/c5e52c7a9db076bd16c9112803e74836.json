  "description": "This Somerset village is located just west of Bristol. The area is run by the National Trust and includes a network of fine walking trails with bluebell woods and hills with views to the Severn estuary. This circular walk from the village explores the local woods and countryside, visiting the picturesque Abbots Pool and the neighbouring village of Long Ashton. The walk starts north of the village at Wraxall Piece woodland. Head west from here before turning north to Oxhouse Lane where you'll pass Durbans Batch. Here you turn east past Tanpit Woods before coming to Abbot's Pool. The attractive area is a nature reserve with birds, wild flowers, ferns and rhododendrons to see. Near the pool you can pick up the Monarch's Way and follow the waymarked footpath south to Round Hill Clump, Fifty Acre Wood and Long Ashton . To the east of the village you could take a detour from the route to visit the splendid Ashton Court Park Estate. The route then heads north past the Ashton Hill Plantation to return to Failand. This area of woodland includes some impressive redwood trees. Just to the west of the village you can extend the walk by visiting Tyntesfield House .",
