  "description": "This walk visits the splendid Temple Newsam, a Tudor-Jacobean house to the east of Leeds. The house is surrounded by attractive parkland and woodland with pretty ponds and gardens to explore too. There's also a rare breed conservation farm where you can get hands on with the piglets, chickens and geese. The walk starts from the car park next to the Grade I listed house and the Grade II listed stable block. You can then explore the 1500 acres of parkland by heading south towards Dog Kennel Hill and Dunstan Hill. There's also the beautiful gardens landscaped by the famous 18th century gardener Capability Brown. Afterwards you can explore the historic house which includes fine art, Chippendale furniture, silver, ceramics, and wallpaper.",

      "content": "Head east of the hall and you can try the Garforth Walk. This starts from the train station and uses the Leeds Country Way to visit the Aire and Calder Navigation Canal and the lovely RSPB St Aidan's nature reserve. There's excellent birdwatching opportunities and fine scenery here. Also not far is the splendid Lotherton Hall Estate near Aberford. The estate of this Edwardian house includes a deer park and a bird garden with 200 magnificent species including flamingos and snowy owls. Just north of the village you can pick up the Hazlewood Castle Walk and visit the nearby country estate. Here you'll find expansive bluebell woods and a mountain bike trail located to the west of the 18th century mansion which is now run as a hotel. Parlington Woods on the historic Parlington Hall Estate can be visited near here as well. If you follow the canal west it will take you into Leeds where you can try the Leeds Canal Walk on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. This visits the wildlife rich Rodley Nature Reserve and the historic Kirkstall Abbey before heading to Shipley. Head south from the park and you could pick up the Woodlesford Lock to Leeds Canal Walk. This takes you from the scenic lock at Woodlesford into the city centre along the Aire and Calder Navigation. On the way it passes the interesting museums at Thwaite Mills and the Royal Armouries. Also nearby are the villages of Barwick-in-Elmet and Thorner. Here you could visit Bramham Park where there are hundreds of acres of parkland, gardens, woodland and countryside to explore. The landscaped park surrounds the historic 18th century Bramham House which is a Grade I listed building."
