  "description": "This walk visits the splendid Temple Newsam, a Tudor-Jacobean\u00a0house to the east of Leeds. The house is surrounded by attractive parkland and woodland with pretty ponds and gardens to explore too. There's also a\u00a0rare breed conservation farm where you can get hands on with the piglets, chickens and geese. The walk starts from the car park next to the Grade I listed house and the\u00a0Grade II listed stable block. You can then explore the 1500 acres of parkland by heading south towards Dog Kennel Hill and Dunstan Hill. There's also the beautiful gardens landscaped by the famous 18th century gardener Capability Brown. Afterwards you can explore the historic house which includes fine art, Chippendale furniture, silver, ceramics, and wallpaper.",
