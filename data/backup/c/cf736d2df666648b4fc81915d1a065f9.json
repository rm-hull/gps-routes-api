The brook drains a large area from Botolph Claydon in the west, to Oving and Whitchurch in the south, and Mursley in the east, a distance east-west of about 10km."

      "caption": "King's Bridge. This is King's Bridge, a relatively modern girder and wooden deck bridge over Padbury Brook, about 300m west of the hamlet of Kingsbridge. The bridge is only wide enough for walkers and horse riders. It is most likely that this bridge has replaced an earlier one as the brook is fairly wide with few natural crossing places. It is not known why a bridge in a relatively remote spot should be called King's Bridge but elsewhere such a rural bridge might link two royal estates. The bridge is also a crossing point for a north-south footpath between Padbury and Steeple Claydon, which is also on the route of the Bernwood Jubilee Way, and a bridleway to the village of Gawcott to the west, the first part of which is on the route of the Cross Bucks Way, as is the bridge and the unmetalled road to Kingsbridge."
