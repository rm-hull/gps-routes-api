  "description": "A circular walk from the Wiltshire village of Sherston, visiting the nearby Luckington Court on the way. The walk runs for just over 4 miles, using a section of the Macmillan Way to take you to Luckington before following other country paths back to the village. It's a fairly flat route with nice Cotswolds countryside and views of the Sherston branch of the River Avon on the way. In Luckington you'll pass the 16th century Luckington Court. Both the interiors and exterior were used to represent Longbourn, the Bennet family home, in the\u00a0BBC's 1995 TV series\u00a0Pride and Prejudice. There's also a fine historic pub in Sherston to visit after your exercise.",
