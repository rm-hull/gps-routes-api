  "description": "This walk visits Castle Sinclair Girnigoe on the east coast of Caithness, Scotland. The walk begins at the car park on Noss Head Road, adjacent to the campsite. The route follows a scenic track, Castle Sinclair Girnigoe Drive, heading northwest along the rugged coastline. The terrain is a mix of grassy paths and firm tracks, offering stunning views of the dramatic cliffs and the North Sea. On the way, you\u2019ll spot seabirds such as fulmars, gulls, and terns, and if you\u2019re lucky, you might catch sight of dolphins or seals near the shoreline. Wildflowers and coastal grasses thrive in this exposed environment, adding to the natural beauty. Castle Sinclair Girnigoe itself is a remarkable ruin, perched on a promontory and offering insights into its tumultuous history as a stronghold of Clan Sinclair. Built in the late 15th century and expanded in the 17th century, it is recognised as one of Scotland\u2019s most historically significant ruins and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The castle\u2019s strategic position and architecture reflect its importance, but coastal erosion has contributed to its current state. Visitors can explore its remaining towers, courtyards, and gatehouse while enjoying panoramic views of the surrounding cliffs and sea. Continuing to Ackergill Harbour, the path leads to the picturesque site where small fishing boats still anchor. Nearby, Ackergill Tower, a 15th-century stronghold, stands as a testament to the area\u2019s layered history. The tower, once a site of skirmishes and family feuds, was later transformed into a luxury retreat and is now privately owned. The harbour and tower provide a striking contrast to the wild coastline and castle ruins. You can continue your walking in the area by heading south to visit the wonderful Whaligoe Steps. Head north and there's more fine coastal walking around the photogenic Duncansby Stacks and Dunnet Head .",
