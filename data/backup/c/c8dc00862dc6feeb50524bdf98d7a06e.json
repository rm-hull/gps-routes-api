  "description": "This pretty park in Hounslow includes 144 acres of woodland, meadow and wetlands. There's also views of the River Crane which runs along the eastern side of the park. You can start your walk from the visitor centre car park at the northern end of the park, next to the ancient St Dunstan's church which dates back to the 15th century. On the walk you'll see evidence of the old Cranford House, a manor house which has since been demolished. The 18th century stables and the aforementioned church are still in tact. The epic London Loop passes through the park. You could pick up this waymarked trail and follow it south to visit the popular Crane Park. To the north there's more easy waterside trails along the towpath of the Grand Union Canal Walk .",
