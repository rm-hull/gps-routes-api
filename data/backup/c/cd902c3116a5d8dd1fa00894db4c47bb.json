  "description": "This fantastic horseshoe ridge walk visits Pen Y Fan, Corn Du and the Cribyn in the Brecon Beacons National Park. It's a challenging hike but you will be rewarded with some simply stunning views over the surrounding peaks and reservoirs. The walk starts from the car park in Taf Fechan Forest and heads north to the beautiful Lower Neuadd Reservoir. You then climb west onto the Craig Fan Ddu ridge and head north with fantastic views toward Pen y Fan and Corn Du. The route climbs to the summit of Corn Du at 873 m (2,864 ft). Here you will find a well structured Bronze Age cairn and views to the Black Mountain range and Fforest Fawr. You continue a short distance to the 886 m (2,907 ft) summit of Pen Y Fan which is the highest peak in south Wales. There's more panoramic views here to the Bristol Channel, Carmarthen Bay, Swansea Bay, the Gower Peninsula, the Black Mountains, the Cambrian Mountains, Exmoor and the Clee Hills in South Shropshire can be seen. After taking in the views the route descends along Craig Cwm Sere to the Cribyn, standing at a height of 795 m (2,608 ft). The impressive views include Mynydd Epynt, the town of Brecon and the Cambrian mountains beyond. Look out for mountain birds including peregrine falcons, common buzzards and the red kite in this area. You continue the descent along Craig Cwm Cynwyn toward Bwlch Y Fan and Fan-y-Big. The final section descends past Tor Glas and the Upper and Lower Neuadd Reservoirs to the car park. To continue your walking in the area you can try our shorter alternative route to Pen Y Fan. It starts from the Pont ar Daf car park to the west of the mountain and is not quite as challenging. Also nearby is the climb to Fan Y Big and the Cribyn which starts from the lovely Blaen y Glyn Waterfalls .",
