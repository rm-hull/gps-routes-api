  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the village of Crackington Haven on the Cornish coast. The area is popular with walkers with interesting rock formations, a beach and fine views from the cliff tops. The walk starts from the Crackington Haven car park next to the beach. Here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it north past the waterfall to Castle Point. The route then heads indland to visit the little hamlet of St Gennys. There's a noteworthy old church here which dates from the Norman period. The walk then returns to the coast and follows the cliffs back to the car park. If you continue north along the coast path it will take you to Bude where you can enjoy a lovely waterside walk along the Bude Canal or visit the wildlife rich Bude Marshes .",
