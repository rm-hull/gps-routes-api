  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk or cycle along the Walsall Canal on this easy route in the West Midlands. The canal runs for about 8 miles through western Walsall with a nice towpath to follow along the water. It makes for a pleasant afternoon stroll or a nice flat ride suitable for beginners or families. Along the way you'll pass a series of pretty locks, interesting old mills and the Tame Valley Canal. Near the start of the route you pass close to Walsall Arboretum which is well worth a small detour. The route starts at Birchills Junction just to the east of Reedswood Park. You can also pick up the canal from the train station or bus station. It's about 5-10 minute walk from both. You follow the canal south through Birchills before turning west towards Darlaston. Here you pick up a section of the Monarch's Way heading to Moxley before finishing at Ryders Green Junction where you meet the Wednesbury Old Canal. If you would like to extend your exercise you could pick up the Birmingham Canal and head west towards Dudley, passing the Sheepwash Nature Reserve.",
