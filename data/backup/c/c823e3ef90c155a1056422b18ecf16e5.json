  "description": "This shared cycling and walking trail runs along the old Lincoln to Boston Railway Line from Lincoln to Woodhall Spa. The route runs for about 16 miles on a flat path making it ideal for a family cycle or an easy walk. On the way there's lovely fenland scenery, river views and a series of themed sculptures to look out for. Start off in the city centre in Lincoln where you cross to the southern side of the River Witham. You then follow the trail east passing Washingborough, Fiskerton, Rolleston and  Branston Island before coming to Bardney. Here you leave the riverside path to follow the trail to Southrey Wood before returning to the river at Southrey village. The trail then continues along the river to take you to Woodhall Spa.",
