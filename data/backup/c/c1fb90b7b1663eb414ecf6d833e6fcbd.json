  "description": "Explore the beautiful Marloes Peninsula on this circular coastal walk in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. It's a wonderful area with great views towards the nearby Skomer Island , spectacular cliff tops and fields with pink wildflowers and heather in the summer. The walk starts at the Martin's Haven car park near the excellent Lockley Lodge Visitor Centre. You then head towards the coastguard hut and Wooltack Point for great views across St Bride's Bay. You continue along the coast with more splendid views towards Skokholm and Grassholm islands. The area is wonderful for wildlife with wild ponies, gannets and seals to look out for in the autumn months. To continue your walking in the area you can catch the boat from Martin's Haven to the wonderful Skomer Island from April to October. If you head east you can visit the lovely Marloes Sands and Marloes Mere. Here you'll find a bird hide where you can look out for a variety of birds visting the little lake. Near here you can also visit the lovely Dale Peninsula where you can visit St Ann's lighthouse and Dale Fort.",
