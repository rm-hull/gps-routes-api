  "description": "This walk follows a section of the South West Coast Path from Mawgan Porth to Watergate Bay on the Cornish Coast. The walk runs for just under 4 miles along a cliff top path with splendid views throughout. You can start the walk from the public car park at Mawgan Porth. There's a lovely beach here with sand dunes and views of the River Menalhyl which flows into the sea at this point. From here you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it south west to Beryl's Point. You continue south to the photogenic Beacon Cove and Griffin's Point at the northern end of Watergate Bay. The final section runs along the beautiful long beach before finishing at Whipsiderry, just north of Newquay. You can extend your outing by continuing south on the Watergate Bay Walk. This will take you to Porth Island and Trevelgue Head. In Newquay you could also pick up the popular Newquay to Perranporth Walk .",
