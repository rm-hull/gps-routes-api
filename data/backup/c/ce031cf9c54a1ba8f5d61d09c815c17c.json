  "description": "This is a largely traffic free cycle ride or walk from Barking Abbey to Waltham Abbey via Three Mills, Limehouse Basin and the Olympic Park . The route starts at Barking Abbey and heads through Plaistow and Mill Meads to the Limehouse Basin. This section follows a cycle track for most of the way and includes a stretch along the River Lea. From Limehouse the route turns north through Victoria Park and Hackney Marshes to Lea Bridge where you begin a section along Tottenham Marshes and the Walthamstow Reservoirs which include West Warwick Reservoir and Lockwood Reservoir. The final section takes you through the lovely Lee Valley Park and along the River Lee Navigation Canal to the finish point at Waltham Abbey . As this ride is mostly on off road paths and tracks it is also suitable for walkers.",
