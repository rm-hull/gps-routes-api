  "description": "This Hampshire based village is located near Andover and Whitchurch in the valley of the Bourne Rivulet, a tributary of the River Test. It's a delightful area with numerous photogenic thatched cottages, peaceful woodland, pleasant countryside and river views. This circular walk from the village uses part of the Test Way to visit the neighbouring settlements of Hurstbourne Tarrant and Stoke. The walk starts in the village and follows the Test Way north west to Swampton and Wallop Hill Down before passing along the woodland trails in Doles Wood. After passing through the wood you come to Hurstbourne Tarrant where there are views of the River Swift. The route then retraces its steps to Wallop Down Hill and then picks up a footpath heading east to Stoke. You can then follow a country lane running along the Bourne Rivulet to return to St Mary Bourne.",
