  "description": "This cycle trail explores a lovely part of the Isle of Anglesey. The route runs for about 9 miles with some pleasant riverside trails, traffic free sections and a beautiful lake at the end of the ride. You start off in the south western corner of the island at the village of Malltraeth. The trail then heads north east along the Afon Cefni towards the market town of Llangefni. From here you continue north to the Dingle Nature Reserve. There's a nice tree lined boardwalk to stroll along here with various wildlife to see. Red squirrels, herons, buzzards and ducks can be seen on this interesting little trail. From here you continue north to reach the finish point at the picturesque Cefni Reservoir. The reservoir has some pleasant woodland, waterside trails and lots of wildlife to see on the water. Nearly 80% of the route is traffic free so is also suitable for walkers. To continue your riding in the area you could follow the southern section of the route to Newborough Forest where there are miles of excellent coastal walking and cycling trails to try. The long distance National Cycle Route 5 also runs through the area and provides more signed cycling opportunities.",
