But ships grew in size, the Blyth silted up, and Blythburgh shrank to the size of the small village it is today."

Below the famous Blythburgh Church, this bend in the river provides a tranquil spot to sit, though the busy A12 road runs across the scene (in the next square) with the tidal part of the river visible beyond. At one time the Halesworth to Southwold narrow gauge railway passed through this spot too. I could not find any trace of the line here, but the track can easily be followed a little further west."

  "description": "This small East Suffolk based village lies on the River Blyth near to Dunwich Forest, the Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve and the Walberswick Nature Reserve. It is also well known for the Grade I listed Holy Trinity Church, known as the Cathedral of the Marshes. The 14th century church has a fascinating history and is easy to spot at night as it has been floodlight since the 1960s. This circular walk from the village visits the Angel Marshes, Walberswick Nature Reserve and Westwood Marshes. The area is great for bird watching so bring your binoculars to look out for Bittern, Harrier and Oystercatchers. The walk starts in the village at Blythburgh Bridge and heads south east along the Angel Marshes on the River Blyth. You then head east through the woodland of Dead Man's Covert to Walberswick Common and the village of Walberswick. After exploring the village the route then heads north west along the Dunwich River to the Westwood Marshes area of the Walberswick Nature Reserve. Here you'll pass a number of pools before entering Dunwich Forest and enjoy some peaceful woodland trails. The route then follows country lanes north and then west to return to Blythburgh.",

The building is also charming being set in a former courthouse dating back to the 16th century. The inn retains a number of its original features, including ornate beams in the bar area and a large, handsome inglenook fireplace. You can find it on the London Road at postcode IP19 9LQ. On the route you could stop at the The Anchor in Walberswick. Located close to the beach it has a good sized garden area where you can relax on warmer days. You can find the pub at a postcode of IP18 6UA for your sat navs."

      "content": "The Suffolk Coast Path can be picked up in the Walberswick area and used to further explores the area. You could try the Dunwich to Walberswick Walk and Southwold to Walberswick Walk on the path. The beautiful Dunwich Heath is also nearby and has miles of trails to try. Head north and you will soon come to the splendid Benacre National Nature Reserve. There's lovely trails here around the tranquil Benacre Broad and associated beach. Continue west on the Blyth river and you will soon come to the neighbouring town of Halesworth. The town has some interesting history with a walk down the central Thoroughfare highly recommended. This pedestrianised area includes many buildings dating back to the sixteenth century. For more walking ideas in the area see the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Walks and the Suffolk Walks pages."
