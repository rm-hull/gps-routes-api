In the 15th century it was an important town, with a bustling quayside by the River Blyth, it thronged with merchants made rich by the Suffolk wool trade. But ships grew in size, the Blyth silted up, and Blythburgh shrank to the size of the small village it is today."

Below the famous Blythburgh Church, this bend in the river provides a tranquil spot to sit, though the busy A12 road runs across the scene (in the next square) with the tidal part of the river visible beyond. At one time the Halesworth to Southwold narrow gauge railway passed through this spot too. I could not find any trace of the line here, but the track can easily be followed a little further west."

  "description": "This small East Suffolk based village lies on the River Blyth near to Dunwich Forest, the Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve and the Walberswick Nature Reserve. It is also well known for the Grade I listed Holy Trinity Church, known as the Cathedral of the Marshes. The 14th century church has a fascinating history and is easy to spot at night as it has been floodlight since the 1960s. This circular walk from the village visits the Angel Marshes, Walberswick Nature Reserve and Westwood Marshes. The area is great for bird watching so bring your binoculars to look out for Bittern, Harrier and Oystercatchers. The walk starts in the village at Blythburgh Bridge and heads south east along the Angel Marshes on the River Blyth. You then head east through the woodland of Dead Man's Covert to Walberswick Common and the village of Walberswick. After exploring the village the route then heads north west along the Dunwich River to the Westwood Marshes area of the Walberswick Nature Reserve. Here you'll pass a number of pools before entering Dunwich Forest and enjoy some peaceful woodland trails. The route then follows country lanes north and then west to return to Blythburgh.",
