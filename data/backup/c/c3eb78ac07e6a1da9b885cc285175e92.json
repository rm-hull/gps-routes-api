  "description": "This splendid country park is in a beautiful location in Northwich , Cheshire. The park contains magnificent Lime avenues, an Arboretum and the delightful Budworth Mere . The Trent and Mersey Canal also runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk or cycle here. Marbury is also very close to Dairy House Meadows Park, Anderton Nature Park and the splendid Anderton Boat Lift . This remarkable feat of engineering is located on the canal and is one of the highlights of the area. The park is located just to the north of Northwich town centre and forms part of the wider Northwich Community Woodlands, an area of countryside with 11km (7 miles) of cycling and walking paths. To extend your walking pick up the Cheshire Ring Canal Walk and follow the towpath west towards Barnton and Bartington. Around here you can also pick up waterside paths along the Weaver Way which runs just to the south of the canal. Heading east and then south will take you towards Middlewich .",
