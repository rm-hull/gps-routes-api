  "description": "This park has a number of delightful walking and cycling trails and is located just outside Southampton. The farm is 600 years old with historic buildings, barns and the 13th century St Bartholomew's church. You can feed the chickens and get up close to rabbits, chicks and ducklings. There's also miles of peaceful woodland, river views and lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. The park sits within the wider River Hamble Country Park. The River Hamble runs along the eastern side of the park. If you head south you could pick up the River Hamble Walk which runs from the mouth of the River Hamble at Warsash to Bursledon. Hamble Common can also be accessed in this area.",
