  "description": "This Staffordshire based market town has some nice river and country trails to try. This walk from the town follows the Staffordshire Way south to the nearby Blithfield Reservoir . The walk starts from the train station where you can pick up the waymarked trail and follow it south passing the famous Uttoxeter Racecourse which is probably the town's most famous landmark. The trail then takes you into into the countryside towards Scounslow Green and Bagot Forest. You then pass the attractive village of Abbots Bromley before arriving at the reservoir. The large lake is located in the Blithe Valley and has three nice colour coded walking trails to try. It's also a great spot for bird watching with several different species visiting the lake. After enjoying the view across the reservoir the route returns to Uttoxeter on the same paths.",
