  "description": "Enjoy an easy waterside walk along the Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal, from Whitchurch to Marbury. It's a lovely section of the canal with lots of pretty locks, old bridges and nice views of the open countryside of Cheshire and Shropshire. Starting in the town centre you can follow The Marches Way and the Shropshire Way west past Jubilee Park to the start of the Whitchurch Arm. Follow the towpath round to the north, passing Danson's Bridge and Grindley Brook lock. You continue past Willeymoor Lock to Quoisley Bridge before coming into Marbury. The village is a lovely place for a stroll with a number of attractive meres to visit. Here you can look out for a variety of wildlife including gadwall, garganey and ruddy ducks at the Quoisley meres. Great crested, red-necked and Slavonian grebes, great and little bittern, Canada and pink-footed geese, coots, moorhens and mute swans can be seen at the Marbury meres. This walk finishes in the village but you could also pick up the South Cheshire Way and follow it south west to the canal at Grindley Brook. You could then return to Whitchurch along the canal from there. The Bishop Bennet Way also passes through the area.",
