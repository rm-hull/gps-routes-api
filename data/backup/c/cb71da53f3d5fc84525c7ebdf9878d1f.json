  "description": "This circular walk explores the RSPB's Freiston Shore nature reserve near Boston in Lincolnshire. The coastal reserve is located on The Wash, one of the most significant wildlife watching sites in the country. Look out for species such as ringed plovers, brent geese, hen harrier, knot, black tailed godwit yellowhammers and skylarks as you make your way around the site. You can start your walk from the RSPB car park at postcode PE22 0LY. Then pick up a circular footpath running for just under 3 miles around the lagoons and sea wall at the site.",

There's also a 360vr Lancaster bomber flight simulator and a series of WW2 coastal defences to see here. You can find them just south of the reserve at Shore Road, PE22 0LY. If you head west into nearby Boston you could pick up the Macmillan Way and enjoy a walk along The Haven river from the town. There's also another reserve located on The Wash nearby in the shape of Frampton Marsh. To the south is the Peter Scott Walk which travels along a Norfolk section of the Wash.
