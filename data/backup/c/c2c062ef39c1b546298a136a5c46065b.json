  "description": "Explore 300 acres of woodland and parkland in this popular country park near Hatfield. There's miles of good walking traills to follow around the 121 hectare (300 acre) site. The park consists mainly of ancient hornbeam woodland, with other trees including oak and silver birch. It's a pretty area with glades, streams, springs and lots of interesting plants and flowers. These include Honeysuckle, Bluebell and Foxglove. There is a car park at the southern edge of the wood, just of The Ridgeway. From here you can pick up trails to take you to Rowbourne Hill, Justice Hill and over Grimes Brook. The walk is generally fairly flat but there are some moderate climbs. The Hertfordshire Way runs through nearby Cuffley so this is a good option if you would like to extend your walk. You could also follow the Hertfordshire Chain Walk to the nearby Broxbourne Woods. These extensive woods have miles of cycling and walking trails and a delightful 1km sculpture trail with several beautifully carved wooden pieces. If you follow the trail south east towards Enfield you can visit Whitewebbs Park which has woodland trails, ponds and the Cuffley Brook.",
