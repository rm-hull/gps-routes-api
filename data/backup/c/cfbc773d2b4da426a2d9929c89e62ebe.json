The rock is 90 feet (27 metres) high and its summit is 50 feet (15 metres) lower than the nearby cliffs. Only pedestrians could enter the castle, and the access was defended by two bridges over gaps in the rock. The castle was in existence in 1455, when Sir Walter Ogilvy of Auchlevin was granted permission by King James II to add to and strengthen it. It passed briefly into the hands of the Gordons, and then returned to the Ogilvys, who finally abandoned it for the greater comfort of NJ5066 : Cullen House in the 17th century."

They have been folded by tectonic movements to the point that in some places they have been tilted beyond the vertical. This geological formation is the Findlater Flag Formation, named for the castle, and includes flaggy metamorphosed sandstones. Notice the sea surface, which is whipped up into a mass of white horses. The gales today were such that I was barely able to stand on the clifftop, and instantly abandoned as foolhardy my original plan of descending to the castle itself. There was so much sea spray that there were shifting rainbows all over the surface of the sea."

  "description": "This walk follows the coastal path from Cullen to the historic Findlater Castle. It's about a 2.5 mile walk from the village to the castle, passing along a cliff top path. Start the walk on the eastern side of Cullen Harbour and then head east to Muckle Hythe and Logie Head. You continue past the Tony Hetherington's Memorial steps and the scenic beach at Sunnyside before arriving at the castle. The castle sits in a wonderful position on a 50-foot (15 m)-high cliff overlooking the Moray Firth. It dates back to 13th century with the present remains largely from the 14th century. To continue your walking in the area you could head west from Cullen on the Cullen to Portknockie Walk which follows a section of the epic Moray Coast Trail . There's lovely beaches and more interesting geology to enjoy on this section of the path.",
