  "description": "This Hampshire based town is located near to some large areas of woodland and the attractive scenery of the North Downs . The large towns of Newbury and Reading are also close by. This walk from the town follows the Brenda Parker Way east to visit Pamber Forest and the ancient Roman Fort at Silchester . The walk starts in the village and heads east to explore Pamber Forest. The expansive area of woodland is a great place for walks and birdwatching. You continue east to Silchester where you'll find the remains of the fascinating Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum. Here you can enjoy a walk around the Roman Walls which are still visible for much of the circumference.",
