The Wheel leads onto an aqueduct and through a brand new canal tunnel to reach the higher course of the Union Canal, and replaces a long-disappeared flight of locks."

This bridge over the Forth & Clyde canal used to be a lifting bridge, but after the canal was cut by the building of the A80 dual carriageway at Castlecary, councils took great delight in infilling sections of the canal, and Townhead was no exception. The canal was culverted at this point and the gap infilled. When news of the reopening became a reality some 35 years later, the culvert was removed and a new bridge built to span the canal once more. To save money, no provision was made for the towpath to remain with the canal alignment, and walkers and cyclists must now use the ramp to reach road level to cross it. The only saving grace is that the council did provide a set of pedestrian crossing lights here."

Work on the re-opening project started in April 2000 and was completed in January 2001. The mechanical and electrical operating equipment and the control system were reinstated and the control building was rebuilt in its original style. The bridge pivots ('swings') out of the way to let boats pass."

  "description": "Follow the towpath of the Forth and Clyde Canal from Bowling to Falkirk on this super cycling and walking route. The route follows National Cycle Network Routes 7 and 754 so is well signed throughout. At Falkirk you can link up with the Union Canal which will take you into Edinburgh. As such you can cross central Scotland from Glasgow to Edinburgh on traffic free canalside paths. You start off at the Bowling Basin near to Bowling train station on the Glasgow suburban line. The path then heads through Clydebank and the outskirts of Glasgow, crossing the four-arched 120 metre long Kelvin Aqueduct and the Kelvin Walkway as you go. From the Aqueduct you continue to the town of Kirkintilloch passing Cadder, Bishopbriggs, a Roman Fort and the pretty Possil Loch on the way. From Kirkintilloch you continue to the nearby town of Kilsyth, passing along the River Kelvin and Dumbreck Nature Reserve. The final leg runs from Kilsyth to Falkirk, passing Bonnybridge and the Antonine Wall - a Roman turf and stone fortification bisecting Scotland. On the outskirts of Falkirk you'll come to the Falkirk Wheel - this rotating boat lift connects the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal lifting boats from the basin to the aqueduct 24 metres above. See the video below for a full description of this fascinating tourist attraction. After the Falkirk Wheel you complete the trip by passing along the canal into Falkirk and finishing at Falkirk train station. The canal forms part of our Glasgow to Balloch Cycle Route which takes you from the city centre to the banks of Loch Lomond on nice traffic free paths.",
