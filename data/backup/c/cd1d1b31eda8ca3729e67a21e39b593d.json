  "description": "Widdop Reservoir is located near Hebden Bridge in Yorkshire. This circular walk takes you around the reservoir and through some stunning scenery. You begin at the Clough Foot car park and follow Graining Water to the reservoir. You then climb to Great Edge Bottom and Flaugh Hill with great views of the reservoir and surrounding countryside. You return via Scar Hollow and Cludders Slack using the Pennine Bridleway long distance walking route. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Hardcastle Crags where you will find a beautiful woodland valley with streams and waterfalls. The Gorple Reservoir walk and the Walshaw Dean Reservoir walk also start from the same location.",
