Manor House, Church Lane, Shepperton, viewed from a boat not entering Desborough Channel but continuing along a winding, tree-lined and natural banks section of the River Thames. As shown by the record flood photograph in February 2014 on the Geograph project, its elevation spared the manor by over a metre from the flooding but flooded much of Desborough Island opposite."

At that time the railway station and the hotel were the only buildings in the area and it is evident that this part of Shepperton was subsequently developed solely because of the proximity of the railway route to London, the old village of Shepperton being some distance away to the south-west. At some stage the pub became the Crossroads and it does now occupy a prominent location at the junction of Laleham Road, Old Charlton Road, Green Lane and the High Street."

  "description": "This Surrey based village sits in a nice spot on a lovely section of the River Thames. There's much to enjoy with the historic Old Shepperton and the picturesque area around Shepperton Lock on the river. The village is also home to the famous Shepperton Film Studios. This circular walk from the village takes you along the river to Halliford Mere, Desborough Island and Walton Bridge. The walk starts from the public car park on the Las Palmas Estate. You could also start from the train station which is about a 10 minute walk from the river. From the car park you pick up the Thames Path National Trail and head west to visit Halliford Mere. The route then heads south to the river passing through Old Shepperton where there are a number of interesting shops and buildings around an attractive square. At the river you can catch a little ferry over to the other side in Weybridge . This pedestrian ferry service has operated almost continuously for over 500 years. From Weybridge you head east and then north, following a riverside path through Desborough Island. You then cross the bridge at Walton on Thames to Lower Halliford. Around here you could pay a visit to the Shepperton Marina which lies just to the east. This route heads west to return you to the finish point back at the car park.",
