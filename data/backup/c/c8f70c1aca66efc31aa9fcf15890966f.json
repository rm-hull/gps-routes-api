  "description": "This historic Yorkshire village is a lovely place to start a walk. There's several interesting old buildings, canalside trails, local hill climbs and old industrial sites to see. There's also a train station so it's easily accessible by public transport. This circular walk from the village train station explores the hills to the south of the settlement. You'll climb to Windle Hill, Weather Hill, Aaron Hill and Crow Hill which stands at 383 metres high. There are some excellent views over the surrounding moors, towns and villages from this elevated spot. The route then descends to Blackwood Common before coming to the Rochdale Canal. You can then enjoy an easy waterside stroll back to the village and the train station. The walk can be extended by following the canal east to Sowerby Bridge or West to Hebden Bridge. You'll also come close to Cragg Vale which lies just to the west of the route. The village is known for The Cragg Vale Coiners, a band of counterfeiters that produced fake gold coins in the late 18th century to supplement small incomes from weaving. It lies very close to the pretty Withens Clough Reservoir where there are some lovely waterside trails.",
