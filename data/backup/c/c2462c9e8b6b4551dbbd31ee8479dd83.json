  "description": "This village in Northumberland is located on the Hadrian's Wall Path National Trail. It's a significant spot which includes the longest section of unbroken wall at its original and planned width, now known as Broad Wall. The area also includes the noteworthy St Andrew's church where you'll find Saxon features dating back to 680AD. This walk from the village takes you along a section of the trail to visit the Tyne Riverside Country Park. The park features 200 acres of meadows, chalk grassland, woodland and river bank. It's located just over a mile south east of the village. On the way you will also enjoy a riverside section along the River Tyne which flows just to the south of the settlement. You can extend the walk by heading west along the river to visit Wylam. Here you could pay a visit to Stephenson's Cottage, the birthplace of railway pioneer, George Stephenson. For more information on the history of this section of the wall see the informative English Heritage page.",
