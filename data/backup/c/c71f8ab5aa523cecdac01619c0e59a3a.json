  "description": "This walk visits the site of Gelert's Grave in the village of Beddgelert in the Snowdonia National Park. The site is located just to the south of the village and includes a memorial to a legendary\u00a0wolfhound\u00a0associated with the village. The plaque describes the legend of the wolfhound who was slain by his master Llywelyn the Great for the supposed crime of\u00a0savaging his young child. In fact the loyal hound has been protecting the infant from the attack of another wolf. You can follow footpaths south along the River Glaslyn towards the site which lies on the western side of the river. There's some nice footpaths around the park with views of the surrounding mountains to enjoy. On the way you'll also pass the ancient St Mary's church which has retained some of its original medieval features. To extend the walk continue south through the wonderful scenery of the Aberglaslyn Pass on the rocky Fishermans Walk . You could also head north east to enjoy more waterside walks along the beautiful Llyn Dinas .",
