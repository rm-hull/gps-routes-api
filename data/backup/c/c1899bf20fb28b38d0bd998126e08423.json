  "description": "This South Yorshire town on the edge of the Peak District has several nice reservoirs and a popular local wood to visit. This circular walk from the town visits the nearby Broomhead Reservoir and More Hall Reservoir just to the south of Stocksbridge. The walk starts in Royd on the south eastern edge of the town. From here you can pick up footpaths heading south to Round Hill and then west to Bolsterstone. You continue south to Ewden village where you can pick up the footpaths heading around the two reservoirs. There's nice trails alongside both bodies of water which are surrounded by attractive woodland and countryside. After rounding the reservoirs you can follow the same paths back into Stocksbridge.",
