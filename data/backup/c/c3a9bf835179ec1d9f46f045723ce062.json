  "description": "This 171 hectare broad-leaved woodland has three colour coded, waymarked walking trails to try. They are all easy trails making the woods an ideal location for a peaceful afternoon stroll. In the woods you'll find a pond with a variety of wildlife, pretty wild flowers and a number of woodland birds. Look out for tadpoles, baby frogs and spiders around the pond and butterflies near the wildflowers. The woods are located just north of the little Derbyshire village of Whitwell. It's just a short stroll from the village centre to the entrance of the woods off Clinthill Lane. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head a few miles south to Cresswell Crags. Here you will find a wonderful limestone gorge with a waterside footpath running along Crags Lake with views of the surrounding caves and cliffs.",
