  "description": "Explore the beautiful parkland and gardens surrounding the marvellous, 15th century Athelhampton House. The gardens are a delight with footpaths taking you to topiary pyramids, fountains and the 15th century dovecote. The River Puddle also meanders through the park so you can enjoy riverside views too. To continue your walking in the area head to the nearby Thorncombe Woods and Puddletown Forest. There's miles of woodland trails and a visit to the fascinating Hardy's Cottage where you can learn all about the 19th century author's connection to the local landscape.",
