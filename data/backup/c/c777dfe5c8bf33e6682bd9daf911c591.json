    "description": "This pretty Norfolk village is located in a pleasant spot on the River Wensum, near Swanton Morley and Dereham. This walk from the village takes you to the Sparham Pools Nature Reserve which lies just to the north east of the village. The reserve is run by Norfolk Wildlife Trusts and includes some pleasant footpaths along the River Wensum and around a series of pretty lakes. The site is great for bird watching with goosander, shoveler, gadwall, mallard, pochard and tufted duck to look out for. You can follow a section of the Wensum Way to the reserve. The long distance trail runs through the village and can be followed to Lenwade to extend the walk. The Walsingham Way also passes through the village. You could use both these trails to create a longer circular walk through the area.",
