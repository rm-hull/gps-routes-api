  "description": "Climb to the Meikle Bin mountain on this splendid walk in the Carron Valley. It's a challenging climb with the summit rising to a height of nearly 1900ft. The walk starts from the Todholes car park at the northern end of the Carron Valley Reservoir. From here you pick up the waymarked trail and head south through the forest to Bin Bairn. The rest of the route climbs to Meikle Bin where there are fabulous views to the coast and the surrounding hills and mountains. To continue your walking in the area you can try the Loch Shore Trail at the southern end of the Carron Valley Reservoir. It's another well signposted trail with more great views over the water.",
