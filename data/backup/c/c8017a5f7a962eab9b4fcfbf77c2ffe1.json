  "description": "This historic castle in Belfast includes a lovely country park with miles of walking trails to try. This circular walk from the castle explores the immediate grounds before taking you through the castle woods to the excellent viewpoint at Cave Hill. On the way you can look out for lots of wildelife including long-eared owls and sparrowhawks. Start the walk at the castle car park where you can pick up trails taking you around the beautiful grounds where you can see the lovely gardens and the photogenic fountain. After exploring the grounds head north east to enter the peaceful woodland trails which will take you up to Cave Hill Cave. From the cave you head south to visit the Cave Hill summit where you can enjoy glorious views over the city to Belfast Lough, the coast, the Isle of Man, Scotland and the Mourne Mountains. After taking in the views you continue south to McArt's Fort before descending back through the woods to the castle. There's excellent facilities at the site with a visitor centre, antique shop, Millennium Herb Garden, restaurant, and a playground for children. There's also a fun cat hunting game where you can look out for a series of model cats around the garden area.",
