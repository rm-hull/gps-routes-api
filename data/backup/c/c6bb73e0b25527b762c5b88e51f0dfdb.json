  "description": "This circular walk explores lovely Littondale in the Yorkshire Dales. The route runs for just under 5 miles with some small climbs on the way. There's lovely river paths and fine views to the surrounding hills to enjoy. The walk starts in the little village of Litton, located on the River Skirfare. From here you can pick up footpath heading north west to Nether Hesleden. You continue following the course of the river to Halton Gill. This little hamlet is situated at the northern end of Littondale. The route then turns around and follows a country lane back to Litton, with more nice river views on the way.",
