      "caption": "The Lower End of Llyn Peris Mr W H Brinckman, formerly of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, was appointed manager at Dinorwig in the late 1880s. He soon introduced a punitive code of rules. One of these restricted the number of workmen who could convey an injured colleague to the hospital. One day, by Pont y Bala, he met a large group accompanying a seriously injured workmate. Waving his stick in the air he confronted them and ordered the men back to work. Someone shouted \"I'r llyn a fo\". Several men grabbed Brinkeman and promptly threw him into the lake. He was wise enough on that occasion not to take any further action against the men."

  "description": "This walk explores Llyn Peris and Dinorwic Quarry in the Padarn Country Park . The walk starts at the northern end of the lake where you can pick up the zig-zag path and climb above the lake. The path heads up through the slate waste heap providing excellent views back down to the lake. The trail heads north before turning east to take you through the striking scenery of the old quarries. You'll then descend to the southern end of the lake near Nant Peris.",
