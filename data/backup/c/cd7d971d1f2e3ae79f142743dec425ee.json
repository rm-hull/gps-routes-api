  "description": "This walk takes you through a stunning narrow gorge in the Snowdonia National Park. The path runs along the running waters of the River Glaslyn with waterfalls, interesting vegetation and wonderful views of the surrounding mountainous scenery. The Welsh Highland Railway runs through the pass so look out for their splendid steam trains as you go. The walk starts from the National Trust car park in Nantmor village south of Beddgelert. From here it is a short stroll to the the fisherman's path which will take you along the side of the Aberglaslyn gorge and the River Glaslyn. The path runs for just over a mile to Beddgelert with mature oak woodland and old bridges over the river to observe. The village of Beddgelert is very picturesque with a fine bridge crossing the River Colwyn and a number of good pubs for refreshment. You can of course start the walk from here if you wish. Part of the walk uses the Fishermans Walk, a rocky path running along the river. The longer circular walk will take you to Llyn Dinas before climbing into the surrounding hills. On the western side of the river you can extend the walk by visiting Gelert's Grave. Here you will find a memorial to the legendary wolfhound associated with the village. It's a popular local walk with the ancient St Mary's church another highlight here.",
