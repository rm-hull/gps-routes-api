  "description": "This walk makes use of three of the waymarked trails which pass through the town. You'll follow sections of the Barnstaple Heritage Trail, the Tarka Trail and the Macmillan Way to explore the town before enjoying riverside footpaths along the River Taw. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the Barnstaple Heritage Trail which takes you to some of the significant buildings in the town. Highlights include the Queen Anne's Walk (formerly The Mercantile Exchange), completed in 1713 as a meeting place for the town's merchants.  Today the building houses the Barnstaple Heritage Centre and the area in front is inset with a mosaic depicting Barnstaple's history. There's also the noteworthy Dodderidgian Library which was founded in 1667 and is a Grade II listed building. It represents one of the earliest town libraries in England which continues in existence since its foundation. After exploring the town the route picks up riverside footpaths along the River Taw. You'll pass Barnstaple Long Bridge an interesting medieval bridge which links the town with Tawstock. The path heads south east along the Tarka Trail, leading you through Rock Park, before crossing the river on a footbridge. On the other side of the river you pick up the Macmillan Way and follow it north to Barnstaple Long Bridge which you then cross. From here it is a short walk back into the town where the route finishes. To continue your walking around the town pick up the South West Coast Path and head west to visit the lovely settlements of Appledore, Instow and Bideford. There's lovely walks here along the River Torridge and through the nearby Northam Burrows Country Park .",
