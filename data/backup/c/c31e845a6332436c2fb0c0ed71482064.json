  "description": "The market town of Stroud has several long distance walking trails running through it and a number of woods, parks and hill climbs to try. As such it's a fantastic place for walkers and makes a great base for exploring this lovely area of the Cotswolds. This route is a popular walk along the Stroudwater Canal to the village of King's Stanley using a section of the Cotswold Canals Walk and the Cotswold Way National Trail. The walk starts in the centre of Stroud, near the train station. Here you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it west to Cainscross. The path continues to Ryeford where you head south on the Cotswold Way to King's Stanley. Here you can visit the 12th century parish church of St George before heading back to the town. You can extend the walk by continuing along the trail south to Middleyard where you will find Pen Hill and Pen Woods. Just to the east of King's Stanley you can enjoy more walking trails across Selsley Common with its variety of flora and fauna. For nice circular walks near Stroud try the Slad Valley Walk or explore Rodborough Common , just to the south of the town.",
