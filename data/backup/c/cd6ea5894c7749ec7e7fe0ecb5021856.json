  "description": "This walk visits Wolfscote Dale in the Dove Dale area of the Peak District. You can start the walk from the village of Hartington just north of the dale. There's a car park and cafe in the village so it makes a good start and end point for the walk. The footpaths then head south to Beresford Dale Nature Reserve where there's riverside paths, weirs, woodland, wildflowers and birdlife to enjoy. The route then crosses a wooden footbridge and leads you into the Wolfscote Dale Nature Reserve. The footpath winds its way along the River Dove with woodland sections and a number of weirs to enjoy. It's a beautiful area with the option of continuing south along the river to Milldale and then on to Dovedale. You could also visit the nearby Ilam Park where there are beautiful gardens and views of the River Manifold. Just to the east of Wolfscote Dale is the Biggin Dale Nature Reserve. You could return to Hartington on the footpath through the reserve. It's a lovely area with lots of interesting plants and flowers to look out for. The dale is located near to the pretty village of Alstonefield which makes a worthy alternative start point for the walk. You could enjoy post walk refreshments in the lovely beer garden at the George Inn Pub on Church Lane in the village centre. The noteworthy inn dates from the 18th century and is situated in a lovely spot on the village green.",
