Although there has been a religious house on this site since the 7th century, the priory that we see today date from the early 12th century when, after the alleged discovery of the bones of St. Milburge, it became a pilgrimage destination. Its predecessor had been re-founded after the Norman conquest and dedicated to Saints Michael and Milburge. In January 1540, during the dissolution of the monasteries, the priory was closed and, with the exception of the part which was converted to a private residence \u0096 it still is \u0096 the fabric of the buildings was pilalged for local farms and cottages."

  "description": "Wenlock Edge runs from Craven Arms\u00a0to Much Wenlock, in the Shropshire Hills AONB. This walk follows the 19\u00a0mi (31\u00a0km)  limestone escarpment using the footpaths of the Shropshire Way and the Jack Mytton Way long distance routes. The walk begins in the town of Craven Arms, near to the train station. You then head to the 400-million-year-old limestone escarpment following the pretty Quinny Brook out of the town. The walk passes ancient woodland, the 19th century Flounders' Folly and the Elizabethan Wilderhope Manor. There are some challenging climbs on the walk but you are rewarded with splendid views over Corvedale and the Shropshire Hills. The walk finishes in the interesting town of Much Wenlock where you will find Wenlock Priory - a ruined 12th century\u00a0monastery with a lovely topiary garden. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then the Long Mynd , Caer Caradoc Hill and the beautiful Carding Mill Valley are all nearby. You could try our circular walk around Much Wenlock which visits the fascinating ruins of the 12th century Wenlock Priory. There's also our Wenlock Edge Circular Walk which starts from the town and visits the historical site of Major's Leap.",
