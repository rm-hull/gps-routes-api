  "description": "Climb to this magnificent limestone viewpoint on this walk in the Wye Valley. You can start the walk from the south western end of the village of Woodcroft. Follow woodland trails to the quarry and up to the viewpoint. It's a lovely spot with the limestone cliffs and splendid views down to the river below. The crag is a very popular spot for rock climbers with hundreds of routes with several overhangs on the impressive cliffs. After passing Wintour's Leap you can follow the footpath round the river to Lancaut and the remains of St James' Church, once the centre of a medieval village. It's a lovely spot with the church ruins overlooking the river and a plaque describing the history of the abandoned village. Part of this route uses the Offa's Dyke Path so you could continue along the trail to extend your walk. If you head north you can visit the splendid viewpoint at the Devil's Pulpit .",
