  "description": "Climb to this magnificent limestone viewpoint on this walk in the Wye Valley. You can start the walk from the south western end of the village of Woodcroft. Follow woodland trails to the quarry and up to the viewpoint. It's a lovely spot with the limestone cliffs and splendid views down to the river below. The crag is a very popular spot for rock climbers with hundreds of routes with several overhangs on the impressive cliffs. After passing Wintour's Leap you can follow the footpath round the river to Lancaut and the remains of St James' Church, once the centre of a medieval village. It's a lovely spot with the church ruins overlooking the river and a plaque describing the history of the abandoned village. Part of this route uses the Offa's Dyke Path so you could continue along the trail to extend your walk. If you head north you can visit the splendid viewpoint at the Devil's Pulpit .",

      "content": "The riverside Lancaut Walk passes the hill before heading on to Chepstow where you can visit the historic castle. A few miles to the north you could visit the interesting village of St Briavels. Here you will find the historic St Briavels Castle which dates back to the 12th century and is open to the public under the care of English Heritage. The village can be accessed by crossing the Bigsweir Bridge over the Wye from Llandogo in Wales to St Briavels in England on the other side. In Llandogo you can enjoy a walk to the pretty Cleddon Falls on the River Cleddon. Head north west into Wales and there's the historic ruins of Tintern Abbey and Tintern Old Station to see. These can both be accessed on the circular Brockweir Walk which starts from the picturesque riverside village. On the opposite side of the river there's the 365 steps path up to the Eagle's Nest viewpoint at Wynd Cliff. The site has been described as \"one of the most impressive viewpoints in the British Isles\".  For more walking ideas in the area see the Wye Valley Walks page."
