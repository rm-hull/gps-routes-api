  "description": "This walk follows a lovely section of the Northumberland Coast Path from Craster to Seahouses. Along the way you'll pass lovely beaches, attractive sand dunes, a dramatic coastal castle and a nature reserve with excellent wildlife spotting opportunities. The route runs for about 10 miles, following a reasonably flat section of the long distance St Oswald's Way. As such there is scope for extending the walk if you have time. Starting in Craster you head north past the pretty harbour with its little fishing boats. The route continues to the striking Dunstanburgh Castle. The fortification was built in the 14th century, being one of the largest and grandest castles in Northern England at the time. The dramatic ruins are now a popular tourist attraction, standing on a remote headland with fine views of Embleton Bay and Craster. The walk continues north to the lovely Embleton Bay where there's a nice beach and a sand dune system. Near here you will also pass Newton Pool Nature Reserve where you can use the bird hides to look out for Herons and Barn Owls. The next stage takes you past Newton Haven to Beadnell Bay where there is a lovely long beach. You then pass through the village of Beadnell before starting the final section to Seahouses. This passes the pretty Annstead Burn and Annstead Beach. It's a delightful finish to the walk with more sand dunes and wildlflowers such as Dog Rose and Marram Grass. The walk finishes at Seahouses Harbour, a working fishing port, which also serves the tourist trade, being the embarkation point for visits to the Farne Islands. You can extend your walk by continuing north along the St Oswalds Way to the dramatic Bamburgh Castle on the Seahouses to Bamburgh Walk .",
