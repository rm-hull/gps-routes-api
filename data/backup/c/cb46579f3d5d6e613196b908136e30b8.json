  "description": "This pretty Buckinghamshire hamlet is located just south of Fingest and Turville in the Hambleden Valley area of the Chiltern Hills. This circular walk from the hamlet visits the neighbouring villages and the Cobstone or Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Windmill. The windmill was used in the filming of the 1967 film \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\". It's something of a local highlight with some fine views of the countryside to enjoy on the way too.",

      "content": "The Frog is the village's only pub. The 18th century former coaching inn has a cosy interior with a large roaring fire (throughout the winter months), which is surrounded by leather and oak seating. Oak beams, bar and floorboards combined with colourful textiles make the pub a relaxing place for your post walk refreshment. They also have a garden area, car parking and a great food menu."
