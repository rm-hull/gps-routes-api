  "description": "A short walk or cycle through the pretty Sheldon Country Park in Birmingham. The park covers just over 300 acres and includes open grassland, wetlands and mature woodland. There is also a restored Rectory Farm with Jersey cattle, pigs, goats, ponies, ducks, chickens and geese. A local cycle route runs through the park as does the Solihull Way walking route. This can be followed to the nearby Kingfisher Country Park. The route outlined below also runs onto the nearby Elmdon Park and House which is worth seeing if you have time. The park is located next to Birmingham International Airport, near to the NEC.",
  "details": [
    {
      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "The circular Solihull Walk can be picked up nearby. It visits several of the local highlights including the Grand Union Canal, the Stratford Upon Avon Canal, Knowle, the National Trust's Baddesley Clinton, the bluebells in Hay Wood and the lovely Earlswood Lakes. Head north from the park and you could pick up the River Cole Valley Cycle Route. The shared walking and cycling path can be followed all the way to Yardley Wood along the river. It's a 10 mile route along a nice flat trail, passing through the Birmingham suburbs and linking with the Grand Union Canal Walk. On the way it also passes the noteworthy Sarehole Mill. The 16th century mill is notable as Birmingham's last surviving water mill and well worth a visit. Near the mill there's the Moseley Bog Nature Reserve to explore as well. Here you can enjoy more easy trails around the ancient woodland with lots of wildlife to see on the way. Just to the south west there's some easy trails along Olton Reservoir, the home of Olton Mere Sailing Club. For more walking ideas in the area see the West Midlands Walks page."
