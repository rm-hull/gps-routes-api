  "description": "A short walk or cycle through the pretty Sheldon Country Park in Birmingham. The park covers just over 300 acres and includes open grassland, wetlands and mature woodland. There is also a restored Rectory Farm with Jersey cattle, pigs, goats, ponies, ducks, chickens and geese. A local cycle route runs through the park as does the Solihull Way walking route. This can be followed to the nearby Kingfisher Country Park . The route outlined below also runs onto the nearby Elmdon Park and House which is worth seeing if you have time. The park is located next to Birmingham International Airport, near to the NEC.",
