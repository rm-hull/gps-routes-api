There are a number of walking trails taking you through ancient woodland, grassland, heath and scrub. The park is excellent for cycling having been used for the mountain bike competitions at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The course is a 5.5 km long figure of eight and is of a very high standard - see the video below for an idea of what you can expect. If you want to continue your activity then Linn Park is just over a mile west of Cathkin Braes.",
