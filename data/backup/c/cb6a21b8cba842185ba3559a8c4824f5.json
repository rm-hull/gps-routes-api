There's also the Dronfield Arms which became Dronfield's first brewpub when a brewery kit was installed downstairs in the former restaurant in 2015. This is on display to customers through a glass panel in the floor of the main bar. They are dog friendly and can be found at S18 2XE. In Holmesfield there's The Angel. They serve good quality dishes with lots of Vegetarian and vegan options. There's a splendid large garden outside for warmer days. Postcode is S18 7WT. The village itself is also an interesting place for a stroll with 43 buildings listed as historically or architecturally significant. To the north of the village is Woodthorpe Hall which dates to the 17th century."

      "content": "To continue your walking around Dronfield you could try the woodland trails in Shillito Woods or climb to Birchen Edge for fine views over the area. The route is also coincident with the Sheffield Country Walk at the northern end. The circular walk explores the area around the city visiting a series of picturesque reservoirs on the way. To the west you can pick up the circular Barbrook Reservoir And Stone Circle Walk. The route visits a scenic 19th century reservoir and an ancient stone circle on Big Moor and Ramsley Moor. Next to the moors there's White Edge where you'll find more wonderful geology and pretty heather."
