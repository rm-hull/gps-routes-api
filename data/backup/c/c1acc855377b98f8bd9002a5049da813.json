  "description": "This ruined medieval castle in the Peak District has an amazing history stretching back to the Norman Conquest of 1066. This circular walk uses the Limestone Way and other public footpaths to take you around the castle ruins from the village of Castleton. There's some wonderful Peak District Scenery to enjoy and you will also pass the fascinating Peak Cavern. You can tour the cave to see unusual rock formations, and hear the eerie sound of the running waters. Peak Cavern has the largest natural cave entrance in the British Isles. If you'd like to extend your walk you could climb to the spectacular Winnats Pass and on to Mam Tor .",
