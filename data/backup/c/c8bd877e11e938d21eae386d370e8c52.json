  "description": "This circular walk on the edge of the Wyre Forest visits Eymore Wood and Trimpley Reservoir. There's nice woodland trails and a path along the reservoir to enjoy. You can park at the Eymore Wood car park to start your walk. Then follow footpaths south to the two reservoirs. Here you cross the Severn Valley Railway before picking up the Severn Way which runs between the reservoir and the river. The path heads along the river towards Upper Arley before cutting back across the woods to the car park. The river and reservoir are great for wildlife watching with kingfishers, grey herons and goosanders to look out for on the water. Pheasants, cuckoos and woodpeckers can be seen in Eymore Wood. The Worcestershire Way long distance footpath passes through the wood so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Following it north east will take you to Kingsford Country Park and Kinver Edge. Following the Severn Way north will take you to the lovely Arley Arboretum. The Upper Arley Circular Walk visits the arboretum and the reservoir. Our Severn Valley Railway Walk starts from Bewdley and also visits the reservoir and Upper Arley.",

Head north along the river and you will soon come to the popular Severn Valley Country Park. There's a 126 acre park to explore here with lots of wildlife and an informative visitor centre. Near here there's the worthy village of Hampton Loade where there's a Severn Valley Railway station and a 17th century pub by the river. For more walking ideas in the area see the Staffordshire Walks page."
