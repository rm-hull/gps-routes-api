  "description": "This Cheshire based town is great for waterside walking with a delightful local mere and canalside paths to enjoy. There's also several waymarked long distance trails running into the surrounding hills and countryside. This circular walk from the town climbs to Bosley Cloud before a long waterside stretch along the Macclesfield Canal . It makes uses of a few of the waymarked footpaths to the east of the town. The walk starts at the train station in the town centre where you can pick up the canal towpath along the Cheshire Ring Canal Walk . Head east towards Brookhouse Farm where you leave the canal to pick up the Staffordshire Way and Gritstone Trail . Follow the waymarked paths east to Timbersbrook before climbing north east to the cloud summit. After taking in the views the route continues east to meet with the Dane Valley Way at Cloudwood End Farm. Follow the trail north and it will link up with the canal. Near here you can take a detour to visit Bosley village, Bosley Locks and the Bosley Reservoir which lies just to the east. This route picks up the canal towpath again and follows it west back into Congleton.",
