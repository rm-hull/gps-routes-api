  "description": "This fantastic forest park in Rostrevor has miles of good walking trails to try. This walk takes you along the pretty Glen Stream before climbing to Slieve Martin for great views over the area. Carlingford Lough , the Norman Narrowwater Castle and the surrounding Mourne Mountains are clearly visible from the summit.  You can also enjoy easier footpaths along the Kilbroney River and through the Fairy Glen in Kilbroney Park at the start of the route. In Rostrevor Forest there are also a series of great mountain bike trails. This route is designed for walkers but the cycling trail are also highlighted on the map in blue. They take you north from near Slieve Martin to Slieve Meel and around Crenville. With a 27km red trail and a hair raising 19km black trail Rostrevor is believed by many to be the top spot for mountain biking in Ireland. For more great sites with mountain biking and walking on the east coast head to Tollymore Forest Park , Castle Ward and Castlewellan Forest Park .",
