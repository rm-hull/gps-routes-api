  "description": "This area of common land is located near the village of Rotherfield Peppard in the Chilterns area of Oxfordshire. It's a nice place for a stroll with heather, gorse, woodland, meadow and views of the cricket pitch. The common is also good for wildlife spotting with a variety of species of bird to look out for. Adjacent to the village is Sonning Common where you can extend your walk if you have time. Here you can pick up the long distance Chiltern Way and follow it to Crowsley Park where you can see a fine old mansion and the BBC's satellite dishes.",
