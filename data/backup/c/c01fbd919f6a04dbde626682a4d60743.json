  "description": "This circular walk around the Howth Peninsula follows the purple waymarked 'Bog of Frogs' route along the cliff tops before climbing to the wonderful viewpoints above the coast. The route runs for just ove 6 miles with fairly easy coastal walking before a more challenging inland ascents. The walk starts from Howth Train Station which is only about a 20 minute train ride from Dublin. You then head east to the Nose of Howth before turning south to Piper's Gut and the picturesque Baily Lighthouse. The route then bends round to the west, passing Doldrum Bay before coming to Red Rock. Here you pick up the inland section to climb to Shielmartin Hill which stands at a height of 163 metres (535 ft). There's great views over Portmarnock, Sutton, Bull Island and most of Dublin Bay from here. You continue to the 171 m (561 ft) high Ben of Howth where you will find a Radio Mast and some wonderful views across the headland. The route then descends past the Deer Park golf club before returning to Howth village. For a less challenging route you can try the Howth Cliff Walk which starts from Sutton Train station and stays on the flatter coastal paths. To continue your walking in the city head south west from the city centre to visit Tymon Park. There's a number of nice waymarked woodland trails and waterside paths along the River Poddle here.",

There's nice beaches, island views, a pier and seals to look out for in the harbour of this attractive area. Near here there's also Balbriggan where you can visit the historic Ardgillan Castle. The 18th century country house is surrounded by a splendid 200-acre public park with beautiful gardens, sea views and miles of fine walking trails to try."
