The harbour branch was opened in 1914 to increase freight on the 3ft line. However with the collapse of the fishing industry the plan failed. Plus the growth of road transport meant a more convenient means of getting fish to market. The railway closed for good in 1929 after 50 years of operation. The remains are directly opposite the sailing club"

  "description": "This lovely circular walk takes you from the coastal town of Southwold to the nearby village of Walberswick in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths\u00a0Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There's much to enjoy in this area with coastal views, pretty beaches and riverside paths along the River Blyth. The walk starts by the pier in the popular town of Southwold. The pier is 90 metres (620\u00a0ft) long with an adjacent model boat pond. From the pier you follow the Suffolk Coast Path south towards the River Blyth, passing the sand and shingle beach and the Grade II listed lighthouse. You can catch a ferry over the river but this walks follows the river path towards Woodsend Marshes before crossing the bridge and heading to Walberswick. Here you have the option of continuing along the Dunwich River to Dunwich Forest and the lovely Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve . The area around the village makes up the\u00a0Suffolk Coast National Nature Reserve, a protected area of 1,340 hectares (3,300 acres) with a range of wetland and heathland habitats. Consequently the area is great for birdwatching with March Harrier, Bearded Tit, Water Rail and Bittern to look out for. After exploring the village and enjoying refreshments at one of the pubs or cafes you follow the river back to Woodsend Marshes where there is a nice footpath to follow through Busscreek Marshes. You then follow the Buss Creek back to the pier and the finish point. The Sandlings Walk long distance footpath starts in Southwold so you could pick this up to extend your walking in the area. It takes you through the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty from the town to Ipswich . Also nearby is Minsmere Nature Reserve and Dunwich Heath which are great for peaceful walks and wildlife. You could also try the Kessingland to Southwold Walk which runs along the coast path, passing the village of Covehithe with its interesting ruined church.",
