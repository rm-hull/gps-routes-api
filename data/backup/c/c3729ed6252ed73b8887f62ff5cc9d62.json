  "description": "This cycle or walk explores the lovely Garw Valley near Bridgend in South Wales. The route follows a disused railway line from Bryngarw Country Park to Blaengarw at the head of the valley. There's fine views of the River Garw as you pass Pontycymer to the east and the Garw Forest to the west. The trail runs for just under 6 miles, rising steadily from the park to the finish point at Blaengarw. The area is good for wildlife spotting and also played a sigfnificant role in its mining history. You can extend your exercise by exploring the 120 acre Bryngarw Country Park where there are ponds, woodland trails and wildflower meadows to enjoy.",
