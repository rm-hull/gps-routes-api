  "description": "This Yorkshire based village is in a great spot for exploring the famous Ilkley Moor and the beautiful Wharfedale. The attractive settlement is also a nice place for a stroll with a picturesque village green and several historic buildings to see. It also has a train station on the Wharfedale Line, with direct trains to Leeds, Bradford and Ilkley. This walk takes you to some of the walking highlights of the area including Otley Chevin Country Park and the Cow and Calf on nearby Ilkley Moor . The walk starts from the train station and heads south west along Hag Farm Road to meet up with the Dales Way and the Ebor Way at Hag Farm. You can follow this waymarked trail south east to Menston before climbing up to The Chevin. It's a popular viewpoint with marvellous views over the surrounding area. The route then retraces its steps to Burley Woodhead where you can follow the same waymarked paths onto Ilkley Moor and visit the popular Cow and Calf. Here you'll find  a large rock formation consisting of an outcrop and boulder, also known as Hangingstone Rocks.  The area also includes the Twelve Apostles stone circle which dates from the Bronze Age. From the Cow and Calf you can pick up a bridleway path and follow it north east back to Burley in Wharfedale.",
