  "description": "This is a popular coastal walk between the Devon villages of Branscombe and Beer. It takes you along the South West Coast Path with fantastic cliff tops views. Highlights on the walk include a visit to the National Trust's Manor Mill, the only remaining working mill in Branscombe. You'll also pass the stunning Hooken Cliffs, a Jurassic Coast UNESCO World Heritage Site. A slump in the Chalk cliffs in 1790 separated a 10-acre tract of land, now a wooded and sheltered habitat with chalk pinnacles on the seaward side. It's reached via a steep footpath leading from the clifftop to Branscombe Beach. The thick vegetation in the area is also a haven for wildlife. The walk starts at the car park in Branscombe, where there is a splendid old thatched forge where you can watch blacksmiths at work. There's also and old bakery which now serves as a tea room. After leaving the village you pass Manor Mill and head towards Branscombe Mouth on the coast. Here you pick up the coast path to take you past Hooken Beach and Hooken Cliffs, before arriving at Beer Head. Here you turn north past Pound's Pool, Arrat's Hil and Big Ledge. The route finishes in the pretty seaside village of Beer, where there are lovely views over Seaton Bay and Lyme Bay with a nice shingle beach and lots of fishing boats. Apart from a steep section at the start, the walk is fairly flat and takes place on good paths. It's about a 3 mile walk, so 6 miles there and back. To extend your walking in the area you can continue along the coast path to Seaton where you can pick up the Lyme Regis to Seaton Undercliff Walk. This will take you along the coast from Devon into Dorset. If you enjoy wildlife you can head to the nearby Seaton Marshes where there is a splendid tramway walk with lots of wildlife to look out for. Heading west takes you along the coast to Sidmouth on the Sidmouth to Beer Walk. It's a splendid undulating section of the path with Exmoor Ponies and more interesting geological features.",
