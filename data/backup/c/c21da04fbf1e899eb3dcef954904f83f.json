  "description": "This riverside walk takes you along the River Suir in the town of Thurles in County Tipperary. The walk starts in Thurles Town Park, just to the south of the historic cathedral. There's riverside trails in the park and a footbridge to cross to the other side. You can then follow another footpath south on the western side of the river. A little further south there's the confluence of the Suir and the River Drish where there is another pleasant trail. To continue your walking around the town head into the Silvermine Mountains to the northwest and the Slieveardagh Hills to the southeast. In the Silvermine Mountains you could try the climb to Keeper Hill from some wonderful views over the area.",

You can also pick up the Nore Valley Walk and enjoy a walk along the River Nore to Bennettsbridge here. To the south is Cahir Castle. The 12th century castle is well worth a visit with lovely grounds and a fascinating history. Near here there's also the Rock Of Cashel. The ancient site houses Ireland's most remarkable collection of medieval structures. In Cashel you can also visit the photogenic ruins of Hore Abbey which lies just to the west of the Rock."
