  "description": "This circular walk from Hammersmith takes you along the River Thames Path, visiting local highlights including Chiswick House, Barnes Common, the London Wetland Centre and the Beverley Brook Walk. The walk starts at Hammersmith Bridge where you can pick up the Thames Path and follow the waymarked footpath west along the river to Chiswick. Here you can take a short detour from the path to visit Chiswick House where you'll find 65 acres of beautiful gardens surrounding a fine neo-Palladian villa. The route then returns to the river and follows the path towards Barnes where you cross the water on Barnes Bridge. You then pick up a section of the Beverley Brook Walk and follow it east across Barnes Common to return to the river near Fulham. Here you can see Craven Cottage and Fulham Palace on the other side of the water. The route continues north along the river towards the London Wetland Centre. The reserve is a great place for spotting a variety of wildfowl and waders on the reserve's pretty lakes. From here it is a short walk north to return to Hammersmith Bridge where the route finishes.",
