  "description": "This walk takes you up to Wether Fell and Drumaldrace Hill in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The route starts and finishes in Bainbridge but you could also start from the village of Burtersett as the route passes through the settlement. From Bainbridge you can follow the Cam High Road all the way to the fell. The old Roman Road will take you south west across Bainbridge High Pasture, passing Horton Gill Force Waterfall on the way. At Wether Fell there is a circular bridle track running around the fell to Drumaldrace and Wether Fell Side. You'll reach a high point of 614 metres (2,014 ft) with wonderful views over the area.",
