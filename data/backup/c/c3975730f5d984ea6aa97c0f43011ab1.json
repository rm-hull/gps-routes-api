During the dissolution of the monasteries Richard Pollard acquired the property and later in 1649 it was bought by Edmund Prideaux, Attorney General to Cromwell. He converted the building and made it into a house. It is still in private ownership and open to the public. Today there was a wedding and one can just about see the guests enjoying the sunshine on the lawn outside the house."

The river falls over 200 metres from its source."

  "description": "Follow in the footsteps of the villagers that made their way to join the Protestant Monmouth Rebellion in 1685. The route starts at Ham Hill Country Park where you will find splendid views of the Mendip Hills, Blackdown Hills, Quantock Hills and Dorset Downs. From here you head south through West Chinnock, Haselbury Plucknett, Misterton and Wayford Woods before coming to Forde Abbey . This former Cistercian monastery has 30 acres of award winning gardens and is well worth a look. Also of interest is Cricket St Thomas - it's just to the north of the trail and has 160 acres of parkland and gardens to explore. The route continues towards Thorncombe and then onto Fishpond Bottom via Lambert's Castle Iron Age hill fort. The final stretch takes you past Wooton Fitzpaine and then along the River Lim to Lyme Regis on the coast.",
