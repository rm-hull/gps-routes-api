After having purchased the Hall in the mid-18th century by the 1st Lord Walpole, the gardens were established with battlemented walls and yew hedges."

Thousands of roses were planted in date order, creating small separate gardens, each with a design typical of its period. The rose gardens were opened in 1984 by Dr Max Walters, past director of Cambridge Botanic Gardens."

  "description": "This circular walk visits Mannington Hall and Gardens near Itteringham in Norfolk. The extensive grounds of this fine country house are a lovely place for a stroll with parkland, woodland, lakes, a ruined chapel, a moat and beautiful gardens to explore. This circular walk from the house uses a section of the Holt-Mannington Walk to explore the surrounding countryside. The waymarked trail is a good way to further stretch your legs through this lovely part of the world. You can start the walk from the car park and visitor centre at the hall. After exploring the estate pick up the trail and head south west to Mossymere Woods. You then head north through the countryside towards Barningham Green before turning south east to return to the hall. To continue your walking in the area head south east to visit the nearby Blickling Hall where you'll find five thousand acres of parkland, farmland and woodland to explore on foot or by bike. The popular Weavers' Way long distance walk can also be picked up here. Just to the east is the 18th century Wolterton Hall Estate. A visit to this area can be combined with this walk to take in two local historic estates in one go.",
