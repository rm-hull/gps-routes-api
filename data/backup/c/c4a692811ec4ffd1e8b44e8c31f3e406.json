  "description": "This worthy North Yorkshire village sits in a lovely spot at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and River Nidd. The picturesque village includes a village green, duck pond, pretty cottages, riverside trails and the impressive 17th century Nun Monkton Priory. The priory stands on the site of an ancient nunnery. The village is located on the opposite side of the river to Beningbrough Hall. The 18th century house is one of the highlights of the area with some beautiful gardens to explore. The Jorvic Way can also be picked up just to the south at neighbouring Moor Monkton. The long distance trail is a good way to explore the surrounding countryside.",
