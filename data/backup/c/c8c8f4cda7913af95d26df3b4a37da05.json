This looks across the latter, which can be seen running left to right, towards Beddingham and Itford Hills (Left and right respectively). The main A27 can also be seen running across the picture as well as its junction with the A26 at the small village of Beddingham. Caburn's etymology derives from Calde Burgh or cold fort which lived up to its name with the wind whipping in from the coast."

  "description": "This popular circular walk on the South Downs takes you from the village of Glynde to the town of Lewes. On the way you'll pass Mount Caburn where there are excellent views over the area. The route runs for a distance of just over 6 miles with some moderate climbs on the way. The walk starts from the pretty village of Glynde located two miles (5 km) east of Lewes. You could start from Glynde railway station which is reachable from Lewes. There's also a public car park near the train station as well. From the village you can pick up a public footapth heading west toward Mount Caburn. This area is also a designated nature reserve consisting of managed chalk downland and a Bronze Age hill fort. There is a wide variety of flora and fauna to look out for too. At the summit of the 480-feet (146m) high hill you'll find the fort and a splendid view point with far reaching views across the South Downs. After taking in the views you descend the hill and continue west toward Lewes with views of the River Ouse. You then turn east, following another footpath past the golf course and Saxon Down. The final section turns south to take you back to the village via Glynde Place. This interesting Elizabethan Manor House is the family home of the Viscounts Hampden, whose forebears built the house in 1569. It is a Grade I listed building while the adjacent church was built in the eighteenth century. The house and gardens are open to the public for tours in the spring and early summer.",
