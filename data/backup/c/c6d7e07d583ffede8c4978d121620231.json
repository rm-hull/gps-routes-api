  "description": "Letchworth Garden City is located in Hertfordshire near to Hitchin and Stevenage. Walking highlights include the epic Icknield Way Path, the nearby Chiltern Hills, Norton Common and river paths along the River Oughton near the town. This circular walk from the town uses a section of the Icknield Way Path to visit the nearby villages of Ickleford and Pirton . The walk starts at the train station and then heads north to skirt the edge of Norton Common. The common is a local nature reserve with woodland and a nature reserve. You can take a detour from the route to further explore the footpaths on the common. The route then heads west through the town along the Icknield Way to Ickleford. This pretty village has a nice village green with views of the River Hiz which passes through the area. Just after passing through the village you could turn south to visit the Oughtonhead Common Nature reserve. There's trails here along the River Oughton with lots of wildlife to look out for. The walk continues west along Westmill Lane before turning north west to visit the village of Pirton. The little village has lots of pretty old cottages and an interesting old church, rebuilt in 1877, but with the remains of its 12th-century tower. After exploring the village you turn east to follow Hambridge Lane into the countryside towards Ickleford. You then turn north east to follow an alternative path through Cadwell before returning to Letchworth on bridle tracks.",
