They offer good quality, if short, rock climbs. The rocks are just off the High Peak Trail and there are no access problems. Daniel Defoe came here on his 'Tour through Great Britain' in the early 18th century and described a family living in Harboro Cave - a natural cavern in the edge which has been excavated by archaeologists who have found evidence of occupation from the Ice Age onwards."

  "description": "This attractive Derbyshire Dales village is close to a number of popular waymarked trails and a major local reservoir. The historic settlement includes several centuries old limestone cottages, a church dating from the Norman period and a notable Tudor house built in 1615. The Peak District is also not far away. This circular walk from the village takes you to some of the local walking highlights including the splendid viewpoint at Middleton Top and the expansive Carsington Water . The walk starts in the village and heads north to Longcliffe Dale Farm where you can pick up the Limestone Way and follow the waymarked footpath to a junction where 4 trails cross. At this point you can pick up the Midshires Way , High Peak Trail and the Pennine Bridleway and follow the trails east past Harboro Rocks to Middleton Top near Wirksworth . The route then heads south west, following a footpath to Hopton and Carsington village. Continue south and you'll soon pick up a lakeside trail which will take you to the visitor centre at the site. The route then leaves the lake, heading west to Knockerdown before following Brackendale Lane to Bradbourne. Here you turn north to follow another country lane back to Brassington.",
