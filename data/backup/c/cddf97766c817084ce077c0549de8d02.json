  "description": "This market town is located in the Staffordshire Moorlands area of the county. It's proximity to the scenic Churnet Valley and the Peak District National Park make it a fine base for walkers. This walk from the town heads east to explore the aforementioned Churnet Valley. You'll visit the Hawksmoor Nature Reserve, the beautiful Dimmingsdale and the village of Oakamoor on the way. Start the walk on the eastern side of the town where you can pick up footpaths heading east through the countryside to the Hawksmoor Nature Reserve. This National Trust owned reserve has ancient woodland, wildflowers and wildlife including spot green woodpeckers, spotted flycatchers and ravens.  Here you can pick up the Staffordshire Way and follow it south east into Dimmingsdale. This is another peaceful area of woodland which includes a series of picturesque ponds. The route then crosses the river near Alton, close to the famous Alton Towers theme park. You then follow a trail along a dismantled railway north west to the village of Oakamoor. Country lanes then lead you west to Stoney Dale before returning to Hawksmoor and following the same paths back to Cheadle.",
