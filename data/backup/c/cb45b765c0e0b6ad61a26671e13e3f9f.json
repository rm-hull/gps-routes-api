  "description": "This walk takes you to the lovely Bassenthwaite Lake from Keswick in the Lake District. It makes use of the Allerdale Ramble so the path is generally well defined and way-marked. You start off in the popular town of Keswick and soon pick up the River Derwent where you can enjoy a long riverside section to Thornthwaite Forest. You then follow peaceful woodland trails through Dodd Wood before another waterside section along Bassenthwaite Lake. You return through the forest and then on to Applethwaite and Milbeck before returning to Keswick. There are fabulous views of Skiddaw to enjoy all along the walk. In Dodd Wood you can visit Dodd Fell summit and look out for the Bassenthwaite Ospreys from the viewpoints. The lake is located on the edge of the expansive Whinlatter Forest Park where you can extend your exercise on one of the many cycling and walking trails.",
