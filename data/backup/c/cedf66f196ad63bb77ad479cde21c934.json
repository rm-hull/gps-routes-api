There has probably been a crossing point over the River Teign here since time immemorial as it is on the route that links Moretonhampstead with Drewsteignton and the north side of the river. The old narrow packhorse bridge with its triangular refuges has certainly been in existence since the 17th century. This is the upstream face viewed looking downstream with the roof of The Fingle Bridge Inn just visible over the top of the bridge parapet."

  "description": "This small Devon town is often described as the gateway to the Dartmoor National Park making it a fine place to start a walk. The market town also houses a number of historic buildings including the old Alms Houses and the Parish Church of St Andrew, which dates back to the 15th century. This walk from the town visits some of the area highlights including Fingle Bridge , Castle Drogo and Cranbrook Castle. The walk starts in the town centre and follows the Dartmoor Way north to Butterdown Down and Cranbrook where you can branch off to the right to climb Cranbrook Castle hillfort. The route continues north through Charles Wood to the iconic Fingle Bridge. This old packhorse bridge dates back to the 16th/17th century and is Grade II listed. From here you head north towards Prestonbury Castle before turning west to Piddledown Common and the splendid Castle Drogo. This National Trust run area includes fine parkland and gardens to explore. You then pick up a riverside path heading east along the River Teign through Hannicombe Wood. The route then retraces its steps to return to the village.",
