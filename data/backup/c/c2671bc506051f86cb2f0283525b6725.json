In 1897 this Celtic cross was erected to Tennyson's memory. The inscription on the far side reads: \"IN MEMORY OF ALFRED LORD TENNYSON THIS CROSS IS RAISED A BEACON TO SAILORS BY THE PEOPLE OF FRESHWATER & OTHER FRIENDS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA\" It is situated on the highest point of the downs, nearly 150 metres above sea level."

  "description": "A circular walk to Tennyson Down and the Tennyson Mounment on the Isle of Wight Coast. The circular walk also visits The Needles which are just up the coast from the monument. It's a bracing walk with excellent views over the Solent from the cliff tops. Start the walk from the National Trust car park at Totland Bay with a postcode of PO39 0HY for your sat navs. From here you can pick up a footpath heading south up to the Tennyson Monument. This is dedicated to the famous poet that once lived in nearby Freshwater Bay. He was the Poet Laureate during much of Queen Victoria's reign and wrote the famous poem \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\". The route then picks up the Tennyson Trail and Isle of Wight Coast Path and heads west past the Highdown Cliffs and West High Down to visit the Needles. There's fine views of the famous sea stacks and the interesting old batteries to enjoy here. After enjoying the Needles the route then heads east along alternative footpaths to take you back to the car park.",
