  "description": "Explore beautiful Eskdale and enjoy waterside paths along the rushing River Esk on this varied route. Along the way there's lots of waterfalls, beautiful Lakeland scenery and fabulous views from the high points. Eskdale is one of the quieter areas of the Lake District so expect a peaceful and beautiful valley walk. You can start the walk from Dalegarth where there is a car park and a train station on the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway. From here you can pick up the footpaths along the river passing Gill Force waterfall. The walk takes you along the river to Brotherikeld before climbing to Cam Spout Crag, close to Scafell Pike. You then follow a splendid elevated path to Silverybield Crag before descending to Scale Gill. The route then finishes by following the river back to Dalegarth. There's lots of other great walks in the Eskdale area to try. You could enjoy a climb to Muncaster Fell just to the west of Dalegarth. It's another great ridge walk with fine views over the Cumbrian Coast around Ravenglass. You can visit Eskdale from the town by following our Ravenglass to Eskdale Walk which crosses the fell. Near Brotherikeld you can climb to Harter Fell and enjoy woodland trails through Dunnerdale Forest. Also nearby is Devoke Water, the largest tarn in the Lake District. In Upper Eskdale you can climb to Scafell Pike, the highest mountain in England.",
