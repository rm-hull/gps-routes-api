  "description": "Follow the River Chess through the Chess Valley on this delightful trail through Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. The popular route runs for a duration of just under 10 miles along a fairly flat, waymarked footpath. You start at Chesham Station passing Latimer, Chenies and Loudwater before finishing at Rickmansworth Station. This is a nice easy waterside walk with plenty of attractive countryside and a series of quiet little villages to enjoy. It is also easily accessible with train stations at either end. Route highlights include the Grade I listed Chenies Manor House with its beautiful gardens and the splendid grounds of the Chorleywood House Estate near Loudwater. At Latimer you will also pass the impressive Latimer House, a red brick Tudor style mansion, which was designed by Edward Blore, and completed in 1838. The walk links with the long distance Chiltern Heritage Trail around Chenies so it's easy to extend your walk on this path. For a shorter walk you could try our route from Chesham which runs to Latimer before turning south to finish at the village of Little Chalfont . Here you can catch a train from Chalfont and Latimer station to take you back to Chesham.",
