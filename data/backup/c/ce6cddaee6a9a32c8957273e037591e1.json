  "description": "Travel through the River Lark Valley on this interesting and varied walk from Mildenhall to Bury St Edmunds via West Stow Country Park. The easy trail runs for about 13 miles with some fine views of the Suffolk countryside along the way. The path starts at Mildenhall and soon joins the river Lark, following it through the Cavenham Heath Nature Reserve to Icklingham. You continue through the delightful West Stow Country Park with its lakes, wildfowl reserve and interesting reconstructed Anglo saxon village. The park also includes the wildlife rich Lackford Lakes where you can look our for an abundance of water loving birds. The final section continues along the river through Culford to Bury St Edmunds where you finish by the train station. At the end of the walk you can enjoy a stroll through the Bury St Edmunds Abbey Gardens. The river runs through the 14-acre gardens which are built on the site of the former Benedictine Abbey.",
