  "description": "Explore the West Walk section of the Forest of Bere on this woodland route near Portsmouth. There's waymarked walking trails and other paths suitable for cycling. For example you can try the Forest of Bere Trail which follows waymarked woodland paths to the ponds where you can look out for lots of wildlife. In the spring months you can also see the pretty bluebells. You can extend your exercise by heading east to Creech Woods near Denmead where there are more walking trails to try in the forest. The forest also includes Havant Thicket where you can visit the ponds and look out for deer. The Meon Valley Trail runs past the western edge of the woods so is easy to pick up. The shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway track from West Meon to Meonstoke and Wickham, with great views of the River Meon.",
