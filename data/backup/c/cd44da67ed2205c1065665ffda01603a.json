  "description": "Explore the West Walk section of the Forest of Bere on this woodland route near Portsmouth. There's waymarked walking trails and other paths suitable for cycling. For example you can try the Forest of Bere Trail which follows waymarked woodland paths to the ponds where you can look out for lots of wildlife. In the spring months you can also see the pretty bluebells. You can extend your exercise by heading east to Creech Woods near Denmead where there are more walking trails to try in the forest. The forest also includes Havant Thicket where you can visit the ponds and look out for deer. The Meon Valley Trail runs past the western edge of the woods so is easy to pick up. The shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway track from West Meon to Meonstoke and Wickham, with great views of the River Meon.",

It has some history having originally been \u201cThe Old Curio Shop\u201d, an open hall timber framed building dating back to the sixteenth Century. Inside there are medieval paintings with floral/geometric patterns preserved behind glass and still on display. They do lovely home cooked food which you can enjoy in the pretty garden area if the weather is fine. You can find the pub on Wickham Square with a postcode of PO17 5JN for your sat navs."

      "content": "The Wickham Railway Walk can be picked up in the village just to the west of the woods. It uses a section of the Meon Valley Trail and the waymarked King's Way to create a circular walk around the village. The walk first follows the old railway line along the River Meon before heading to the countryside and woodland of the Creech Woods section of the Forest of Bere. It's a nice varied walk and a good way to explore the surrounding area. For more walking ideas in the area see the South Downs Walks page."
