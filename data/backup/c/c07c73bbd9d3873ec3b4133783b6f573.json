    "description": "This large open space in Banstead has lots of walking trails to follow. There's also bridleways which are suitable for cyclists. Part of the Banstead Commons the heath covers 760 acres with miles of paths popular with dog walkers and cyclists. It's a very pretty area with meadow grasses, wildflowers, woodland and mixed heather. It's great for wildlife too with Linnet, Yellowhammers, Redpoll, Reed Bunting and a variety of butterflies to look out for. The Epsom Downs circular walk skirts the heath so you could pick this up to extend your walk. Also nearby are Banstead Downs and Banstead Woods .",
