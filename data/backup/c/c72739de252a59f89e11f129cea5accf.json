  "description": "This Hampshire market town is located close to the woodland trails of the New Forest and the coastal paths on the south coast. To the south you can visit the coastal village of Barton on Sea where you can enjoy some lovely cliff top walks and views of the Isle of Wight. The Solent Way can be picked up to the east while the Bournemouth Coast Path can be accessed around Highcliffe Castle to the west. Just to the north you can explore the New Forest on Wilverley Plain. The plain is a popular place for picnics in the warmer months. This walk in the town visits the Ballard Water Meadows. The park is located just north of the town and includes pleasant footpaths around Ballard Lake, a pretty brook and some woodland. It's a nice peaceful place for a stroll and is just a short walk from the train station.",
