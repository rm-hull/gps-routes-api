  "description": "This circular walk explores the Fetteresso Forest in Aberdeenshire. You'll follow peaceful woodland trails to Cowie Water and the attractive Haugh Head where there are some lovely countryside views. Look out for wildlife such as Deer, foxes and birds of prey as you make your way along the tranquil paths. In addition to the walking trails the forest has miles of wide tracks suitable for mountain biking. To the east there's also Maryculter Woods where you can enjoy some lovely views of the Crynoch Burn. To the north is Durris Forest and the climb to the viewpoint at Cairn-mon-earn.",
