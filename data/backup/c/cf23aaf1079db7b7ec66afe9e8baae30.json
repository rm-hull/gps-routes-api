  "description": "This walk in Ashburton takes you along the River Ashburn to some of the local woods to the north of the small town. There's a nice riverside footpath along the slender river, with lovely views of the surrounding Devon countryside. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the Dartmoor Way long distance trail. Follow it north and it will take you along the river, passing Woodencliff Wood on the way. You can then return on the same paths. Back in the town there are a number of nice pubs where you can enjoy refreshments. Also take time to visit the noteworthy church of St Andrew which is a fine building of the 15th century with a tall tower and two aisles. To continue your walking around Ashburton head south on the Dartmoor Way to visit Buckfastleigh and Buckfast Abbey . At the abbey you can enjoy a peaceful stroll through the Lavender garden, Physic garden and Sensory garden. The abbey is also the start point for the Abbot's Way long distance trail which will take you through the Dartmoor National Park to the ruins of Tavistock Abbey 22 miles to the west. Just to the west of the town there's some nice trails to try through Hembury Woods . The site includes Hembury Castle Iron Age Hillfort and a series of shady woodland trails.",
