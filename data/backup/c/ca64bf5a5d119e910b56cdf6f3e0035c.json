The area has been mined for coal for at least 700 years. Within a couple of miles of here over 200 shafts have been sunk. Colliers Wood and the surrounding area was once Moorgreen Colliery, opened by Barber, Walker & Co in 1865. Coal production from the three shafts began in 1871. At its peak the colliery produced over a million tons of coal in 1963. From that point, production gradually decreased and the pit eventually closed in 1985 when the seams were exhausted. Following landscaping, the land was converted into an industrial estate and the country park."

  "description": "This short walk visits Colliers Wood Nature Reserve before following footpaths to the nearby Moorgreen Reservoir. The walk starts in the Colliers Wood car park just to the south of the reservoir. Here you can follow footpaths around the reserve's pond and woodland. It's a small reserve but very pretty, with lots of interesting flora and fauna. The large pond is a lovely place to have a picnic and look out for wildlife. After exploring the surfaced paths of the reserve you then pick up the Broxtowe Country Way and follow it north along the B600 to the reservoir. Here you can follow more woodland trails through High Park Wood along the eastern side of the water before returning on the same path. To extend your walk head east into the extensive woodland next to the reservoir. There's miles of tracks taking you into Morning Springs Wood near Beauvale village. The long distance Robin Hood Way runs just to the south east of the reserve. If you pick this up and head east you can visit the pretty Mill Lakes in Bestwood Country Park . The circular Hucknall Walk starts from the train station in the nearby market town. It visits the reservoir and Bestwood Park while exploring some of the local countryside on waymarked footpaths. It's a good way of visiting the site by public transport while enjoying more of the local scenery.",
