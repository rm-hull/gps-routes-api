  "description": "This epic long distance path links Boston in Lincolnshire to Abbotsbury in Dorset. It is promoted to raise money for the charity Macmillan Cancer Relief . The route starts from Boston and then runs across the Fens to Bourne before joining the limestone belt. You then head to Stamford and then along the shoreline of Rutland Water . You'll also pass through the medieval market town of Oakham where there's some wonderful old architecture at the Norman castle and the 16th century Oakham School. The trail then heads south and west via Warmington to Stow-on-the-Wold , then into the Cotswolds via Cirencester and Tetbury to Bradford-on-Avon. After leaving the Cotswolds you follow the path through Somerset passing Castle Cary before entering Dorset and the final section to Abbotsbury via Sherborne. The route joins with other popular trails including the Viking Way at Oakham, the Thames Path National Trail near Thames Head and with the South West Coast Path towards the end of the route. The Macmillan Way is well waymarked with a green and white disc.",
