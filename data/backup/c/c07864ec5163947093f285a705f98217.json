The hill has no officially numbered rights of way across it, but is nonetheless crossed by the Dartmoor Way and the Taw-Teign Link, which appear to share the path I was following when I took this. Seen in late sunlight."

  "description": "This attractive Devon based village is located in the Dartmoor National Park next to the village of Sticklepath . This circular walk from South Zeal takes you to the viewpoint on Ramsley Hill before exploring the heathland on the slopes of Cosdon Hill to the west of the settlement. From the high points there are some splendid views over the surrounding hills and countryside. To continue your walking in the area head into Sticklepath where there are nice views of the River Taw and the National Trust's Finch Foundry . The 19th-century water-powered\u00a0forge includes a water wheel and demonstrations of the historic\u00a0tilt hammer,\u00a0drop hammer, and shear hammer tools.",
