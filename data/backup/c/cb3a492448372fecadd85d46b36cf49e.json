  "description": "This walk visits the impressive Cefn Coed Viaduct in the village of Cefn-coed-y-cymmer in Merthyr Tydfil. There is a shared cycling and walking trail running over the viaduct along part of the popular Taff Trail. You can pick up the trail near the High Street in Cefn-coed-y-cymmer. Then head south, crossing the viaduct and the river. The structure spans the Taf Fawr river and was constructed as part of the Merthyr- Pontsticill junction railway line. It dates back to the mid 19th century and is the third largest in Wales. From the top there are some excellent views over the town to the surrounding hills and mountains.",
