  "description": "This Peak District walk climbs to the highest point in Greater Manchester at Black Chew Head. The hill stands at a height of 542 m (1,778 ft) providing excellent views over the area. You can start the walk from the car park at Crowden on the northern side of Torside Reservoir. From here you can pick up the Pennine Way and follow the waymarked trail north to Laddow Rocks where there's some wonderful geology and breathtaking views. From the rocks you continue north west to the Black Chew Head Summit where there's fine views over the surrounding moorland into the High Peak area of Derbyshire. Near Laddow Rocks you have the option of heading west to visit Chew Reservoir where there are some nice waterside trails. You could also continue north along the Pennine Way to the 583 metre high Black Hill, the highest point of the historic county of Cheshire.",
