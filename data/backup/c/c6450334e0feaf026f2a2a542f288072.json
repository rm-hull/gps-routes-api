  "description": "This walk visits Napton Reservoir near the village of Napton on the Hill in Warwickshire. The lake is a good place for fishing and an easy stroll. There's a car park on the western side of the water where you can pick up footpaths running along the lake. Follow the paths north and they will take you to Calcutt Marina and lock on the Grand Union Canal . You can extend your walk by heading south and picking up the Oxford Canal Walk .",
