Runcorn is perched at the northerly end of an outcrop of sandstone which overlooks the River Mersey, a reminder that deserts covered this area 250 million years ago. A series of red sandstone quarries dating back to 1734 litter the hill. This one was known as \"Frog's mouth\" and is popular with climbers. Extraction from this quarry ceased around 1850 and it was then gradually filled with the spoil of the newer quarries. The present level of the ground is about one third of the depth when it was a working quarry."

  "description": "This port town in Cheshire is located next to the Mersey Estuary in Halton. There's lots of good waterside walking along the canals and river which run through the area around the town. This circular walk in the town explores Runcorn Hill where there are some fine views towards the Mersey Estuary. The hill is located just to the south of the train station and includes a car park as well. The site was originally a sandstone quarry but has now been converted into a local nature reserve with woodland, sandstone quarry clifs, heathland and parkland trails. There's good facilties with a visitor centre and cafe for refreshment. Just north east of the park you can continue your walking in the town on Wigg Island . This park and nature reserve sits in an interesting location, between the\u00a0River Mersey\u00a0and the Manchester Ship Canal .",
