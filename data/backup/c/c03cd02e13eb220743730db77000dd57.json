  "description": "This small village sits in a remote spot high in the centre of Exmoor. It's a popular place to start a walk with a car park, a fine local pub and a number of waymarked trails branching off onto Exmoor Forest. This circular walk from the village uses a sections of the Two Moors Way and the Tarka Trail to explore the surrounding area. On the way there are pleasant riverside stretches along the River Barle and River Exe, as well as some excellent views from the high points. You can start the walk from the public car park in the village. From here you can pick up the long distance waymarked footpath and follow it south east along the River Barle to Flexbarrow and Cow Castle Hill fort. The elevated fort sits at a height of 332 metres, commanding fine views over the moors. The route continues to Great Fernby Ball where you turn west to Burcombe and Great Cornham. You continue north to Tangs Bottom and Exe Head where you turn east to Dure Down and Great Ashcombe. The final section then leads south through Ashcombe Bottom and the woodland of the Ashcombe Plantation before returning to the car park at Simonsbath.",
