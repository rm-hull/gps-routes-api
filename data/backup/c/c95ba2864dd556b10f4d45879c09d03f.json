  "description": "A circular walk from Looe visiting Talland Bay before returning to the town through inland country lanes. It's a varied walk with riverside paths, woodland trails, coastal sections and some hill climbs. The route is just under 7 miles with moderate climbs through the countryside after a fairly easy coastal section. The walk starts from West Looe, close to the train station. You head south along the Looe River to the coast at Hannafore before passing along Portnadler Bay. Here you can enjoy lovely views over to Looe Island . The island is a great place for wildlife lovers with grey seals, cormorants, shags and oystercatchers to look out for. The walk continues to Talland where you will pass the noteworthy St Tallanus' Church. The Grade I listed church dates from the 13th century and is positioned in a dramatic cliff top location. Shortly after you come to Talland Bay where you'll find two sheltered shingle beaches, Talland Sand and Rotterdam Beach. It's a lovely, unspoiled place and is both a designated Area of Outstanding Beauty and a Heritage Coast. After enjoying the bay the route then turns inland to follow footpaths and quiet lanes through the countryside to Tencreek, Parkers Cross and Kilminorth. Here you pass through the Kilminorth Woods nature reserve before picking up a riverside path to take you back into West Looe. You can continue your walking along the South West Coast Path on the Looe to Polperro Walk .",
