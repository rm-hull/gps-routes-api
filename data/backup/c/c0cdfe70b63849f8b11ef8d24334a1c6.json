  "description": "This walk explores the woodland at Firestone Copse near Ryde on the Isle of Wight. The woods are located just to the south west of Ryde, near Fishbourne and Wootton Bridge. There are a series of walking trails to follow around the woods where tree species include Oak, Ash and coniferous Douglas, Cedar and Scots Pine. You can start the walk from the good sized car parking area on the Firestone Copse Road. On the way look out for various wildflowers and wildlife including several woodland birds. On the western side of the woods there's also the picturesque Wootton Bridge Old Mill Pond to see. Head north and you could extend your walking at Quarr Abbey. There's nice footpaths to follow around the attractive estate of the 12th century ruined monastery.",

If you prefer a pub lunch then head a short distance south to Havenstreet where you can visit the White Hart. The attractive pub serves good quality dishes and has a lovely garden area to sit in on warmer days. You can find them at postcode PO33 4DP for your sat navs. The pub is also conveniently placed for the Isle of Wight Heritage Steam Railway train centre at Havenstreet Station, where the old trains make their way to join the electrified Ryde-Shanklin line at Smallbrook. The quaint station has been carefully restored to reflect a 1940s British Railways (Southern) style station. There is also a nice cafe and exhibits here. The station is located just a mile south of the woods at postcode PO33 4DS."
