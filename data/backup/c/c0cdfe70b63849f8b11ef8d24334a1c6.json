  "description": "This walk explores the woodland at Firestone Copse near Ryde on the Isle of Wight. The woods are located just to the south west of Ryde, near Fishbourne and Wootton Bridge. There are a series of walking trails to follow around the woods where tree species include Oak, Ash and coniferous Douglas, Cedar and Scots Pine.  You can start the walk from the good sized car parking area on the Firestone Copse Road. On the way look out for various wildflowers and wildlife including several woodland birds. On the western side of the woods there's also the picturesque Wootton Bridge Old Mill Pond to see. Head north and you could extend your walking at Quarr Abbey . There's nice footpaths to follow around the attractive estate of the 12th century ruined monastery.",
