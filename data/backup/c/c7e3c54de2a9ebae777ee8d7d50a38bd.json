  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the network of accessible paths by the beautiful Wyre Estuary in this waterside country park near Blackpool. There are also peaceful woodland paths and bird hides where you can view a variety of wildlife. The park has a visitor centre, cafe and picnic areas. This 3 mile circular walk starts at the car park and takes you south along the river towards Little Thornton before returning on an alternative country lane. The long distance Wyre Way passes the park so you can pick this up to extend your walk. You could follow the trail along the river and then west to reach the coast around Cleveleys and Fleetwood.",
