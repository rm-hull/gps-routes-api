  "description": "This small village is located just east of Bridport in the county of Dorset. The pretty settlement is surrounded by some lovely rolling countryside and is close to the wonderful Jurassic Coast at Burton Bradstock. There's also a historic 15th century church, picturesque thatched cottages and a fine local pub for refreshments after your walk. This circular walk from the village takes you up to Shipton Hill. The hill stands at a height of 170 metres and lies just to the north east of the village. You can follow a mixture of quiet country lanes and public footpaths up to the hill summit where you'll find a trig point and some pleasant views over the surrounding countryside.",
