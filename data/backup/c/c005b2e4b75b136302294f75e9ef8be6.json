  "description": "This walk visits the Loch of Aboyne\u00a0in\u00a0Grampian. The picturesque loch has some nice footpaths running alongside it with views across the water to the surrounding hills and mountains. The loch is also good for wildlife watching with winged visitors including wigeon,\u00a0goosander\u00a0and\u00a0whooper swans. You may also see Ospreys swooping down to pluck fish out of the loch. The site includes The Lodge, a Spa and Golf Resort on the edge of the loch.",
