  "description": "This walk visits the Loch of Aboyne in Grampian. The picturesque loch has some nice footpaths running alongside it with views across the water to the surrounding hills and mountains. The loch is also good for wildlife watching with winged visitors including wigeon, goosander and whooper swans. You may also see Ospreys swooping down to pluck fish out of the loch. The site includes The Lodge, a Spa and Golf Resort on the edge of the loch.",

      "content": "Just a couple of miles to the east there's a bit of a hidden gem at the Dess Waterfall. The peaceful spot includes some nice woodland walks along the Dess Burn with picturesque falls to admire as well. Head a few miles to the west and you could enjoy the circular trail around Loch Kinord. The worthy site includes a waymarked trail taking you through the woodland and along the loch which is situated in the Muir of Dinnet National Nature Reserve. A few miles to the south west there's the beautiful Glen Tanar to explore. Just half a mile to the east you can pick up the Deeside Way. The shared cycling and walking route runs along a disused railway between Aberdeen and Ballater. Head west to Ballater and you could pick up the popular 7 Bridges Walk. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
