  "description": "This pretty Suffolk based village has a picturesque green, a nice village pond and a fine 17th century pub for post walk refreshment. There's some good footpaths to follow into the surrounding Constable country landscape too. This circular walk from the village explores the countryside to the south of the village visiting Stoke By Nayland and Scotland Street. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths north west past Polstead Hall Park towards Bushy Park Wood. The route then heads south towards Homey Bridge and the ford on the River Box. You continue south east along the river before picking up the Stour Valley Path and following it into Stoke By Nayland. The route then heads towards Scotland Place and Scotland Street before heading to Mill Street and returning to Polstead.",
