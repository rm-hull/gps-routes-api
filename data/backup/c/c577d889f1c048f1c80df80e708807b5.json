Water flows from Pebley down through Harthill Reservoir and into the canal at\u00a0SK4982, west of the old Norwood Tunnel. This is the local high point of the canal (makes sense really), because to the East it drops down towards Killamarsh and to the West towards Worksop. The pond is stocked and can be fished on a day ticket."

  "description": "This walk visits Pebley Reservoir and Harthill Reservoir from the Derbyshire village of Barlborough. Starting from the village you can follow a footpath north along Ward Lane to Barlborough Hall before turning north east towards Pebley Reservoir. The lake is good for wildlife with ducks, swans, geese and egrets to look out for on the walk. Just to the north of here there's Harthill Reservoir where there's some nice waterside trails to try. Near here you can pick up the circular Five Churches Walk which visits five historic churches in South Rotherham .",
