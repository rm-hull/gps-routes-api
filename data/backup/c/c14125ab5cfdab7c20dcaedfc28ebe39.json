  "description": "Explore the beautiful Culver Down before visiting Bembridge Fort on this circular walk on the Isle of Wight coast. There are fabulous views over Sandown Bay, Shanklin Bay and the Solent to enjoy on the walk. The downs are also covered in pretty wildflowers such as cowslip, rock rose, Bee orchid and birdsfoot trefoil. These attract many butterflies such as the chalkhill blue. The walk starts at the Culver Cliff car park and heads to Culver Battery and Whitecliff Ledge where there are great views over Whitecliff Bay, Horseshoe Bay and Bembridge. You continue along the coast path before climbing to the hill fort. Here you can explore the remains of 19th-century and First World War fortifications with gun emplacements. From the elevated position there are tremendous views over the downs to the sea. From the fort you descend across Bembridge Down back to the car park. You'll pass the Yarborough Monument, a memorial to Lord Yarborough, the first Commodore of the Royal Yacht Squadron on the way. You can extend your walk by continuing along the Isle of Wight Coast Path in either direction. The Bembridge Trail and the Yar River Trail also pass through the area just north of the hill fort. If you are on a bike then National Cycle Route 67 also runs close to the fort. You can follow the route from Bembridge to Culver Down Road and turn south to reach the downs and the fort.",
