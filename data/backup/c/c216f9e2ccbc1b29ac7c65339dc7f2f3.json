  "description": "This circular walk takes you on a tour of the countryside, woodland and canals surrounding Guildford in Surrey. You will pass through the stunning North Downs and Surrey Hills AONBs, visting a series of pretty villages, historical sites and sites of scientific interest. The walk starts and ends at the village of Ripley and first visits the Silent Pool. This interesting site is run by the Surrey Wildlife Trust as part of the Albury Estate. It's peaceful, eerie charm is popular with walkers and passers by as it's linked to a folklore tale that says King John abducted a woodcutter\u2019s daughter who drowned in the pool. According to local legend, the maiden can be seen at midnight. The path then heads on through the attractive village of Shere. There's nice pubs for refreshments here, lots of pretty cottages, shops including a blacksmith and trekking shop, a tea house, art gallery, and a noteworthy Norman church. From here it is not far to another highlights on the walk at Blackheath Common. With 250 acres of attractive heathland it is popular with local cyclists and walkers.

You can find them at 17 Church Street with postcode GU7 1EL for your sat navs. The Inn on the Lake is another good option in the town. There's a particularly lovely garden here and a great Sunday roast. You can find them on the Ockford Road at postcode GU7 1RH. They are dog friendly if you have your canine friend with you."
