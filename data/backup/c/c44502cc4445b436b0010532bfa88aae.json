  "description": "Enjoy miles of footpaths and mountain bike trails in this super forest in Carmarthenshire. There are three colour coded mountain bike trails of varying difficulty. The green/blue Derwen trail is great for novices looking for an introduction to the sport. The red Gorlech trail is a hard, fast, all weather surface suitable for the more experienced rider. The black Raven trail is a real test of your skills and is receiving great reviews from experienced enthusiasts of the sport. Walkers are catered for with a number of well laid out circular walks taking you through the peaceful forest and into the wider countryside. The forest is located near to Abergorlech, Brechfa, and Llanybydder. To continue your walking head east to Abergorlech where you can enjoy a riverside walk through the Cothi Valley and explore the wonderful ruins of the 12th century Talley Abbey .",

The park surrounds the Golden Grove mansion and includes a deer park, peacocks, views of the Tywi Valley and an aboretum with some fine specimen trees. A few miles north east of Llandeilo there's the climb to the viewpoint and two Iron Age Hill Forts on Garn Goch. The forest is also not far from the town of Carmarthen where you can pick up the Welsh Coast Path and enjoy some wonderful sea views."
