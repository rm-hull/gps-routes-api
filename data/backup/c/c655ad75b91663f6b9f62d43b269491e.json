A panoramic view of the park by Thomas Badeslade, published in 1742, shows the resulting grand baroque layout of formal gardens and avenues. This included formal gardens to the east of the castle, with a walled outer courtyard and kitchen gardens to the north. Most of this layout was swept away by extensive landscaping in the 1760s and 70s, undertaken by William Emes, on behalf of Richard Myddelton, including the construction of a ha-ha and the removal of the Davies gates to be re-erected at the New Hall entrance.These works were largely responsible for the present-day appearance of the park."

This parkland was originally laid out as a deer park in the 14th century. From the early 17th century there were both formal and kitchen gardens adjacent to the castle, probably on the eastern side. The gardens continued to develop after the English Civil War, including the construction of an outer courtyard to the north, surrounded by stone walls with a wrought-iron gateway. By 1719 the courtyard had been turfed over and the gates replaced by a magnificent set of wrought-iron gates and gate screen made by Robert and John Davies of Bersham."

In 2018 and 2018 the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust excavated a section across Offa's Dyke here, and found substantial remains of the ditch and bank. The parkland landscape had partly been responsible for preserving the remains of the Dyke."

The station is on the Shrewsbury to Chester Line 21 miles (34 km) north of Shrewsbury. There is an hourly northbound service to Holyhead via Wrexham General and Chester. There's also an hourly southbound service to Shrewsbury. Just to the south you can visit the Chirk Aqueduct and the adjacent viaduct. You can access the site by heading through the Chirk Tunnel just to the west of the train station. There are some glorious views over the River Ceiriog Valley from the top of the elevated structure. Crossing the aqueduct will take you across the border into England. In Chirk you can continue your walking by picking up a nice waymarked walking trail along the River Ceiriog. If you follow it west it links up with the Offa's Dyke Path National Trail. You could follow this epic trail north to visit Warren Wood, just to the west of the castle. Head south and it will take you to Selattyn Hill. To the west you can visit the villages of Glyn Ceiriog and Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog where you can explore the beautiful Upper Ceiriog Valley and enjoy a waterside walk along Nant Y Pandy. The splendid Berwyn Mountains can also be explored on the North Berwyn Way in this area."
