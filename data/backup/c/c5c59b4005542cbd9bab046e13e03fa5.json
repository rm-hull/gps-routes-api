  "description": "The Warwickshire settlement of Alcester has several popular waymarked walking trails running through or close by the town. This fine circular walk uses sections of the Arden Way , the Monarch's Way and the Heart of England Way to explore the countryside and woodland surrounding the old Roman town. You'll visit highlights such as Coughton Court , Oversley Wood , the River Arrow, the old Arrow Mill and the Spernal section of the Heart of England Forest. Starting in the town centre by the river, you first head south east along the Arden Way to Oversley Wood. There's some nice trails here with with lots of bluebells and wildflowers to enjoy in the spring and summer months. The route then heads north east through farmland towards Upton, Walcote and Aston Cantlow where there are good views of the River Alne. You continue north from the village, passing Spernal Park before coming to Bannam's Wood. The route turns south here across Morton Common to the village of Spernall, located on the River Arrow. From here there's a nice stretch along the river to Coughton. Here you can visit the Tudor Coughton Court with its walled garden, lake, knot garden, vegetable garden, orchard and bog garden. From here you head east to New End before picking up the Monarch's Way to return you to Alcester. To continue your walking in the area head south east and visit Stratford Upon Avon . There's some fine waterside walks along the canal and the River Avon here.",
