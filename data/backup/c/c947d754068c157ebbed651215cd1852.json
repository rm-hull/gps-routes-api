  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Shropshire village of Hodnet. The village is known for the delightful Hodnet Hall Gardens which are open to the public from March through to the end of October. There's 60 acres of lovely gardens to explore with lakes, bluebell woodland, a Water Garden and a Kitchen Garden. You can follow the well laid out footpaths around the site before enjoying refreshment in the on site tea rooms. A stroll around Hodnet village is also very pleasant with a church dating back to the Norman period and a fine 16th century pub. To continue your walking in the area head west to visit the nearby Hawkstone Park. It's another special place with a large lake, place pathways, ravines, arches, bridges, towering cliffs and follies to see.",
