  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the lovely coastline at Amroth and visit the National Trust's Colby Woodland Garden. The walk starts near the sea front in Amroth and follows a footpath north to the delightful Colby Woodland Garden. Here you will find 8 acres of woodland, widlflower meadows and gardens with a variety of plants and flowers such as azaleas, bluebells, camellias, magnolias, rhododendrons. In the walled garden there is a Victorian Gothic inspired gazebo and fine Japanese maples. The wildflower meadow has pretty streams and ponds and there are peaceful woodland trails in the woodland garden. The secluded wooded valley is home to a variety of wildlife. Look out for Dippers, bats, otters, frogs and toads. After leaving the gardens you can return to the sea front on the same path and then enjoy a stroll along the prom in Amroth. To extend your walking in the area follow the Pembrokeshire Coast Path west and try the splendid Amroth to Saundersfoot Walk and Tenby to Saundersfoot Walk .",
