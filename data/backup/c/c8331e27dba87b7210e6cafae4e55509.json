  "description": "This small lake next to Hartsop village is perfect for a peaceful walk away from the Lake District's hot spots.  Brothers Water lies at the northern end of the Kirkstone Pass, giving fabulous views on the descent towards Patterdale. You start off at the car park at the northern end of the lake and follow the footpath around the lake which includes a gentle climb to Hartsop Hall. It's about a 2 mile walk which should suit most abilities. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb up to Angle Tarn and Hayeswater which can be easily reached from Hartsop.",
