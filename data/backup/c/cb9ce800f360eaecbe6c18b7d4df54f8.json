  "description": "Enjoy a challenging circular walk around this beautiful, peaceful valley near Keswick. The route climbs to some of the prominent peaks in the valley with superb views for the duration of the walk. For an easier walk just park at the same car park and follow the first section of the route down to Newlands Chapel. The 16th-century church has stained glass windows and a pulpit dated 1610. Start the walk from the car park at Little Town, just to the west of Cat Bells. This area has been made famous as the setting for the story of Mrs Tiggy Winkle by Beatrix Potter. Head west past the chapel towards High Snab where you pick up a footpath along the Scope Beck. This will take you up to Robinson fell which stands at a height of 737m (2,418 ft). There's splendid views across the valley from here. The route then descends to Littledale Edge and Hindscarth Edge before climbing to Dale Head, which stands at a height of 753 m (2,470 ft). There's more great views down the valley with Skiddaw making a fine backdrop. From Dale Head you descend to the north, passing along the Newlands Beck to Castle Nook and Lowthwaite Crag, before returning to Littletown. To continue your walking in the area you could climb to Catbells which lies just half a mile to the east of the Little Town car park. One of the most popular spots in the Lake District, the fell affords lovely views over Derwent Water below. The longer and more challenging Newlands Horseshoe takes in Catbells, Maiden Moor and High Spy just to the east.",
