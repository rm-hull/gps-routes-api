  "description": "This walk visits Salhouse Broad in the Norfolk Broads National Park. The pretty little broad is located between Salhouse and Woodbastwick near to the larger settlements of Wroxham and Horning. The walk can be started from the public car park just to the north east of Salhouse village, off the Salhouse Road. From here you can follow public footpaths north to visit the broad. There's nice trails along the broad with views of the River Bure, which runs through the area. The area is good for wildlife spotting with several species of dragonfly and various water loving birds.",
