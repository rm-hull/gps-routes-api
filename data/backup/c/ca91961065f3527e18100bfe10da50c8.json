  "description": "Explore the beautiful Clwydian Range and Dee Valley in this stunning country park in Mold.  Dramatic limestone cliffs, wooded gorges and secluded grasslands dominate the scenery while the River Alyn also runs through the park. Highlights include the walkway over the Devil's Gorge - a popular spot for abseilers.  There are also several caves to explore, a restored water mill and the pretty riverside tea gardens. The park contains the Clwydian Range Centre where you will find a wealth of information including details of the way-marked walks in the park. Loggerheads is located just to the west of Mold. Clywd Forest is only about a mile to the west and is a good option if you would like to continue your outing. You could also climb the splendid Moel Famau for wonderful views over the area. In nearby Ruthin you can explore the lovely grounds of the medieval Ruthin Castle. There's also nice walks along the River Clwyd to enjoy here.",
