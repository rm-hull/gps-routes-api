The south coast of the Island , at one time had at least four or five oar driven lifeboats. With the advent of the motor lifeboat it became possible for them to travel greater distances, and so not as many were required. This stretch of coast was notorious for the number of shipwrecks. It was very inhospitable for sailing ships."

Work began on the breakwater in 1847 when Britain was fighting the Napolini wars and was completed with the construction of the large round end in 1855.\nIt was constructed by tipping a huge mound of rubble - a bund - on to the sea floor off the end of a wooden trestle.\nOn to this the walls of dressed stone blocks with rubble infill was built.\nThe plan was to have this northern breakwater accompanied by a southern one to create a huge \"refuge\" harbour from which the Royal Navy could challenge the French Fleet as soon as they left harbour.\nBy 1855 Britain and France had become allies against the Russians and the harbour was no longer needed.\nThe roundhead is some 606m out to sea and, after 150 years of buffeting by the sea, is beginning to subside.\nIt is thought the bund was not large enough and cavities have formed in the rubble inside the roundhead."

  "description": "Visit the most southerly point on the Isle of Wight on this circular walk around St Catherine's Point and St Catherine's Down. It's a particularly lovely part of the island with steep cliffs, attractive woodland, grassland with wildflowers and stunning coastal views. The walk start from the Niton undercliff car park and follows footpaths down to St Catherine's Point via Knowles Farm. In 1901 Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the radiotelegraph system, succeeded in transmitting radio signals from Knowles Farm to the Lizard Radio Telegraph Station 186 miles away in Cornwall. The route continues around the impressive 19th century lighthouse, passing along the cliff towards Reeth Bay. Here you climb back to Knowles Farm and the car park passing the 16th century Buddle Inn. It's a charming Oldy Worlde Pub with outdoor seating and great views. It's roughly the half way point on the walk so an ideal place for refreshments! If you'd like to extend your walk you could pick up the Isle of Wight Coast Path and follow it to the nearby Ventnor Downs and St Boniface Down , the highest point on the island. You can visit the lighthouse by bike by following Regional Cycle Route 67 otherwise known as the 'Round the Island' route.",
