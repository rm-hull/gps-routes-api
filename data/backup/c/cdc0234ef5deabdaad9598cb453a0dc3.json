It is part of the Bridehead estate but is a nature reserve managed by Natural England. Sheep graze in the bottom field (pictured). The higher slopes are populated by English longhorn cattle. Their beef is for sale in Abbotsbury. Folklore attributes the origin of the stones to have been two giants playing stone-throwing games, but they are the result of conditions at the end of the last ice age, when freezing and thawing caused sandstone on surrounding hilltops to break up and slump downhill."

  "description": "This delightful village in Dorset is a lovely place for an easy stroll. The settlement includes the Little Bredy Walled Garden, a waterfall, a lake, an old church and footpaths along the River Bride which runs through the village. This circular walk visits the gardens before heading into the surrounding countryside to visit some of the local ancient sites. This includes the Kingston Russell stone circle which includes a late Neolithic or early Bronze Age circle of 18 fallen stones, on a hilltop overlooking Abbotsbury. To the south east there's also The Valley of Stones, another historic site described by Sir Frederick Treves as \"a mysterious glen among the downs, on whose grassy slopes many huge stones are scattered\". To continue your walking in the area head a couple of miles east to visit the Hardy Monument. There's some wonderful views over the area from the elevated position of the monument to Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy. The epic South West Coast Path can also be picked up in this area.",
