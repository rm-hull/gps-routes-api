  "description": "This forest in the Cairngorms National Park has miles of fantastic cycling and walking trails to enjoy. This circular route starts at the excellent visitor centre and follows cycle and walking trails into the forest and alongside the lovely Loch Morlich. The loch has a pretty beach perfect for relaxing on after your ride/walk, while the visitor centre has a great cafe with refreshments. There's also a wide variety of wildlife to look out for including Scottish Crossbill, Crested Tit, Capercaillie and Red Deer. The magnificent Cairngorms mountains make a wonderful backdrop for the route. From the nearby town of Aviemore you could pick up the excellent Speyside Way for more cycling and walking in the area.",

      "content": "If you head east from the visitor centre you could visit the unusual Green Loch. The small lake is a popular spot to visit in the park with its photogenic turquoise hue. To the south east there's the challenging climb to Cairn Gorm and the beautiful Loch Avon to explore. Loch an Eilein can be found to the west. Just west of Aviemore there's the wonderful Craigellachie Nature Reserve. The reserve includes a series of lochans, fascinating plantlife and a wonderful viewpoint towards the nearby Cairn Gorm. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
