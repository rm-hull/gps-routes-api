  "description": "Visit this beautiful island off the south coast of Devon on this lovely coastal walk. Burgh Island is located just a few hundred metres from the small seaside village of Bigbury on Sea . You can walk to the island at low tide or catch the sea tractor which is run by the island's hotel. On the island you will find three private houses, a\u00a0public house, the ruins of the former chapel and the restored 1920s\u00a0Art Deco-style hotel. \u00a0The island has a strong assocation with Agatha Christie, serving as the inspirational setting for both\u00a0And Then There Were None and the\u00a0Hercule Poirot\u00a0mystery\u00a0Evil Under the Sun with the 2002 TV adaptation of the book filmed here. This walk starts at the car park on the sea front in Bigbury-on-Sea and walks out across the sands to the island. There are lovely walking trails taking you around the island with its beautiful coves, rocky outcrops and beaches. The view of the Devon coast and countryside is also marvellous. Burgh Island is on the South West Coast Path so you can easily extend your walk by heading along this fantastic trail. Heading west will take you to the beautiful Erme Estuary where there's pretty beaches, coastal views and lots of wildlife to look out for. Just to the east you can pick up the Avon Estuary Walk . Here you can link up with the Thurlestone and Bantham Walk . On the walk you'll visit the National Trust's lovely South Milton beach, the striking Thurlestone Rock Arch and a great beachside seafood cafe.",
