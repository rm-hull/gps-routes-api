  "description": "This circular walk on the Cornish coast takes you to Northcott Mouth and Sandymouth from popular the town of Bude. The walk starts at the Summerleaze Beach car park at Bude where you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow it north along the cliff top path to Crooklets Beach, Wrangle Point and Maer Down. You continue north past Menachurch Point to Sandy Mouth where you'll find a lovely National Trust beach, waterfalls and a nice cafe for refreshments. After enjoying the beach you can then return to Bude on alternative country footpaths, taking you through the village of Flexbury.",

It's another popular local area for walking with fine cliff top views and a nice beach. There's good facilities too with a car park and a beach-side pub with sea views. The walk includes a visit to the historic Norman church at the little hamlet of St Gennys. You can also pick up the Boscastle to Crackington Haven Walk here. This takes you south to Boscastle, passing High Cliff, the highest point on the Cornish coast on the way."
