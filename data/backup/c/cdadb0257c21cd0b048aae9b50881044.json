  "description": "This walk visits Harrop Tarn near Thirlmere Reservoir in the Lake District. The tarn lies to the west of the lake on the Dob Gill and can be reached on a steadily rising footpath which runs for just under half a mile. You can start your walk from the Dob Gill car park and then follow the pleasant footpath west to reach the tarn. On the way you'll pass a pretty waterfall before coming to the picturesque tarn which is surrounded by attractive woodland and hills. You can continue your walking in the area by climbing to the viewpoints at Helvellyn or Raven Crag .",
