  "description": "A circular riverside walk around the centre of Colchester, visiting Colchester Castle and the River Colne.  The historic market town is the oldest recorded Roman town in Britain, and claimed to be the oldest town in Britain. It has a fascinating Roman history with many features of the occupation still visible today. The walk starts at the Grade I listed Colchester Castle. The castle is a largely complete Norman castle, dating from the 11th century. It is surrounded by Castle Park where there's attractive parkland, trees, flowers, a model boating pond and a number of historic sites. You can visit the Roman Town Wall, the Norman Castle Keep, foundations of Roman Town Houses, an 18th century Summerhouse and Hollytrees House built in 1718.  There's also a fascinating museum where you can find out about 2000 years of some of the most important events in British history. After passing the castle the walk heads north through the Victorian Shrub Garden to the pretty boating lake. Here you come to Middle Mill Weir on the River Colne. A riverside footpath heads east and then south around the bend of the river to East Street. Turn right along East Hill and it will take you back to the castle grounds. The walk can be extended by continuing along the river to The Hythe, Rowhedge and Wivenhoe. This section is known as the Wivenhoe Trail and includes interesting sculptures and fine views.",
