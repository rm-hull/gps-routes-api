  "description": "Enjoy a series of well laid out cycling and walking trails in this 240 acre country park in Nottingham. There are four colour coded routes of varying lengths and difficulty. Features in the park include a large lake, woodland and great views over the surrounding Nottinghamshire countryside. It's also great for birdwatching - look out for short eared owls, skylarks and lapwings. The park also has food facilities with two car parks and picnic tables. Just to the east of the park you can extend your exercise on the riverside trails near the villages of Shelford, Gunthorpe, Fiskerton, Rolleston and Radcliffe on Trent .",
