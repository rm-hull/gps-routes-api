  "description": "Enjoy an easy waterside walk along this pretty lake on the Longleat Estate. The lake is located near Warminster and has a nice walking trail running alongside the 37 acre lake. It's a lovely area for a picnic with the lake surrounded by attractive flora and fauna. Look out for little sailboats and various wildfowl on the lake and fish in the water. There are miles of woodland trails surrounding the lake so you can easily extend your walk here.  One option would be to head west to Heaven's Gate for great views over the Longleat Estate. There is a car park right next to the lake so access is easy.  You can also enjoy refreshments at the lakeside cafe. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could climb the nearby Cley Hill and enjoy wonderful views over West Wiltshire and Somerset.",
