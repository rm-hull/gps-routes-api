  "description": "This walk climbs to the Peel Monument on Holcombe Hill in Ramsbottom near Bury. The tower is dedicated to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th century Prime Minister considered the father of modern British policing. The impressive landmark stands at a height of 1,100 feet (335 m) above sea level, commanding wonderful views over the surrounding countryside and towns. This circular walk climbs to the tower before exploring the expansive Holcombe Moor. Start the walk from the car park just to the south east of the tower, on Lumb Carr Road. From here you head west, crossing Holcombe Old Road and Moorbottom Road. Turn to the south west and then climb up to the Millennium bench where you can sit and enjoy the views. From here you turn north and follow the paths up to the 128 feet (39 m) high monument. There's wonderful views over Manchester to North Wales from the elevated position of the monument. The route then leaves the tower to cross Holcombe Moor. You head west towards Quarlton Heights, before turning east to Beetle Hill. This section passes close to a military firing range, so take care around here. From Beetle Hill you descend towards Stubbins and Chatterton, where you follow the River Irwell south into Ramsbottom. Here you leave the river and head west to Holcombe and the finish point back at the car park. The last section passes the Shoulder of Mutton which is a great place for refreshments after your exercise. The pub is walker friendly and has a car park which can be used as an alternative start point. The walk uses a section of the Rossendale Way long distance footpath on Holcombe Moor. You can extend your walk by heading north along the trail to the nearby Ogden Reservoir and Calf Hey Reservoir . You could also pick up the Irwell Sculpture Trail in Ramsbottom. Following the trail south will take you along the River Irwell to Burrs Country Park and Bury .",
