  "description": "This large area of open space in south west London covers 1,140 acres. It's great for cycling and walking with numerous trails criss crossing the area. The route starts at the iconic windmill and follows good tracks around the Wimbledon Common golf course which covers a large section of the common. You'll pass the pretty Queen's Mere and King's Mere which are surrounded by woodland paths. Other attractions on the common include the windmill museum and an easy access nature trail taking you through grassland, woodland and heath. This can be accessed near the windmill. If you would like to continue your exercise then you could head to the nearby Richmond Park where there are miles of cycling and walking opportunities. The delightful Beverley Brook Walk also runs along the western edge of the common so you could pick this up and head to the River Thames at Putney. You can start your exercise from the free car park at the Windmill at postcode SW19 5NR. There's also a small museum to visit here where you can learn about milling history in the area.",
