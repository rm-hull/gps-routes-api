  "description": "This large area of open space in south west London covers 1,140 acres. It's great for cycling and walking with numerous trails criss crossing the area. The route starts at the iconic windmill and follows good tracks around the Wimbledon Common golf course which covers a large section of the common. You'll pass the pretty Queen's Mere and King's Mere which are surrounded by woodland paths. Other attractions on the common include the windmill museum and an easy access nature trail taking you through grassland, woodland and heath. This can be accessed near the windmill. If you would like to continue your exercise then you could head to the nearby Richmond Park where there are miles of cycling and walking opportunities. The delightful Beverley Brook Walk also runs along the western edge of the common so you could pick this up and head to the River Thames at Putney. You can start your exercise from the free car park at the Windmill at postcode SW19 5NR. There's also a small museum to visit here where you can learn about milling history in the area.",

      "content": "Back at the car park you can enjoy refreshments at the Windmill Tearooms. There's lots of outdoor seating where you can enjoy a meal with a view of the old mill and the common. For a pub lunch you could head to The Fox and Grapes which is located close to the southern side of the common near Wimbledon village. The pub dates back to the 18th century and has a varied menu serving high quality food. You can find them on 9 Camp Road with a postcode of SW19 4UN for your sat navs."

      "subtitle": "Dog Walking",
      "content": "The woodland and open spaces on the common are ideal for dog walking. You are bound to bump into other owners on your visit. Please be aware that some of the paths are used by cyclists and there is also a golf course to keep in mind. There are plenty of bins dotted around the site. The Fox and Grapes mentioned above is very dog friendly with treats available."

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "The Capital Ring passes through the northern end of the common. The epic circular route runs for nearly 80 miles, visiting several of London's landmarks, green areas and parks. You could follow it west to Richmond Park and the River Thames. Heading east will take you to Wimbledon Park Lake where there are some nice trails, a cafe and tennis courts. This area is also very close to the famous All England Lawn Tennis club where the Wimbledon championships take place each year. For more walking ideas in the area see the London Walks page."
