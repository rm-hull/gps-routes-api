  "description": "This walk visits a wonderful natural hole and waterfall on the slopes of Pen y ghent. The large hole is often visited on the way up to Pen y ghent but it makes a worthy walk in its own right. You can start the walk in the village of Horton in Ribblesdale. Here you can pick up the Pennine Way and follow the waymarked trail north east to Horton Scar. Shortly after you leave the trail to follow another path short distance up to Hull Pot. Here you'll find England's largest naturally formed hole measuring 91 metres (300 feet) long by 18 metres (60 feet) wide by 18 metres (60 feet) deep. The waterfall that flows into it from the Hull Pot Beck is a spectacular sight after rainfall. After enjoy the falls and the fine views from its elevated position you return to Horton on the same paths.",
