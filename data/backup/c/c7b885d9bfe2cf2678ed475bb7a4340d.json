  "description": "This circular walk takes you around Pentwyn or Dol-y-gaer Reservoir in the Brecon Beacons. You'll also pass through a section of the Taf Fechan Forest while enjoying views of the adjacent Brecon Beacons Mountain railway which runs along the eastern side of the lake. You can start your walk from the public car park at the southern end of the reservoir, next to the northern tip of the adjacent Pontsticill Reservoir . From here you can pick up the Taff Trail along the western side towards the Torpantau railway station. The route then follows forestry tracks south to return to the southern end via the Dol-y-gaer station. Along the way there are glorious views over the lake and attractive forest to the surrounding hills and mountains of the Brecon Beacons.",
