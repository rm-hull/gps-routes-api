  "description": "This pleasant Hertfordshire based village is located near Welwyn Garden City and Hertford. The rural settlement is surrounded by woodland and countryside with several waymarked walking trails to explore. The village itself is typical of England with an old Church, two pubs, a village green, a red telephone box and a shop. This route from Tewin uses sections of the Hertfordshire Chain Walk and the Lea Valley Walk to create a circular walk around the village. There's also an optional short detour to visit Hertford Castle. The walk starts in the village and follows a public footpath south east past Lamb Dell Wood, Flexleys Wood and Marden Hill where you pick up the Hertfordshire Chain Walk. Follow the waymarked footpath south east and it will take you to Birch Green, crossing the River Mimram before passing through the woodland around Brocket Hill. At Birch Green you can pick up the Lea Valley Walk and follow it east into Hertford where you can explore the historic castle. The route then retraces its steps to Hertingfordbury where you pass through the village and head north to Blakemore Wood and Lady Hughe's Wood. You continue north west through Selebroom Wood to the expansive Bramfield Park Wood. From here you pick up a country lane to take you past Tewin Hill and return you to the village. Just to the south you can take a small detour to visit Tewin Bury Farm. The hotel estate is well worth a visit with trails along the River Mimram, picturesque gardens, the Tewin Nature Reserve and the Grade I listed St Peter's Church to see.",
