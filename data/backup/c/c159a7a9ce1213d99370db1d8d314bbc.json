  "description": "This long circular walk explores the rivers and waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, also known as 'Waterfall Country'. It's a spectacularly beautiful area with a huge number of waterfalls to see. The falls are of varying size with some of them allowing you to walk behind them for a really special experience. This route runs for about 9 miles on generally good footpaths with some moderate climbing as you cross the countrsyide between the two woodland gorges. The route starts in the village of Pontneddfechan and heads north along the Afon Nedd Fechan and the Afon Pyrddin where there's a lovely wooded gorge and the Sgwd Gwladus falls to see. The route then heads north east out of the gorge into open countryside towards Ystradfellte. Here you can pick up the popular Four Waterfalls Walk to visit Sgwd Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd Isaf Clun-Gwyn, Sgwd y Pannwr and Sgwd-yr-Eira waterfalls. The route then follows more woodland trails through the forest to the east of the village before returning to Pontneddfechan. Near the town of Neath itself there are two more lovely waterfalls to visit. You could head north of the town to Aberdulais Falls where you can enjoy the rushing water of the River Dulais surrounded by cliffs and interesting vegetation. To the east you can visit the 80 feet high Melincourt Falls near Resolven.",
