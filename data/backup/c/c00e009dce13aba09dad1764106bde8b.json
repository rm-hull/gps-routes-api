  "description": "This circular walk climbs to Dufton Pike from the village of Dufton in the North Pennines AONB. The walk starts in Dufton where you can pick up the Pennine Way and follow the waymarked trail north along Hurning Lane. At Cosca Hill you turn east along the Great Rundale Beck before turning south east to climb to Dufton Pike. The summit stands at a height of 481 m (1,578 ft) and provides fine views over the surrounding hills of the North Pennines and the Eden Valley. On a clear day you can also see the Lake District fells. After taking in the views you head east before turning south west along the Pus Gill. This will lead you past Pusgill House before returning to the village.",
