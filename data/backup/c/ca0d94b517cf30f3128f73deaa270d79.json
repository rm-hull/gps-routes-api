  "description": "This Powys village is located in a nice spot for walks along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and the Taff Trail . The latter is also suitable for cyclists. This circular walk from the village visits the canal, the Grade II listed Cefn Brynich Canal Bridge Aqueduct and the neighbouring village of Pencelli . Along the way there's some splendid views of the hills and mountains of the Brecon Beacons National Park.",
