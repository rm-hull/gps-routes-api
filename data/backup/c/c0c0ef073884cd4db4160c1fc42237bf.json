  "description": "This Devon based town sits in a fine location for walkers on the northern edge of the Dartmoor National Park. Okehampton is also the start/finish point for the Two Castles Trail and the Granite Way, a shared cycling and walking trail running along a disused railway line to the wonderful Lydford Gorge. The town itself is also worth exploring with historic highlights including the 15th century Chapel of St James and the medieval ruins of Okehampton Castle which is now run as a tourist attraction by English Heritage. This circular walk from the town visits some of the local highlights including Meldon Reservoir, Meldon Viaduct, Yes Tor, Okehampton Common and the highest point on Dartmoor at High Willhays. The walk starts at the car park and visitor centre near the train station in the town. From here you head west along the Dartmoor Way to the Meldon Viaduct and the reservoir. The 19th century structure is an impressive sight with a lovely circular trail around the adjacent reservoir to try as well. The route continues east across Okehampton Common to climb to the splendid viewpoint at Yes Tor. The tor is Dartmoor's second highest peak, at 619 metres (2,031 ft) above sea level. From here you continue a short distance south to climb to the high point at High Willhays. You then head towards West Mill Tor before turning north to Black Down and Okehampton Park. To continue your walking around Okehampton head north to visit Abbeyford Woods where there are a series of peaceful woodland walking paths and mountain bike trails.",
