The line was a candidate for closure in the 1960s and '70s but has survived as a lifeline for remote communities and carries a healthy tourist trade in summer. The station buildings are now used as self-catering holiday accommodation."

  "description": "This delightful Scottish village sits in a lovely spot on the shores of Loch Carron. It's considered one of the prettiest in the country and has been described as \"The Jewel of the Highlands\". This walk takes you through the village and along the shores of the loch to nearby Duncraig. On the way you will visit the remote rail stations of Plockton and  Duncraig on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line. It's just over two miles with glorious views over the loch to enjoy on the way. On the opposite side of the loch you can pick up the Lochcarron Walk and visit the highly photogenic ruins of Strome Castle. From here you can enjoy an alternative view back to Plockton as well.",
