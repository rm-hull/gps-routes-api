  "description": "This large forest near Wrexham is a fantastic place for walking and cycling. There are 50km of graded, waymarked mountain bike trails. The trails range from nice easy family trails to more exhilarating downhill tracks. The Green Route is a leisurely ride around the pretty Pendinas Reservoir with views of the Clwydian Range. At the other end of the scale is the challenging Black Route with steep descents, large steps, gaps and drop-offs. The Blue route is a good one to try for people new to mountain bikers while the Red Route is for Intermediate riders. Walkers are also well catered for with a series of waymarked walks. Easy trail include one around the reservoir with views of Moel Famau. There's also a nice trail across the Ruabon moors where you can look out for the Black Grouse from the bird hides. The forest has an excellent visitor centre with bike hire and a cafe. The Offa's Dyke Path runs through the forest so you could pick this up to extend your exercise. If you follow the trail south for a couple of miles you will come to the lovely wooded gorge at World's End .",
