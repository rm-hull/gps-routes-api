  "description": "This short walk visits a lovely waterfall at the base of Torc Mountain, in County Kerry. It's a beautiful section of the Killarney National Park, with easy trails to follow along the Owengarriff River and a series of dramatic, rushing falls. There's a couple of conveniently located car parks close to the falls. From here you can pick up the riverside trails, which will lead you to a viewpoint where you can see the 18 metre high Torc Waterfall cascade. Red deer are often spotted in the area so keep your eyes peeled as you make your way along the trail. The falls are located close to Mucross Lake where there's a fantastic circular trail to try around the deepest lake in Ireland. The 14km walk also visits Lough Leane, another of the famous three Lakes of Killarney. The Lough Leane And Ross Castle Walk visits an historic 15th century castle on the shores of the lough in this area too. Part of this walk uses the Kerry Way long distance footpath. You could follow the trail all the way to the falls from the town of Killarney if you prefer. Heading south will take you up to Torc Mountain for wonderful views over the area.",

      "content": "Just to the east there's Lough Guitane where there's a nice walking trail on the eastern side of the scenic lough. To the north west there's Annascaul Lake on the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry. The picturesque lake sits in a wonderful remote spot surrounded by mountains and a beautiful river valley. Here you can also pick up the Dingle Way, an epic circular walk classified as one of Ireland's National Waymarked Trails."
