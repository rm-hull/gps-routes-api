  "description": "This is the complete route from Glasgow to Edinburgh along the Forth and Clyde Canal and the Union Canal . The route follows National Cycle Network Routes 7, 75 and 754 so is well signed throughout. It follows the towpath of these two major canals and is traffic free for the duration so it is also suitable for walkers. The route runs for a distance of about 66 miles so it is possible to complete it in one day if you have a good level of fitness. You start at the Bowling Basin and head through Clydebank, Kirkintilloch, Falkirk and Linlithgow to the finish point in the centre of Edinburgh. There's beautiful countryside, nature reserves, country parks, rivers and spectacular aqueducts to enjoy as you make your way across central Scotland. Route highlights include the four-arched 120 metre long Kelvin Aqueduct and the Kelvin Walkway in Glasgow. On the outskirts of Falkirk you'll come to the famous Falkirk Wheel . The rotating boat lift connects the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal lifting boats from the basin to the aqueduct 24 metres above.  In Linlithgow you'll pass the splendid Beecraigs Country Park which has miles of woodland cycling and walking trails.",
