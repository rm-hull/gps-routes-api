  "description": "This walk follows the River Kelvin from Milngavie to the Glasgow Heliport on the River Clyde. The walk was created to form a 'green link' from the countryside to the parks, museums, galleries and historical/cultural landmarks in Glasgow. The walk runs through Kelvinside, Kelvingrove Park and Yorkhill with fine views of Glasgow University. The walk links with the Forth and Clyde Canal at the Kelvin Aqueduct so you could enjoy a canalside stroll here too. At the start of the route there are nice walks to be found around Milngavie Reservoir and Mugdock Country Park .",
