However, Stranraer soon surpassed Portpatrick as the primary port for this purpose. The railway was often called \"The Paddy\" due to its Irish connection. A branch line, the Wigtownshire Railway, was added in 1875, connecting Newton Stewart to Whithorn via a junction with the Portpatrick Railway. The entire PPR route, also referred to as the \"Port Road,\" linked Dumfries with Portpatrick and Stranraer, forming a key rail and sea route between England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland."
