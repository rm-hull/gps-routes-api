      "caption": "Luce Viaduct. The Portpatrick Railway was established to connect Castle Douglas with Portpatrick in 1861 and 1862, aiming to revitalise transportation to Ireland via Portpatrick. However, Stranraer soon surpassed Portpatrick as the primary port for this purpose. The railway was often called \"The Paddy\" due to its Irish connection. A branch line, the Wigtownshire Railway, was added in 1875, connecting Newton Stewart to Whithorn via a junction with the Portpatrick Railway. The entire PPR route, also referred to as the \"Port Road,\" linked Dumfries with Portpatrick and Stranraer, forming a key rail and sea route between England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland."
