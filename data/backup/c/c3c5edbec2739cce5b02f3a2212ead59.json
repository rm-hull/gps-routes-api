  "description": "Enjoy a stroll through Dowdeswell Wood to Dowdeswell Reservoir on this circular walk near Cheltenham. It's a pleasant area for a walk with footpaths leading through the woods and along the water. The area is also a nature reserve with lots of wildlife to look out for in the woods and on the reservoir. Keep your eyes peeled for wildfowl such as Moorhen, Coot, Mallard, Little Grebe and Great Crested Grebe. There's lots of interesting plants to see in the woods including Bluebell, Ramsoms (wild garlic),Common Spotted Orchid, Pyramidal Orchid and Cowslip. Roe and Muntjac deer are also visitors to the wood. The Cotswold Way passes along the western edge of the wood so you can pick this up to extend your walk. If you head south you can visit Lineover Wood. Here you will find ancient woodland and limestone grassland with splendid views of Cheltenham and the Malvern Hills. Heading north will take you to Cleeve Common and Cleeve Hill. The Cheltenham Circular Footpath also passes the area. This long distance waymarked walk around Cheltenham gives wonderful views of the Cotswolds escarpment.",
