  "description": "This walk runs along the old trackbed of the Tees Valley Railway, from Cotherstone to Romaldkirk. The railway was originally opened in 1868 and closed in 1965.\u00a0It ran for just over 8 miles between\u00a0Barnard Castle\u00a0and Middleton-in-Teesdale on the\u00a0South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway. The walk runs for about 2.5 miles on a reasonably flat path with nice views of the surrounding Teesdale countryside. In the summer months you can see lots of wildflowers and butterflies along the path. You can extend the walk by continuing to Mickleton and Lonton. To continue your walking in the area, you can try our Teesdale Way Circular Walk which uses riverside paths to explore the area. There are also nice walks around Barnard Castle and the fascinating ruins of Egglestone Abbey .",
