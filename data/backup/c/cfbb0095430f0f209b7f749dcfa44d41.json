  "description": "This Cheshire based village sits in a peaceful rural location in the valley of the River Dean which flows just south of the settlement. This circular walk from the village takes you to one of the area highlights at Lamaload Reservoir. The route starts in the village and heads south east towards Thornsett Farm. You continue east through the Dean Valley countryside to the reservoir. Here you can try a lovely circular trail around the water with some nice woodland trails. The route then heads north west past Yearns Low to Ginclough before returning to the village. To continue your walking around Rainow pick up the Gritstone Trail to the west of the village. You can follow this popular waymarked trail south to visit the wonderful viewpoint at Tegg's Nose Country Park. Less than a mile to the north west there's the climb to White Nancy just outside Bollington .",
