  "description": "This large forest near Andover has miles of woodland walking trails to try. You can reach the forest by following the Test Way from nearby Chilbolton or Wherwell. It's about a one mile walk through the countryside to the woods from Wherwell. The Test Way passes through the woods but there are also other public footpaths to pick up once you are there. The forest has an intersting history with the 19th century Dead Man's Plack to see. The Grade-II listed monument is dedicated to Ethelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia, who (as legend goes) was killed in 963 by his rival in love, King Edgar I. To extend your walking in the area you could head south west along the Test Way towards Stockbridge and visit Danebury Hill Fort. The fascinating Iron Age fort commands wonderful views over the Test Valley. Cyclists can reach the forest area by cycling along National Cycle Route 246 which runs through nearby Goodworth Clatford and Upper Clatford from Andover. The woods are located just to the east of the town of Andover. There's nice trails to follow along the River Anton and around Anton Lakes Nature Reserve here.",
