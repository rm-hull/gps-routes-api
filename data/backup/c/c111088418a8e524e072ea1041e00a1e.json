  "description": "Penllergare Valley Woods in Swansea is a wonderful place for walkers with miles of woodland trails, lakes, and beautiful waterfalls. Once the estate of botanist and pioneer photographer John Dillwyn Llewelyn, the woods have recently been restored by the Penllergare Trust. It's an enchanting place with terraces, waterfalls and cascades and the beautiful stone arched Llewelyn Bridge. There's good walking paths taking you along the river, around the upper and lower lake and through woodland and parkland. There are also good facilities with car parking and a coffee shop.",
