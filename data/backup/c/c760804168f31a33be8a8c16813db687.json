This circular walk from the village takes you south east along Lymes Road before exploring the woodland and lakes in the expansive grounds of Keele University. There's 650 acres to explore with colour coded trails taking you to an Arboretum with over 150 species of tree. Click here for an excellent guided walk leaflet telling you all about the flora and fauna you can see here. The route also passes very close to the famous Keele Services, located on the M6, just south of the village.",
