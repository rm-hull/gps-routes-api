To the north there's another historical house at the National Trust's Wightwick Manor. The Victorian manor house is surrounded by some beautiful gardens and includes some pleasant waterside trails along the adjacent Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. Just up the canal from here is the wildlife rich Smestow Valley Nature Reserve. Nearby there's the village of Perton where there's a nice cyling and walking trail along the River Penk which runs between two pretty lakes. You can then go on to explore the attractive countryside around the historic Wrottesley Park and Wrottesley Hall."
