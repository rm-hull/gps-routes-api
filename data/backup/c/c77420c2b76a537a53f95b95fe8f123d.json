If you fancy something more substantial head into Northend where and pay a visit to The Red Lion. It's a fine traditional village pub with a good menu at reasonable prices. They also have a good sized garden area to relax in on warmer days. You can find the pub just to the north of the park on Bottom Street, Northend with a postcode of CV47 2TJ for your sat navs."

The park is located near the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the famous Edgehill battle field. In the park there's sixteen acres of mixed grass and woodland, with extensive views over the rural South Warwickshire countryside. Near here there's also the village of Tysoe where you could enjoy a climb to the Tysoe Windmill. The photogenic old mill sits on top of a 184 metre hill with excellent views over the Cotswolds. Just to the north west is Gaydon where you can visit the British Motor Museum. The noteworthy museum houses one of the largest collections of historic British cars in the world.
