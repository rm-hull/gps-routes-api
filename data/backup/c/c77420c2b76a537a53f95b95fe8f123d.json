  "description": "This super country park is comprised of a group of ironstone hills which rise to 203m (667 ft). As such there are splendid views over the surrounding Warwickshire countryside from Burton Dassett.  There are 100 acres to explore with sites of historical interest such as the beacon, quarry remains and the nearby 12th Century All Saints Church. The Centenary Way walking route also passes through the park so you could continue your walk if you have time.",
