  "description": "Explore the beautiful River Lune Estuary on this waterside walk near Lancaster. The walk begins in Lancaster and takes you along the Lancashire Coastal Way and the Lune Estuary Footpath to Glasson Dock. It's a nice footpath with lovely views across the Estuary towards Morcambe Bay and the Lake District Mountains in the distance. Cyclists can also enjoy much of this section which forms part of the National Cycle Network. Glasson Dock is an attractive marina which makes a nice point to stop for refreshments. You could also start the walk from here and head north along the river to Lancaster if you prefer. This walk continues past the marina towards Cockersands Abbey, passing the old lighthouse on the way. At the abbey grounds you can see the 13th century vaulted chapter house. It is still intact and is a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. From the abbey you head inland, through the countryside, towards Lower Thurnham. You then follow the Lancaster Canal and the River Conder back to Glasson Dock. Return to Lancaster via the Lune Estuary Footpath and Lancashire Coastal Way .",
