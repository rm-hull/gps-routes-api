  "description": "This easy circular walk takes you around the pretty Dartford Heath in the London Borough of Dartford. There's over 300 acres to explore on a number of different footpaths. It's a pleasant area for a stroll with a number of ponds, peaceful woodland, pretty heather and lots of wildlife to look out for. You can start the walk from the public car park in the centre of the heath. From here you can pick up the paths leading across the heath in various directions. The heath is a great place for flora and fauna with plants including heather, dwarf gorse, and orchids.",
