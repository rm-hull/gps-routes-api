  "description": "This Northumberland based town has some nice coastal trails and paths along the River Blyth estuary to try. This walk in the town takes you along Blyth Beach to the neighbouring village of Seaton Sluice. The walk starts from the car park at South beach and follows a shared cycling and walking path along the coast. It's a flat trail running along the England Coast Path with nice views over the sea. Just west of the path you could pay a visit to the National Trust's Seaton Delaval Hall. The early 18th century Georgian mansion has an interesting history and is surrounded by some lovely gardens. It lies just to the west of Seaton Sluice. You can continue your walking in the area by heading north west into the nearby Bedlington Country Park. There's more pleasant riverside trails, woodland, Humford Mill and lots of wildlife to see here. You can also pick up another cycling and walking path heading east along the Blyth Estuary here.",
