Brundall railway station is located on the Wherry Lines and served by National Express East Anglia, linking Norwich with Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft. The presently unstaffed station is a junction on the Brundall and Yarmouth, and the Norwich and Yarmouth lines - the line to Great Yarmouth (via Acle) diverges from the line to Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth (via Reedham). The station building now houses a shop. There is a manned signalbox east of the westbound platform and a brick hut beside the crossing gates on Station Road for the crossing keeper who manually opens/closes the crossing gates. A footbridge over the line gives access to the westbound platform."

At Whitlingham it is joined by the River Wensum and just before reaching Reedham it is joined by the River Chet. Once past Reedham the river passes long stretches of marshland before it enters the tidal lake of Breydon Water where it is joined by the Rivers Bure and Waveney, and finally flows into the North Sea at Gorleston just south of Great Yarmouth."

  "description": "This riverside village is located just east of Norwich in the Norfolk Broads. There's lots of pretty marinas and a significant boat building industry in the attractive settlement. This walk from the village takes you to the River Yare at Surlingham Broad, just to the south west of the settlement. From the village centre head west along Postwick Lane, passing Brundall Gardens Marina. You can then follow footpaths south to meet with the river opposite the Ferry House Pub at Surlingham. There's a short trail here running south with views over to the Church Lane nature reserve on the other side.",

There's some lovely trails here with River Yare views, marshland, lakes, orchid-rich meadows and lots of birdlife to see. Just over two miles to the east there's Burlingham where you can explore the peaceful trails around Burlingham Woods. It's a lovely place for a stroll with carpets of snowdrops in Ferbruary and lots of bluebells in the spring months. There's also the interesting ancient ruins of the 14th century St Peter church to see here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Norfolk Broads Walks page."
