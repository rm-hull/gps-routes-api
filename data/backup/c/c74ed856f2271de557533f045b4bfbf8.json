  "description": "This circular walk around Lyme Regis makes use of the Monarch's Way and the Wessex Ridgeway to take you up into the countryside above the town before exploring the beautiful coast. The route runs for about 7.5 miles with some moderate climbs to the north of the town around Penn Hill. There's spendid views to the coast from the high points, lovely countryside views and some nice riverside paths to enjoy on the way. The walk starts on the seafront just to the east of the famous Cobb. From here you can pick up the Wessex Ridgeway and follow it north west along the River Lim. You continue past Sleech Wood and through the woodland on Hole Common to Penn which marks the high point of the walk at nearly 500ft. You continue north east to Stubb's Farm where you pick up the Monarch's Way long distance footpath. You follow this all the way back to the coast to Charmouth. You can then walk along the beach back to Lyme Regis but please check the tide times first. If the tide is in then you could follow the inland path along the South West Coast Path to return to Lyme Regis. Along the beach you'll pass the striking cliffs at Black Ven and the Spittles which are a well known fossil hunting spot. For a shorter circular walk you can try the Lyme Regis to Charmouth Walk which heads along the beach before returning along the South West Coast Path through the golf course. You could also head west along the coast on the popular Lyme Regis to Seaton Undercliff Walk or visit the splendid Golden Cap Estate .",
