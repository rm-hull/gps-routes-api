  "description": "Explore this large area of common land on this easy circular walk in south London. The common covers 182 hectares (460 acres) and has a number of good footpaths taking you to woodland, grassland, scrub and the pretty Seven Islands pond. The area is good for wildlife spotting. Look out for birds, frogs, toads and dragonflies around the ponds and butterflies near the wildflower meadow. Interesting flora you can see includes Gorse, Hawthorn copse, Cow parsley, St John\u2019s Wort and elderberries. It's a pretty area, particularly around the large pond. The common is straightforward to access as it is located right next to Mitcham Junction train station and the Beddington Lane Tramlink Stop. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to the nearby Morden Hall Park. Here you can enjoy a waterside walk or cycle along the River Wandle in a 125 acre National Trust estate with parkland and gardens.",
