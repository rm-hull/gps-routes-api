  "description": "There are a number of lovely coastal walking trails around this pretty National Trust run estate in Dorset. The estate is part of the Jurassic Coast and includes cliff-top trails along Burton cliff and the popular shingle Hive beach. You can use the National Trust car park above Burton Cliff to access the walking trails. Alternatively you could follow the South West Coast Path from nearby Bridport to reach the estate. From the area there are splendid views of Chesil Beach and Golden Cap, the highest point on the south coast. The area is also great for flora and fauna with a variety of plants such as pyramidal orchids, thrift, common mallow and wild clary. Look out for birds such as kestrels and buzzards. Burton Bradstock is located at the western end of the beautiful Chesil Beach. You could continue your walk by heading east along Chesil Beach to West Bexington Nature Reserve and Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens in the village of Abbotsbury. Our Circular Walk from West Bay visits the village from the beautiful Bridport Harbour.",

The historic village includes an ancient church and a noteworthy 15th century, thatched pub. A few miles to the north east there's Littlebredy which is something of a hidden gem. The delightful village includes the Little Bredy Walled Garden, a waterfall, a lake, an old church and footpaths along the River Bride which runs through the village. Just a couple of miles to the east of Bridport there's the worthy little village of Shipton Gorge where you can enjoy a climb to Shipton Hill and visit the splendid 15th century church of St Martin."
