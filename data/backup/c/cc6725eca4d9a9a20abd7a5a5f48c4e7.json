  "description": "There are a number of lovely coastal walking trails around this pretty National Trust run estate in Dorset.\nThe estate is part of the Jurassic Coast and includes cliff-top trails along Burton cliff and the popular shingle Hive beach. You can use the National Trust car park above Burton Cliff to access the walking trails. Alternatively you could follow the South West Coast Path from nearby Bridport to reach the estate. From the area there are splendid views of Chesil Beach and Golden Cap , the highest point on the south coast. The area is also great for flora and fauna with a variety of  plants such as pyramidal orchids,\u00a0thrift, common mallow and wild clary. Look out for birds such as kestrels and buzzards. Burton Bradstock is located at the western end of the beautiful Chesil Beach . You could continue your walk by heading east along Chesil Beach to West Bexington Nature Reserve and Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens in the village of Abbotsbury . Our Circular Walk from West Bay visits the village from the beautiful Bridport Harbour.",
