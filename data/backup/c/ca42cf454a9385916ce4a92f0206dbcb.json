  "description": "Follow the Market Harborough Arm of the Grand Union Canal from Market Harborough to Foxton Locks on this waterside walk in Leicestershire. It runs for about 6 miles along a nice flat towpath, passing a series of pretty bridges. The walk starts at the canal basin in Market Harborough. It's a very pretty area with restored red-brick warehouses, waterfowl and lots of barges providing boat trips along the canal. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it past Great Bowden and Gallow Hill to Foxton Locks. Here you'll find an impressive staircase of ten locks located on the Leicester line of the Grand Union Canal. It's a lovely area which is also designated as a country park. The area includes a woodland trail, lovely rural views and the pretty village of Foxton. You can enjoy post walk refreshments at the canalside inn at the end of the walk. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Leicestershire Round long distance trail which runs past Foxton. This will take you to the nearby Saddington Reservoir which has some more nice trails to try. The circular walk from nearby Kibworth will take you to both sites.",

They serve fine food and also have a splendid outdoor area made from old shipping containers, recycled stable partitions and wooden beams. They have heated booths where you can enjoy views of the lovely Mediterranean Garden. It's a fine place to relax after your walk. You can find them on the Main Street at a postcode of LE16 7HB for your sat navs. The pub is also dog friendly. The village is a nice place for a stroll too with a 13th century church to see."

      "content": "Head a few miles north west of the town and you could pay a visit to the delightful hamlet of Wistow. There's much to see here with a popular maze, a Rural Centre with a large garden centre, a model village, a cafe/bistro, a Mediterranean deli, an art gallery and a notable 12th century church. There's also nice paths along the Grand Union Canal and the River Sence to enjoy. You could follow the canal all the way to the site if you wished to visit on foot. A few miles to the east there's Hallaton to explore. The village includes a particularly picturesque pond, a 13th century church and quaint thatched cottages. Hallaton is also the location for the famous annual bottle kicking contest which takes place on Easter Monday. For more walking ideas in the area see the Northamptonshire Walks page."
