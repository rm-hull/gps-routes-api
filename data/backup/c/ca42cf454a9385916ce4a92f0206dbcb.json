  "description": "Follow the Market Harborough Arm of the Grand Union Canal from Market Harborough to Foxton Locks on this waterside walk in Leicestershire. It runs for about 6 miles along a nice flat towpath, passing a series of pretty bridges. The walk starts at the canal basin in Market Harborough. It's a very pretty area with restored red-brick warehouses, waterfowl and lots of barges providing boat trips along the canal. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it past Great Bowden and Gallow Hill to Foxton Locks. Here you'll find an impressive staircase of ten locks located on the Leicester line of the Grand Union Canal. It's a lovely area which is also designated as a country park. The area includes a woodland trail, lovely rural views and the pretty village of Foxton. You can enjoy post walk refreshments at the canalside inn at the end of the walk. To extend your walking in the area you can pick up the Leicestershire Round long distance trail which runs past Foxton. This will take you to the nearby Saddington Reservoir which has some more nice trails to try. The circular walk from nearby Kibworth will take you to both sites.",
