  "description": "This route climbs to Buckden Pike along the Buckden Beck. It's the shortest route to the summit from the village, passing lots of pretty waterfalls on the way. The route runs for about 1.5 miles so around 3 miles there and back. The walk starts from the public parking area in the village of Buckden. From here you can pick up a footpath heading north east along the Buckden Beck. You'll pass a series of waterfalls and the old Buckden Lead Mine before coming to the Buckden Pike summit. From the 702 metres (2,303\u00a0ft) high point there are marvellous views over the Yorkshire Dales including Wharfedale and the Nidderdale AONB. After taking in the views the route descends on the same path.",
