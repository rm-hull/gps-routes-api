  "description": "This walk climbs to the excellent Garn Fawr viewpoint on the Pembrokeshire coast. You can start the walk from the car park to the east of the hill. From here you can follow a footpath west to the hill top where there are a number of rocky outcrops and an Iron Age Hillfort. It is still possible to make out much of the layout of the fort's ramparts. A little scramble is required to climb to the 213m (699 feet) summit where there are wonderful views over the surrounding coast and countryside. To the north you can see Strumble Head and Ramsey Island is also visible on a clear day. You can also look out for wildlife including buzzards and red kites in this lovely area.",
