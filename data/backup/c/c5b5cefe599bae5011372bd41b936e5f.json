  "description": "Enjoy an easy stroll along the towpath of the Huddersfield Broad Canal on this walk in Huddersfield. The canal runs from the town centre of Huddersfield and heads north to Bradley, passing a series of locks and old mill buildings on the way. You start off at Aspley Basin and head past Turnbridge Lift Bridge and Deighton before finishing at Bradley near Brighouse. Near the end of the route you'll pass the historic 18th-century Colne Bridge. The Grade II listed stone-built arch bridge spans the River Colne between Bradley and Kirkheaton. At Bradley you can pick up the Kirklees Way long distance footpath to extend your walk. You could head north to Hartshead or east towards Fixby along the path. The canal links also with the Calder and Hebble Navigation Canal at Bradley. In Huddersfield you can also pick up the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. It heads across the Pennines and the Peak District into Greater Manchester. For cyclists National Cycle Route 69 runs parallel to the canal.",
