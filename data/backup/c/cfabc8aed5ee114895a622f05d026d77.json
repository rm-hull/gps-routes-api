Today, the modern Konik horses are settling into their new homes at Stod Marsh and Ham Fen in Kent. They're already proving to be a great boost for the ecology of the area. Koniks help to keep the land open and give plants, birds and insects the chance to settle in an area."

  "description": "This delightful nature reserve near Canterbury boasts the largest reedbeeds in the South East of England. There are miles of well laid out footpaths taking you past the reedbeds, wet grazing meadows and lagoons where you will see a wide variety of wildlife. Look out for bearded reedlings, bitterns, marsh harriers, sandpipers, grebes, kingfishers and rare garganey ducks. You may also see water voles, weasels or even an otter. There are also several bird hides and an observation mound. The Stour Valley Walk also runs through the reserve so you could follow this footpath along the River Great Stour towards Canterbury which lies a few miles to the west of Stodmarsh. There's also the Grove Ferry Walk which starts at the eastern end of the reserve. Grove Ferry is a popular spot for starting walks in the area. You'll find a car park, picnic area, boat trips and a fine riverside pub here. At the western end of the reserve you'll also find the Westbere Marshes and the noteworthy town of Fordwich. Fordwich is notable as Britain's smallest town and also has a great pub with a dining terrace overlooking the Stour.",
