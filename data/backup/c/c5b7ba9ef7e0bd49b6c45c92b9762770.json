  "description": "This walk takes you to the highest waterfall in Britain. It starts at the Loch na Gainmhich car park about 3 miles from the falls, and follows a challenging footpath to the spectacular waterfall. The walk takes you past Loch na Gainmhich and a series of smaller lochs to the spectacular 658ft (200m) falls. From the high points on the walk there are wonderful views of Loch Glencoul, Loch Beag and the hills of Glas Bheinn and Quinag. The falls are located a few miles south of Kylesku where you can catch also boat trips to the falls. You can continue your walking in the area by heading a few miles south to visit Loch Assynt. Here you can visit the striking ruins of Ardvreck Castle which sits on a rocky promontory jutting out into the expansive loch.",

The splendid Knockan Crag Nature Reserve is well worth a visit. The site includes some spectacular limestone scenery with a variety of interesting plant species. There are also some lovely views of the adjacent Lochan an Ais to enjoy here."
