During the summer, tourists can use these dunes for Sandboarding."

  "description": "This popular walk follows a section of the South West Coast Path from Perranporth to Holywell Bay on the Cornish Coast. The route runs for 4.6 miles, with flat sections along the beach mixed with some small cliff top climbs. Start the walk from the public car park near Droskyn Point in the pretty village of Perranporth. You then head east and then north to Perranporth Beach, where there is a long expanse of beach and sand dunes. The walk then proceeds to Ligger Point and Penhale Point before descending into the little village of Holywell. From here it is a short stroll to the lovely National Trust owned bay and beach. The walk can be extended by continuing north to Crantock Beach and the popular tourist town of Newquay. Heading south will take you along the Perranporth to St Agnes Walk where there are more excellent views to enjoy.",
