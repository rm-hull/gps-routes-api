  "description": "This little West Yorkshire village is located in a nice rural spot near Huddersfield. It's a good place to start a walk with a decent waymarked trail, a popular local hill climb and a fine old pub for refreshment afterwards. This walk from the village ventures north to climb to the popular viewpoint at Castle Hill. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Holme Valley Circular Walk and follow the waymarked footpath north to Royd House Wood before crossing the Lumb Dyke. The route then ascends to the summit of Castle Hill where there's an ancient hill fort, the grade II listed Victoria Tower and wonderful views across Kirklees. If you look south you also get a good view back to Farnley Tyas.",
