  "description": "The Pentewan trail is a lovely traffic free cycle and walking path running from St Austell to Mevagissey. The trail follows National Cycle Route 3 along an old railway line and the St Austell River for part of the way and also includes a woodland section through King's Wood. There is also a short detour to the beautiful Lost Gardens of Heligan which boasts 200 acres of gardens including  Victorian Productive Gardens, romantic Pleasure Grounds, and a lush sub-tropical Jungle.  From Heligan the path descends to the finish point at the lovely harbour at Mevagissey. Also please note that at King's Wood there is the option of heading to the beach and harbour at Pentewan.",
