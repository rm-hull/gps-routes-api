  "description": "Explore the extensive parkland and gardens surrounding this lavish country mansion near Wimborne Minster in Dorset. Well laid out way-marked footpaths will take you across the wide lawns and through peaceful woodland to the beautiful Japanese Gardens with bamboo plants, granite lanterns and an authentic Japanese tea house. You can also follow the avenue of Lime trees to the arboretum known as Nursery Wood.\u00a0 Here you'll find a beautiful collection of azalea, camellia, rhododendron and flowering cherry trees.  Other features in Kingston Lacy Park include the restored Victorian Kitchen Garden, the ancient Egyptian obelisk, the Rose Garden, the South Terrace, the Parterre, the Fernery and the Cedar Walk. You can also explore the Italian style house with its collection of ancient Egyptian artefacts and paintings including pictures by Rubens and Van Dyck. If you have time you could also explore the wider estate which covers 8500 acres. Highlights include the nearby Badbury Rings Iron Age hill fort and the delightful two and a half mile long Beech Avenue. The Stour Valley Way long distance walking trail also runs past the estate so you could pick this up and follow the River Stour into Wimborne Minster.",
