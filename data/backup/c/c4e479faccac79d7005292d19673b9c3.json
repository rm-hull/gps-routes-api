  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk around these pretty woods near Barnsley. In the centre of the wood there's a lovely large pond with a stream and a number of trails taking you through the semi-natural broadleaf woodland. Look out for carpets of Bluebells in the spring and a variety of wildlife including skylarks, meadow pipits, woodpeckers and kestrels. There's a car park just off Woodhead Lane where you can start your walk. From here you can pick up a footpath to the pond and the rest of the site. The woods are also located very close to Wombwell train station too. There's lots of good options to extend your walking in this lovely area. Just to the north west there's Dovecliffe Woods and beyond that waterside paths along the River Dove and the Worsbrough Canal. If you follow the canal west you will soon come to the delightful Worsbrough Mill Country Park. The park includes a 17th Century working water mill set in 240 acres of parkland.",

It's a friendly pub with a good menu and an outdoor seating area. Right next to the pub you will also find the RSPB Dearne Valley. This 89-hectare wetlands nature reserve is a nice place to continue your walking in the area. You can find the pub on Everill Gate Lane with a postcode of S73 0YQ."
