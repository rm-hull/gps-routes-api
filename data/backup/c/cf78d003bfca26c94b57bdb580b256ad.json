  "description": "This delightful village near Cambridge has a pretty village green, lovely riverside walks and some fine old pubs to visit. This circular walk from the village takes you south along the River Cam to visit Milton Country Park on the northern outskirts of the city of Cambridge. You'll also visit the neighbouring village of Horningsea. The walk starts from the train station and heads a short distance down to the river. Here you can pick up the Fen Rivers Way and follow the waymarked trail south along the river to Milton Fen. Near here you can branch off to the west to visit Milton Country Park. This popular park includes 100 acres of lakes and gardens with multiple footpaths and cycle trails. After exploring the park you return to the river where you can cross to the other side and follow the Harcamlow Way north to Horningsea. The route continues north to Clayhithe where you cross over to return to Waterbeach.",

The popular walk explores the famous university, visiting several historic highlights on the way. If you head north along the river you will soon come to the delightful Wicken Fen. The reserve is a great place for walking and cycling with flowering meadows, reedbeds, waterways and an abundance of wildlife to see. The Lodes Way can also be picked up here. This circular walk or cycle follows National Cycle Route 11 through the Cambridgeshire Lodes, a series of ancient man made waterways created to link a series of Fenland villages to the River Cam. On the way it visits the Jacobean mansion of Anglesey Abbey. The historic site includes some beautiful gardens with ornate statues and herbaceous borders. To the west is neighbouring Cottenham where there's a pretty village green, picturesque old almshouses, quaint thatched cottages and a church dating back to the 15th century. You can also enjoy a walk along Cottenham Lode to Rampton which is also worth exploring. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cambridgeshire Walks page."
