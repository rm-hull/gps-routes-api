  "description": "This delightful village near Cambridge has a pretty village green, lovely riverside walks and some fine old pubs to visit. This circular walk from the village takes you south along the River Cam to visit Milton Country Park on the northern outskirts of the city of Cambridge. You'll also visit the neighbouring village of Horningsea. The walk starts from the train station and heads a short distance down to the river. Here you can pick up the Fen Rivers Way and follow the waymarked trail south along the river to Milton Fen. Near here you can branch off to the west to visit Milton Country Park. This popular park includes 100 acres of lakes and gardens  with multiple footpaths and cycle trails. After exploring the park you return to the river where you can cross to the other side and follow the Harcamlow Way north to Horningsea. The route continues north to Clayhithe where you cross over to return to Waterbeach.",
