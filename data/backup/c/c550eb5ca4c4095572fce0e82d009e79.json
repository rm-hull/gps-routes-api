  "description": "This long circular walk makes use of a series of waymarked trails to explore the countryside, woodland and rivers surrounding the Hertfordshire town of Harpenden. The walk starts in Harpenden where you first pick up the Nickey Line . The shared cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway track from Hemel Hempstead to Harpenden. This section of the path runs south west to Redbourn where you can pick up the Ver-Colne Valley Walk . This waymarked footpath will take you south east along the river to St Albans where you'll skirt the edge of Verulamium Park . The park is well worth exploring with it's lovely lake and the old roman walls of Verulamium still intact. From St Albans you turn north east to pick up a section of the Hertfordshire Way to take you to the hamlet of Childwickbury. You'll pass Childwickbury Manor which was the former home of director Stanley Kubrick. You continue east towards the village of Sandridge , passing along the edge of Heartwood Forest on the way. The forest includes over half a million trees, ancient woodland, wildflower meadows and miles of waymarked walks. Shortly after you pass Symondshyde Great Wood before coming to Wheathampstead where you can see the Devil's Dyke. Here you can see the remains of a prehistoric defensive ditch which lies at the east side of the village. The site is a candidate for the strongly defended place where Julius Caesar fought Cassivellaunus in 54 BC. At Wheathampstead you pick up the Lea Valley Walk and follow it along the River Lea back into Harpenden.",
