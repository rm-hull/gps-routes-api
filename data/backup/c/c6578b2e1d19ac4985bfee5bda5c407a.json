The word is correctly pronounced with a short \"i\" to rhyme with \"tinned\", it derives from the practice of using the prevailing wind to assist with the turn."

  "description": "This Nottinghamshire based market town is located just south of the city of Nottingham. The town is positioned next to the River Trent and includes a number of Victorian buildings and a medieval church. This walk follows a section of the Trent Valley Way east along the riverside path to Colwick Country Park and Holme Pierrepont Country Park . The parks are a lovely place for a stroll and include large lakes, meadows, the National Watersports centre and a nature reserve with lots of wildlife to see. The walk can be extended by continuing east along the river to visit the pretty villages of Radcliffe on Trent Shelford , Gunthorpe , Burton Joyce , Rolleston and Fiskerton . In Radcliffe you can try the Radcliffe on Trent Cliff Walk which takes you along an elevated tree lined path above the river. The area also includes the Rockley Memorial Park where you'll find lovely gardens in a peaceful setting.",
