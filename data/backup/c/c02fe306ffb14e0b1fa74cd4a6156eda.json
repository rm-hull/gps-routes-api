  "description": "A popular coastal walk from Whitby to the nearby village of Sandsend. It's about a 3 mile walk on a fairly flat path with splendid cliff top views and lovely beaches. The walk starts from the atmospheric ruins of Whitby Abbey. The abbey has a fascinating history stretching back to the 7th century. It overlooks the North Sea in a dramatic location on the East Cliff above Whitby. It's a very photogenic spot with the abbey ruins surrounded by coast, river and countryside. From the abbey you pick up the Cleveland Way and follow it west, crossing the Swing Bridge over the River Esk on the way. After crossing the bridge you turn north along Pier Road, passing the Magpie Cafe. The restaurant is well known for its excellent fish and chips which are considered one of the best in the county. The path then turns west along the promenade, passing the lovely Whitby Sands, the golf club and Upgang Beach before coming to Sandsend. The pretty fishing village includes a nice beach and lots of attractive cottages. The western side of the village is one of the most expensive areas to buy property on the Yorkshire Coast. On the beach you can explore the little rock pools and go fossil hunting before enjoying refreshments in one of the fine local cafes or pubs. After exploring Sandsend you can return to Whitby along the beach but please check the tide times before you do this. When the tide is out its a huge beach stretching out to the North Sea so you can walk out quite a bit for great views along the coast and back to the town. Mulgrave Woods is located right next to Sandsend and is a great place to extend the walk. There's miles of peaceful woodland trails taking you to becks, waterfalls and the interesting ruins of Mulgrave Castle. You could also continue along the Cleveland Way and visit Runswick Bay .  It's another lovely fishing village with a sandy beach, sheltered bay and pretty little cottages.",
