For some years now, despite initial protests from a powerful angling lobby, the Snowdon Star has been engaged in taking visitors on excursions along the lake from its base at Llanberis. It also provides a ferry service between the village and the Padarn Country Park."

  "description": "This country park in Snowdonia has a number of splendid way-marked walking trails to follow. There are 800 acres to explore through oak woodland and along lakeside paths. The beautiful Llyn Padarn is the centrepiece of the park. You can stroll along the lakeside or catch the Llanberis Lake Railway which runs along the easten edge of the lake. It's a splendid 1 hour  ride with views of the 13th century Dolbadarn Castle and the twin lakes of Llyn Padarn and Llyn Peris. Mount Snowdon, the highest peak in England and Wales makes a wonderful backdrop. To continue your walking in the area you could visit the spectacular Llanberis Waterfall. It is located just to the south of the country park and has a nice footpath running to the 100ft high falls. For splendid views of the area you could try the climb to Moel Eilio from Llanberis. For cyclists there's Lon Las Peris on the western side of the water. The surfaced trail runs along a tree lined path on the old railway line.",
