The railway between St Boswells and Kelso across Roxburgh Viaduct, about 70 feet above the River Teviot, was opened in 1850, although one pier of the viaduct had collapsed during its building in 1849. The viaduct has 14 arches and is built on a curve. At the foot of the piers, the cutwaters on the north side are extended to carry a footbridge across the river."

  "description": "This town in the Scottish Borders is a fine place for riverside walking. This circular walk takes you to the historic Roxburgh Castle and the Roxburgh Viaduct. The walk starts on Kelso Bridge where you can pick up the Borders Abbeys Way and follow it west to Roxburgh Castle. The ruined castle sits in a scenic location next to the River Teviot. The route continues south along the river to Roxburgh where you can cross the river on the impressive viaduct. The route then follows the line of the old railway north back to Kelso. To continue your walking around Kelso head just over a mile north to visit Stichill Linn . It's something of a hidden gem with peaceful woodland trails and a picturesque waterfall to see.",
