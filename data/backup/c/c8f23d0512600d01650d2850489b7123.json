The location is Lands End Road, at the top of a set of steps which lead down between the \"Elephant Boatyard\", and the \"Jolly Sailor\" pub. At high tide, it might not be possible to access the pub from this side; the \"official\" route is via another set of steps, beside the pub sign. Note the elegant bridge, and variety of moored yachts and cruisers."

  "description": "This Hampshire village is located on the River Hamble, near Southampton, in the borough of Eastleigh. Local walking highlights include the nearby River Hamble Country Park where there's some lovely woodland trails and the historic Manor Farm and Country Park to explore. You can reach the park by following the Strawberry Trail from the village. On the other side of the river there's Swanwick Lakes Nature Reserve where there's lots of easy paths and plenty of wildlife to see. This walk in the village visits the Bursledon Windmill. The Grade II* listed mill dates to 1814 and has been restored to working order. On certain days you can tour the windmill and then enjoy a stroll around Windmill Wood where there's a brass rubbing nature trail. There's also the old Chineham Barn, and the Hiltingbury Granary, an 18th century farm building.",
