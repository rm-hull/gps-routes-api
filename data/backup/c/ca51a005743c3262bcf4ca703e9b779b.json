  "description": "Enjoy wonderful views over Dorset's beautiful Marshwood Vale on this circular walk near Bridport. The walk visits the ancient hill forts of Lambert's Castle and Coney's Castle, making use of the Wessex Ridgeway and various other footpaths, bridleways and country lanes. It is an interesting and varied walk passing through heathland, acid grassland and woodland. The views across the Marshwood Vale to the coast are stunning on a clear day. The area is also rich in wildlife which includes meadow pipit, stonechat, green woodpecker, yellowhammer, willow warbler, redstart, tree creeper and nuthatch. The walk begins at the National Trust car park and heads to the 2500 year old Lambert's Castle. You then pick up the Wessex Ridgeway and head south to Coney's Castle. Public footpaths then take you to the pretty Fishpond Bottom with its lovely, tranquil pond. Shortly after you return to the finish point back at the car park.",
