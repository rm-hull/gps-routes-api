  "description": "This walk visits the Cefn Ila Woodlands near the town of Usk in Monmouthshire. The woods includes some peaceful trails with lots of wildlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for birds such as hawfinch and redstart. There's also an arboretum with specimen trees and evidence of an old Victorian garden which used to occupy the site. On the eastern side of the woods you can extend your outing on the Usk Valley Walk or visit the historic Usk Castle on the other side of the river.",
