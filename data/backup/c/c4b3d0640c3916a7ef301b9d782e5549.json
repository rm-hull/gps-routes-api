  "description": "Enjoy lovely waterside walking trails in this country park in Oundle, Northamptonshire. At Barnwell you will find several pretty lakes and meadows while the River Nene also runs through the park. Follow the nature trail and look out for Coot, Mallard, Mute Swan and Great Crested Grebe on the water. In the meadow you will find a variety of plantlife including Yorkshire Fog and Crested Dogs Tail and flowers such as Ox-Eye Daisy, Cowslip, Tufted Vetch, Knapweeds and Greater Burnet. The park has a visitor centre, cafe and play area. The Nene Way walking trail runs past the park so you could pick this up and follow the River Nene to continue your walk. Our Oundle River Nene Walk uses part of the trail and visits the pretty villages of Ashton and Cotterstock. The picturesque Oundle Mill and Barnwell lock can be located just to the south of the park. Barnwell is located about 8 miles from Peterborough . It is also not far from Kettering and Corby.",
