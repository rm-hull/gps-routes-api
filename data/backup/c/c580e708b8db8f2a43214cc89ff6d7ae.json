The 140 acre reservoir is a peaceful place for a walk and also has some good bird watching opportunites. Birds you may see include grey phalarope, dunlin, and ringed plover. To use the car park and do go bird watching at the lake you can purchase a permit from the Pitsford Fishing Lodge. See the link below for more details. Head about half a mile south of the reservoir and you can visit the nearby Ravensthorpe Reservoir .",

The historic 17th century pub is so named because of the village's connections with the Northamptonshire Witch Trials in the 1600s. They serve good quality dishes and have a garden area to sit out in. The pub is located in a fine spot, standing opposite the attractive ironstone Jacobean grammar school. You can find them on the High Street at postcode NN6 8PY for your sat navs. They are dog friendly."
