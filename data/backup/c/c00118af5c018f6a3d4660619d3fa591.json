  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll along the River Wylye on this waterside walk in the Wiltshire village of Great Wishford. You can start the walk at Stoford Bridge and then follow the riverside footpath to Serrington. It's a nice 1.5 mile stroll with lovely views across the countryside of the Wylye Valley. You can return the same way or head east at Serrington along the Chain Drove and then head south along the Monarch's Way to return you to the village. Just to the west of Serrington you will find Steeple Langford where you can visit the Langford Lakes Nature Reserve. You can also follow the Monarch's Way south west from Great Wishford to visit Grovely Wood. The expansive wood has miles of nice woodland walking and cycling trails to enjoy. The Salisbury Country Way also runs through the village. This long distance footpath takes you on a tour of the villages and countryside surrounding Salisbury. If you follow it north east you will soon come to the iconic Stonehenge. The River Wylye Valley Walk takes you along the whole length of the river.",
