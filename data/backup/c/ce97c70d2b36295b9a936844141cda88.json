  "description": "This peaceful area of ancient woodland is located just to the west of the village of Honley in Kirklees. There's a series of nice footpaths with some open fields around Honley Wood Bottom as well. From the high points there are also some good views over the surrounding countryside to enjoy. This circular walk starts from Hassocks Lane at the eastern end of the woods. Then pick up the trails heading south west towards Meltham Mills. Just a short hop south of the woods you'll find Meltham Mills Reservoir where you can extend the walk. The delightul Folly Dolly Falls are also nearby and well worth a visit. The woods are also popular with mountain bikers with some good jumps and burns to try.",
