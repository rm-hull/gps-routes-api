  "description": "This short walk celebrates Mordiford\u2019s fascinating Dragon legend, taking you through some lovely local countryside and woodland on the way. On the walk look out for a series of wonderful wooden sculptures which illustrate the tale of the dragon that once lived in Mordiford. There's also information panels with more details of the story and the local wildlife you can see on the way. To continue your walking in the area try the longer Mordiford Loop. Part of the walk also uses a section of the Wye Valley Walk. You could follow this waymarked trail south to visit neighbouring Fownhope which visits the bluebell woodland in Fownhope Park before heading to the adjacent Haugh Woods .",
