You start in Wells by the impressive cathedral and head west towards Cheddar passing the show caves and paper mill at Wookey Hole and the wonderful limestone nature reserve at Ebbor Gorge . The route continues through Rodney Stoke National Nature Reserve and Draycott Sleights Nature Reserve before coming to the spectacular Cheddar Gorge , voted the second greatest natural wonder in Britain. The next stage takes you through the lovely countryside at Compton Bishop before climbing across Wavering Down to Crook Peak where there are splendid views towards the coast.  The final section sees you cross Bleadon Hill and finish by the wharf at Uphill on Weston Bay in Weston-Super-Mare.",
