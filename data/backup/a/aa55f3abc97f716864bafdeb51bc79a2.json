The sheep gather to shade under trees like this in the park."

If you fancy a pub lunch head into nearby Cheriton and pay a visit to The Flower Pots. The attractive red brick building dates back to the 1830s when it was originally a farmhouse. They serve fine food and have a lovely large garden area to relax in. You can find them at Brandy Mount, SO24 0QQ. The pretty village is a pleasant place for a stroll too. There's a 13th century church some picturesque thatched cottages and the site of the Battle of Cheriton which took place as part of the English Civil War in 1544. This is located about a mile east of the village near Cheriton Wood where there's some peaceful woodland trails to enjoy."
