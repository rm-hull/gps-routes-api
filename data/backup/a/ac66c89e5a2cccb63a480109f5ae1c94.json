  "description": "This walk follows a section of the Cleveland Way between these two major towns on the Yorkshire coast. It's one of the finest stretches of coast in the country, with visits to Whitby Abbey, Robin Hood's Bay and Scarborough Castle to enjoy. It's a 21 mile walk along rugged coastline with some challenging climbs, so it's best to allow 2 days for completion. Highlights on the first section of the route include a visit to the atmospheric ruins of Whitby Abbey and the delightful fishing village of Robin Hood's Bay. The second leg of the trip runs from Robin Hood's Bay to Scarborough, passing Compton Cliff, Beast Cliff, Ravenscar and North Sands Beach before finishing at the remains of Scarborough Castle. This section also passes the delightful Hayburn Wyke Nature Reserve. The coastal reserve includes a lovely beach, a secluded cove, woodland trails and a pretty waterfall. It's a good place to stop for refreshments at the fine Hayburn Wyke Inn. To extend the walk continue along the Cleveland Way on the Scarborough to Filey Walk. It's another wonderful stretch of coast with more exhilarating cliff tops and great views. For an inland cycle route between the two towns see the Whitby to Scarborough Cycle Route .",
