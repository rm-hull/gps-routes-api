  "description": "This walk visits the Bleasdale Stone Circle in the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The circular walk starts at the church in the little village of Bleasdale, just to the south of the circle. Head north from here to Vicarage Farm and you can follow a track heading east to the circle. This Bronze Age circular earthwork is possibly aligned with the sunrise of the Summer Solstice. It's a very peaceful and picturesque spot to explore. The route then heads west back to the farm before turning north towards Admarsh Farm, Holme House and Hazelehurst. From here you turn south west to Clough Heads Wood before passing the Packhorse Bridge over the River Brock at Brooks and returning to Bleasdale.",
