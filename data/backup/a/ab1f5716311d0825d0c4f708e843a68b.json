  "description": "This shared cycling and walking route follows the Knowl Hill Bridleway around Wargrave and Twyford. The looped trail explores the woodland, hills, countryside and villages surrounding Knowl Hill. The route starts and finishes at Twyford just to the north of the train station. On the way you'll pass the villages of Burchett's Green, Littlewick Green and Waltham St Lawrence. There's some lovely views over the area from the high points on the circuit. The eastern side of the route passes close to Maidenhead Thicket which is well worth a small detour if you have time.",
