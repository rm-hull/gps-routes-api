  "description": "This attractive Cambridgeshire town has some delightful riverside paths and a wildlife rich local nature reserve to explore. The town is located on the southern outskirts of Huntingdon. This circular walk from the town uses sections of the Ouse Valley Way and the Pathfinder Long Distance Walk to visit the Godmanchester Nature Reserve and the neighbouring village of Houghton. The walk starts in the town where you can pick up the Ouse Valley Way and follow the waymarked path north east to the nature reserve. Here you'll find grassland, reedbed, willows and a series of pretty lakes formed from flooded gravel pits. It's a great place for wildlife with kingfisher and grazing wildfowl to see. Keep your eyes peeled for Great Crested Grebe, Teal, Tufted Duck and Wigeon on the water. The route continues along the river to Houghton where you can pay a visit to the historic Houghton Mill. The picturesque 18th-century watermill is run by the National Trust and sits in an idyllic location by the river. The route then heads south west to Hemingford Abbots before picking up the Pathfinder Long Distance Walk to return to the town.",
