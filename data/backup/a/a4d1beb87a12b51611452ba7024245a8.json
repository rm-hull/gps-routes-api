  "description": "A challenging circular walk in the Western Lakes which visits the pretty Seathwaite Tarn and the fine viewpoint at Dow Crag. The walk starts from the little village of Seathwaite in the\u00a0Duddon Valley\u00a0area of the South Lakeland District. Park at the car park in the village and start by heading north east up to the Walna Scar Road. The path then climbs to Walna Scar, Brown Pike, Blind Tarn and Buck Pike before coming to Dow Crag. The summit stands at a height of 778\u00a0m (2,552\u00a0ft) with great views of the\u00a0Scafells,\u00a0Skiddaw\u00a0and the\u00a0Helvellyn range. You are also just above the lovely Goat's Tarn and Blind Tarn which are very photogenic. After taking in the views you then descend to Seathwaite Tarn where there's a nice path along the western side of the water. The path then continues the descent to pretty Tarn Beck, which you follow back into Seathwaite. This walk is located very close to the Old Man of Coniston where you can extend your exercise. It lies just to the east of the Dow Crag summit and can be reached by following paths past Goat's Water from Goat's Hawse. See our Circular Walk around Coniston for more details. The 7 mile hike visits the Old Man summit before heading to Dow Crag, Buck Pike, Brown Pike and Walna Scar. Just to the west is the lovely climb to Harter Fell where there are more great views over the Duddon Valley and woodland trails through the adjacent Dunnerdale Forest.",
