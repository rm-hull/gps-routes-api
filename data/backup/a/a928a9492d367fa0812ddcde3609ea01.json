      "caption": "Ballysaggartmore Towers. Arthur Keily-Ussher, an Anglo-Irish landlord, constructed the estate no later than 1834. His extensive estate spanned approximately 8000 acres, with the majority leased to tenant farmers. However, he retained around 1000 acres for his personal demesne. In 1850, Keily-Ussher built The Towers, extravagant gates intended for his wife. These gates were meant to be part of a grand castle, but financial constraints halted further construction, leaving the gates as the sole completed structure. Consequently, the Kiely-Ussher family resided in a modest house on the grounds, which has since been demolished. The small castle that was initially planned was never finished and is not open to the public."

Local lore suggests that the grand entrance lodges were built as a prelude to an extravagant mansion that Arthur Keily-Ussher intended to construct. However, he never completed the mansion as he ultimately ran out of funds. The lore also claims that his building pursuits were motivated by his jealous wife, who envied her sister-in-law residing at the stately Strancally Castle. Nevertheless, no contemporary accounts from the period verify this story."

      "caption": "Controversy surrounds Arthur Keily-Ussher, who has been accused of being a harsh landlord and evicting tenants unable to pay their rents during the Great Famine (1845-1849). An attempt was even made on his life during this period. Keily-Ussher died around 1862, and the estate was sold by a liquidator. The house, gardens, and some of the lands were purchased by the Woodroofe family, and these were later owned by a family named Anson. The house was destroyed by an arson attack during the Civil War period, and the ruined stone fabric was removed in the mid-20th century. One of the lodges was still in use as a private residence in the 1970s. The lodges, although un-roofed, are still standing and surrounded by forested land. A walking trail encompassing them has been developed, along with a picnic and parking area nearby."
