  "description": "This forested area is located a few miles south west of Basingstoke and not far from Winchester. There's a number of good walking and cycling trails to try in the 270-hectare beech woods. It's also the home of Forest Holidays where you can hire a log cabin and stay over in the woods. The site includes a centre where you can hire mountain bikes or enjoy a meal in the cafe. You can start your exercise from the centre where there's parking available at postcode SO21 3BG for your sat navs. If you are coming by public transport then Micheldever train station is located just to the west of the forest. Other highlights in the forest include various woodland birds and pretty bluebells in the spring.",

If you fancy a pub lunch you could head into nearby Micheldever where there's a village green, picturesque thatched cottages and the noteworthy Half Moon & Spread Eagle inn. It's a typical village pub with a patio and a nice garden to sit out in on warmer days. There's a cosy interior with a wood-burning stove and ensuite B&B rooms if you need to stay over. The old drovers\u2019 inn dates back to 1703 and is in a nice position over looking the former cricket pitch. You can find them on Winchester Road with a postcode of SO21 3DG for your sat navs."

      "content": "Micheldever train station is located just a mile west of the forest so you could potentially come by public transport if you prefer. To continue your walking around the area you could head east and pick up the Wayfarer's Walk. This waymarked trail explores the countryside around Basingtoke. You could also try the Basingstoke Canal Walk or head into nearby Winchester and try the Winchester Circular Walk and the Winchester River Walk. For cyclists the Winchester to Basingstoke Cycle Route is a good option. Just to the south there's more pleasant wooded trails in Micheldever Woods. The woods are particularly popular in the spring when there are carpets of bluebells to see. On the southern side of Basingstoke there's the historic area of Old Basing. Here you'll find the 16th century Basing House, a Tudor Tithe Barn, Basingstoke Common and the Basing Lime Pits. There's also some more nice trails along the River Loddon in this area. Just south of Old Basing there's also Hackwood Park to explore. The Grade I listed park has a series of public footpaths taking you past the old estate which includes an ornamental bridge, fountains, a statue of George I, deer and the impressive Hackwood House. Just to the east of the park you can pick up the circular Mapledurwell Walk and visit the pretty villages of Mapledurwell and Upton Grey. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
