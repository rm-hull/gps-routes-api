The wood is an ancient woodland, part of Micheldever Forest, managed by the Forestry Commission to a 30 year plan."

  "description": "This forested area is located a few miles south west of Basingstoke and not far from Winchester. There's a number of good walking and cycling trails to try in the 270-hectare beech woods. It's also the home of Forest Holidays where you can hire a log cabin and stay over in the woods. The site includes a centre where you can hire mountain bikes or enjoy a meal in the cafe. You can start your exercise from the centre where there's parking available at postcode SO21 3BG for your sat navs. If you are coming by public transport then Micheldever train station is located just to the west of the forest. Other highlights in the forest include various woodland birds and pretty bluebells in the spring.",
