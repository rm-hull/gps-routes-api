Affectionately known as 'the Jolly' by the locals, it has been a place of rest and recreation for seafarers and travellers alike for centuries. Inside the main beam in the pub was taken from a French ship of the line at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The ship was captured and renamed The Indefatigable. When she was later broken up, the landlord of the time arranged for the beam to be installed in the main bar and it remains there to this day. The pub has been refurbished to a very high standard, making it one of the most pleasant, as well as the most characterful of places to drink or stay in the town. You can find the pub on Princes Square, Looe at postcode PL13 2EP.In nearby Polperro the delightful Blue Peter Inn is another must see pub. Nestled between ancient smugglers cottages on the harbour and Fish Quay, just a few yards from the beach 'The Blue' (as it is affectionately known) is one of the quaintest pubs you may ever come across.
