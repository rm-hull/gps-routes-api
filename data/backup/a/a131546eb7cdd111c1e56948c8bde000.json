  "description": "Walk along the golden sands of the Northumberland Coast, on this walk from Seahouses to the striking Bamburgh Castle. It's a lovely setting with the path running along the beach with the castle making a wonderful backdrop for the duration of the walk. There's also attractive sand dunes, pretty wildflowers and great views over to the nearby Farne Islands. Starting from Seahouses Harbour it's about a 3 mile walk to the castle along the beach. It's a nice flat, easy walk with a short climb up to the Grade I listed castle. The castle is open to the public and well worth a visit if you have time. There's fine state rooms, an art gallery, a stable block and a 12th century keep which is the oldest surviving part of the castle. To extend your walking in the area you can head south on the Seahouses to Beadnell Walk. The St Oswald's Way long distance trail also passes through the area. You could follow it north and visit the Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve. Here you can look out for grey seals and birds including pale-bellied brent goose, wigeon, teal, pintail, merlin, dunlin, bar-tailed godwit. Just north from the castle is the lovely Budle Bay. You can explore the area on our Bamburgh to Budle Bay Circular Walk which starts at the castle.",
