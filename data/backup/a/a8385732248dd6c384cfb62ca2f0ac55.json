  "description": "This town in County Durham includes the grounds of a splendid old hall, a pleasant town park and easy walks along the River Weardale Way. This circular walk from the town visits two of the walking highlights of the area at the Auckland Walk and Whitworth Hall Country Park. The walk starts in the town centre in the pretty Victoria Jubilee Park. There's some nice trails here with a landscaped mini crazy golf course and a sensory garden. Just south of here you can pick up the Auckland Walk, a shared cycling and walking trail, running along the old railway line. Follow the trail west before turning east along Hagg Lane to take you towards Whiteworth Hall. The parkland surrounding the old hall includes woodland trails, a lovely lake and resident deer which you can hand feed. From here it is a short walk south to return to the town centre.",
