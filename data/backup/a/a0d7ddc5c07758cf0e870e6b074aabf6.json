  "description": "The 1,072 hectare (2,650 acre) Stourhead estate has miles of lovely walking trails to try. You can follow the well surfaced footpaths around the stunning lake and into the surrounding woodlands, parkland and gardens. There is a collection of exotic trees which look wonderful in the autumn months. You'll also pass some classical architecture including temples, mystical grottoes and the beautiful arched bridge over the lake. If you would like to extend your walking in the area then you could follow the Stour Valley Way south towards Bourton. The waymarked, long distance trail can also be used to create a circular walk around the estate. The Leland Trail also starts at Stourhead so you could pick this up and visit King Alfred's Tower. To extend your walk you could climb White Sheet Hill for wonderful views over the Cranborne Chase AONB. You can virtually explore Stourhead using the google street view link below!",
