  "description": "This historic Herefordshire based village is a lovely place for a stroll. The former market town includes a number of photogenic timber framed buildings and a noteworthy Norman church. This circular walk from the village visits the ruined castle at Garnstone Park before heading to the neighbouring settlement of Ledgemoor. On the way there's some pleasant countryside views, medieval buildings and two pretty lakes to see. There's also an optional extension to visit The Ley, a Grade-I listed farmhouse dating to 1589 which lies just to the west of the village. Weobley is on the Black and White Village Trail, a long distance circular walk which visits several of Herefordshire's medieval settlements. You could extend your walking in the area by following the waymarked footpath north east to visit Dilwyn and Leominster. Heading west will take you to Woonton, Logaston and Almeley.",
