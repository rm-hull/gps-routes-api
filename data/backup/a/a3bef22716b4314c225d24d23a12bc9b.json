The historic cottage was Coleridge's home during the late 18th century. The site is now run by the National Trust so you can enjoy a tour of the house and learn all about the life of the famous writer. It was during his three years here that he wrote his finest works, including 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', 'Kubla Khan', 'Frost at Midnight', 'Christabel' and 'This Lime Tree Bower my Prison'. The Ancient Mariner pub is named after his famous poem and a nice place to enjoy a drink before you set off."

Coleridge was a key figure in the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets, alongside his close friend William Wordsworth. Coleridge\u2019s poetry and prose had a profound impact on English literature. Among his most celebrated works are the poems \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and \"Kubla Khan\", both of which exemplify his innovative use of language and imagination. He also authored the major prose work \"Biographia Literaria\", where he offered his critical insights, especially on Shakespeare, and engaged deeply with German philosophy, introducing ideas from German idealism to English-speaking audiences. Coleridge coined enduring phrases like \"suspension of disbelief\", a term that describes the reader\u2019s willingness to set aside scepticism in order to immerse in a story. His critical contributions were influential on writers and thinkers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement in the United States."

      "caption": "Monksilver countryside. Despite his literary genius, Coleridge suffered from severe anxiety and depression throughout his life, conditions that were potentially linked to bipolar disorder (though not identified as such during his time). His health issues, exacerbated by opium addiction (fostered by the use of laudanum for pain relief), deeply affected his personal and professional life. Although Coleridge faced a turbulent career and life, his influence continued to grow posthumously, and today he is considered one of the most significant figures in English Romanticism. His legacy is celebrated in events like Coleridge Day by institutions such as the Church of England."
