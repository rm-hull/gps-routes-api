The historic cottage was Coleridge's home during the late 18th century. The site is now run by the National Trust so you can enjoy a tour of the house and learn all about the life of the famous writer. It was during his three years here that he wrote his finest works, including 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', 'Kubla Khan', 'Frost at Midnight', 'Christabel' and 'This Lime Tree Bower my Prison'. The Ancient Mariner pub is named after his famous poem and a nice place to enjoy a drink before you set off."

Coleridge was a key figure in the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets, alongside his close friend William Wordsworth. Coleridge\u2019s poetry and prose had a profound impact on English literature. Among his most celebrated works are the poems \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and \"Kubla Khan\", both of which exemplify his innovative use of language and imagination. He also authored the major prose work \"Biographia Literaria\", where he offered his critical insights, especially on Shakespeare, and engaged deeply with German philosophy, introducing ideas from German idealism to English-speaking audiences. Coleridge coined enduring phrases like \"suspension of disbelief\", a term that describes the reader\u2019s willingness to set aside scepticism in order to immerse in a story. His critical contributions were influential on writers and thinkers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement in the United States."

      "caption": "Monksilver countryside. Despite his literary genius, Coleridge suffered from severe anxiety and depression throughout his life, conditions that were potentially linked to bipolar disorder (though not identified as such during his time). His health issues, exacerbated by opium addiction (fostered by the use of laudanum for pain relief), deeply affected his personal and professional life. Although Coleridge faced a turbulent career and life, his influence continued to grow posthumously, and today he is considered one of the most significant figures in English Romanticism. His legacy is celebrated in events like Coleridge Day by institutions such as the Church of England."

  "description": "Travel through the Exmoor National Park and the stunning Quantocks Hills as you walk in the footsteps of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. You start off in the pretty village of Nether Stowey, at the foot of the Quantock Hills and head west towards Holford, passing the iron age fort of Dowsborough on the way. You continue through a wooded section at Alfroxton Woods and onto Stowborrow Hill with its resident deer before passing through Bicknoller and Monksilver where you enter Combe Sydenham Country Park. Here you will find a 15th century stately home set in a 500 acres estate which includes a Deer Park and a variety of walks. The route continues through the Brendon Hills climbing to the high point of Lype Hill (1,388 ft) with wonderful views over the Exmoor National Park. You'll pass the villages of Luxborough and Cutcombe before climbing Horner Hill and passing the delightful Dunkery and Horner Woods Nature Reserve where you can enjoy a climb to Dunkery Beacon. The path then descends to the pretty coastal settlements of Porlock and Porlock Weir where there's a delightful harbour and beach. The route continues west past Culbone Wood, Leeford and Alderford before coming to another route highlight at Watersmeet with its fine house, woodland trails and waterfalls along the East Lyn River. The final section then takes you through Wester Wood before finishing in Lynton and Lynmouth .",
