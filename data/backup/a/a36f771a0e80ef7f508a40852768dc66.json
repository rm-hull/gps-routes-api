  "description": "This walk visits the beautiful estate surrounding the 16th century Helmingham Hall in Suffolk. The hall is particularly noted for its stunning gardens which are open to the public from May to September. Features include herbaceous borders, tree lined avenues, a\u00a0rose garden, a\u00a0knot garden, a\u00a0parterre, a\u00a0walled garden and an orchard. There's also a deer park and nice views of the surrounding countryside. If the hall is closed then there are some pleasant public footpaths you can follow around the side of the estate. With these you can create a circular walk passing the old St Mary's Church and the lake. The village of Helmingham is located just a few miles to the east of Needham Market where you could extend your walking around the lovely Needham Lake . The village of Coddenham and the Gipping Valley River Path can also be explored in this area.",
