  "description": "These woods in Eastleigh have some nice cycling and walking trails to try. In the spring months there's also lots of bluebells to see. Enter the woods on Stoke Park Road at the western side of the site where there is a small car park. From here you pick up a selection of cycle trails and footpaths to take you around the woods. On the eastern side of the woods you can enjoy refreshments at the Fox and Hounds pub at Pylehill. The Itchen Way passes the western side of the woods. You can pick up the riverside trail and follow it north toward Winchester or south towards Southampton.",
