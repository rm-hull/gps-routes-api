  "description": "This circular walk from the West Yorkshire village of Harden takes you along the Harden Beck to two of the area's highlights at Goit Stock Waterfall and Hewenden Reservoir . The walk starts in the village and follows a road south to meet up with the beck. You can then pick up a footpath heading west past the old Mill to Crag Wood and Goit Stock Waterfall. It's a lovely spot with the picturesque falls tucked away in a delightful grotto. The route then picks up the Bradford Millennium Way and\n continues past the impressive Hewenden Viaduct before coming to Hewenden Reservoir and Gleid Hill. You can then follow trails around the reservoir to Buck Park. The route then heads north, passing Hallas Hall Farm before returning to the village. You can extend the walk by continuing south to visit Doe Park Reservoir , home to Doe Park Water Activities Centre where you can try a variety of water based activities.",
