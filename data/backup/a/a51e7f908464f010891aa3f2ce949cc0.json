  "description": "This historic 13th century priory is located close to Coalville in North West Leicestershire. It's a pleasant place for an easy walk with the photogenic ancient ruins surrounded by some attractive woodland trails. In the woods there's views of the Grace Dieu Brook and in the spring lots of pretty Wood Anenome's can be seen too. One nice idea is to combine this walk with a visit to Mount St Bernard Abbey . The abbey lies just to the south east of the priory and can be reached by picking up the Ivanhoe Way at the southern end of the woods. Follow the waymarked trail east and it will take you past Whitwick to the abbey. Near here there's also Blackbrook Reservoir where you'll find some pleasant waterside trails to try.",
