  "description": "A super walk with a series of delightful waterside sections along the River Lea. The walk runs from Leagrave, the source of the River Lea near Luton , to the Thames at Limehouse Basin, east London. You follow a riverside path for much of the way through, Luton, Hatfield, Hertford , Ware and Cheshunt with a swan emblem clearly waymarking the walk. The walk passes Nature Reserves, pretty riverside villages and includes a section through the fantastic Lee Valley Park - London's largest open space. You'll also pass the Olympic Park in Stratford which is well worth exploring. The final section of the walk runs along the Limehouse Cut Canal which is also suitable for cyclists. In the Lee Valley park you can also pick up the Stort Navigation and follow the towpath to Bishop's Stortford. The river also runs parallel to the New River Path around Hertford and Ware so it's possible to create a circular walk using both the footpaths in this area.",
