  "description": "This circular walk on the Devon coast explores the area around Thurlestone village. On the way you'll visit Thurlestone Sands beach and Bantham, while enjoying wonderful views over Bigbury Bay. There's also some wonderful geology and nice views of the South Milton Ley River which runs just east of the beach. The walk starts at the National Trust car park at South Milton Sands. The area is a popular place with a beautiful beach, rock pools and fine views of the Thurlestone Rock archway. From here you can pick up a section of the epic South West Coast Path and follow the waymarked footpath north towards Bantham, passing Warren Point, Loam Castle and Leas Foot Sand on the way. You'll head along the dunes at Bantham Sands before turning south to Thurlestone village and the golf course.",
