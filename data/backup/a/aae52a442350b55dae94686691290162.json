  "description": "This large village in West Sussex has some nice riverside and country trails to try. It's also close to the South Downs National Park which can be reached on foot on a handy waymarked trail runnning through the village. The village has an attractive centre with a historic 13th century church, a 17th century pub and the photogenic Cat House with its thatched roof. This route from Henfield uses a section of the Downs Link and riverside trails to create a circular walk around the area. The route starts on the western side of the village where you can pick up the Downs Link. This shared cycling and walking trail can be followed north to Betley Bridge on the River Adur. You can then follow a pleasant riverside footpath south to Bineham Bridge and Stretham Manor. Here you can pick up the Downs Link again and follow the trail north back into Henfield.",

      "subtitle": "Dog Walking",
      "content": "The country and river trails are a nice one to do with your dog. The Downs Link path is shared with cyclists and horse riders so you will need to keep them under control on this section. The Plough mentioned above is also dog friendly with biscuit treats and bowls of water available."

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "Head south of the village and you can pick up the River Adur and Bramber Castle Walk. There's more nice trails and interesting villages around the historic 11th century castle. In this area you can also visit the attractive market town of Steyning. The neighbouring town is worth exploring with a fine high street and a number of Tudor style half timbered houses and smart Georgian town houses to see. If you continue south along the river you will soon come to the coast at Shoreham by Sea. If you continue north on the Downs Link then you can visit the lovely Southwater Country Park. There's good footpaths here around a series of pretty lakes with lots of wildlife to look out for on the way. Just south of here is the expansive Knepp Castle Estate. The estate is one of the walking highlights of the area with miles of trails, a 12th century castle and interesting wildlife including wild boar, nesting storks, horses and deer to look out for on the way. For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks page."
