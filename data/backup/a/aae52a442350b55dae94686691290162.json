  "description": "This large village in West Sussex has some nice riverside and country trails to try. It's also close to the South Downs National Park which can be reached on foot on a handy waymarked trail runnning through the village. The village has an attractive centre with a historic 13th century church, a 17th century pub and the photogenic Cat House with its thatched roof. This route from Henfield uses a section of the Downs Link and riverside trails to create a circular walk around the area. The route starts on the western side of the village where you can pick up the Downs Link. This shared cycling and walking trail can be followed north to Betley Bridge on the River Adur. You can then follow a pleasant riverside footpath south to Bineham Bridge and Stretham Manor. Here you can pick up the Downs Link again and follow the trail north back into Henfield.",
