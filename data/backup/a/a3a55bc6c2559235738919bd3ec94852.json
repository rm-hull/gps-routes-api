  "description": "A woodland walk along the River Teign from Fingle Bridge to Steps Bridge via Clifford Bridge. Along the way you'll pass through Fingle Woods and the Dunsford Nature Reserve where there are many different types of butterfly to look out for in the summer months. Start the walk from the Fingle Bridge car park next to the 17th-century stone arch bridge. The trail heads east along the river, passing the Iron Age Hillfort of Woolston Castle. You soon come to Clifford Bridge where you can cross the river and follow paths through Dunsford Nature Reserve. It's a lovely area with oak woodland glades and bluebells and daffodils in the spring months. Look out for wildlife including butterflies and fallow deer in this area. At the end of the reserve you'll find the route end at Steps Bridge. You can return the same way or cross the river and follow alternative trails through Cod Wood. To continue your walking in the area visit the splendid Castle Drogo, just to the west of the car park. You can follow the Hunters Path through a beautiful gorge and visit the wider estate surrounding the country house.",

You can find the inn right next to the old bridge at postcode EX6 6PW for your sat navs."
