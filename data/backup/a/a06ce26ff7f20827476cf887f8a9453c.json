  "description": "This walk climbs to Machen Mountain (Mynydd Machen) in South Wales. The route uses sections of the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk and the Raven Walk to create a circular walk to the summit from Sirhowy Valley Country Park. The walk starts from the Sirhowy Valley Country Park car park, just west of Risca and north of Machen village. Head south west from here and you can pick up the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk and follow the waymarked path south east up to Machen Mountain. The summit stands at a height of 362 metres (1,188 ft) and is crowned by a trig point and a mast. There's splendid views over the beautiful countryside and hills surrounding the area. You can also see across the Rhymney Valley, Cardiff and the Bristol Channel on a clear day. After taking in the views you can descend to the north to Danygraig Quarry where you can pick up the Raven Walk. This will take you west back to the country park where a woodland section through Black Vein returns you to the car park. The hill and surrounding common are also popular with bike riders as there are a number of good trails to try. See the video below for an example of the mountain bike trails and scenery of the area.",
