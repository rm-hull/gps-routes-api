  "description": "A long walk from Lewes to Eastbourne taking in some of the loveliest South Downs scenery. The route runs for about 20 miles, beginning with a riverside walk along the River Ouse to Southease where you pick up the South Downs Way . You can then follow the long distance trail all the way to Eastbourne, passing Firle Beacon , Alfriston , the Cuckmere River, the Long Man of Wilmington , Windover Hill and Jevington. There's much to enjoy with riverside trails, wonderful views to the coast from the high points and a nice coastal section into Eastbourne at the end. This section of the downs is great for flora and fauna with lots of pretty heather and wildflowers to see. You can also look out for wildlife including the delightful Exmoor Ponies. While the start and end of the route are quite flat, there are some quite challenging hill climbs along the way. In Eastbourne you have lots of good options for continuing your walking. You can try the Eastbourne to Beachy Head Walk which takes you to the highest chalk sea cliff in Britain. Near here there's also the splendid Birling Gap and the Belle Tout Lighthouse.",
