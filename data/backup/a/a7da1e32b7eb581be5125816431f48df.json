  "description": "The Jodrell Bank telescope is an iconic structure located near Holmes Chapel in Cheshire. As well as a fascinating discovery centre there is also a pretty 35 acre arboretum with lovely walking trails. Trees include crab apple and the mountain ash Sorbus species. There is also a small-scale model of the solar system and great views of the famous Lovell telescope. In the discovery centre you can find out about the solar system with fascinating interactive displays and games. There is also good facilities with a car park and cafe. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Dane Valley Way which runs through Holmes Chapel.",

      "content": "Just a few miles to the east you'll find the pretty Redesmere Lake. There's some nice waterside trails and the historic Capesthorne Hall in this area. The Holmes Chapel Walk starts from the nearby village. It will take you along the River Dane to the Swettenham Meadows Nature Reserve and the Brereton Heath Local Nature Reserve where there are lots of wildlife spotting opportunites. Just a few miles to the west there's Lower Peover where you can visit the Grade I listed church and enjoy a walk to Peover Hall. The 16th century country manor includes beautiful gardens which are open to the public on certain days. Just over a mile south of the village there's something of a hidden gem at Shakerley Mere. The pretty lake includes a 1 mile circular trail, lots of wildlife and pleasant woodland trails. There's also a fine 300 year old pub for refreshments after your exercise. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cheshire Walks page."
