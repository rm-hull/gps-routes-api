  "description": "This West Yorkshire market town is located in the Wakefield area of the county. There's some nice country trails and a series of nearby reservoirs to visit in the area. To the west there's also some riverside trails along the River Calder and the Kirklees Way near Dewsbury. This walk from the town follows a section of the Leeds Country Way north to visit West Ardsley and Ardsley Reservoir. You can start the walk on the northern side of the town and then follow the waymarked trail north to lake. Here you 'll find a nice circular walk running around the perimeter.",
