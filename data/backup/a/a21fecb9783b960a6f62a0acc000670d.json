  "description": "This peaceful cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway track from West Meon to Wickham via Droxford. There are splendid views of the beautiful Meon Valley and the River Meon to enjoy as well as a variety of wildlife including butterflies, redwing and egrets. The route is reasonably flat, running along a surfaced path for just under 10 miles. Near Wickham the route skirts the edge of the Forest of Bere. You can pick up the trails in the West Walk area of the forest to extend your exercise. Our Meonstoke Walk and West Meon Walk use part of the trail to take you on a tour of the area surrounding the villages. There's some splendid views of the South Downs countryside which surrounds the trail.",

It has some history having originally been \u201cThe Old Curio Shop\u201d, an open hall timber framed building dating back to the sixteenth Century. Inside there are medieval paintings with floral/geometric patterns preserved behind glass and still on display. They do lovely home cooked food which you can enjoy in the pretty garden area if the weather is fine. You can find the pub on Wickham Square with a postcode of PO17 5JN for your sat navs. In Meonstoke there's the Bucks Head to investigate. The quaint inn is located in a fine spot close to the river and boasts a lovely garden area. You can find them on Shoe Lane, Exton with a postcode of SO32 3NT."

The walk first follows the old railway line along the River Meon before heading to the countryside and woodland of the Forest of Bere. It's a nice varied walk and a good way to explore the surrounding area. For more walking ideas in the area see the South Downs Walks page."
