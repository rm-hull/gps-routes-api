  "description": "This peaceful cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway track from West Meon to Wickham via Droxford . There are splendid views of the beautiful Meon Valley and the River Meon to enjoy as well as a variety of wildlife including butterflies, redwing and egrets. The route is reasonably flat, running along a surfaced path for just under 10 miles. Near Wickham the route skirts the edge of the Forest of Bere . You can pick up the trails in the West Walk area of the forest to extend your exercise. Our Meonstoke Walk and West Meon Walk use part of the trail to take you on a tour of the area surrounding the villages. There's some splendid views of the South Downs countryside which surrounds the trail.",
