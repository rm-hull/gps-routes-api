  "description": "This delightful area next to the River Stour is a lovely place to begin walk. There's a car park, picnic area and a popular pub for post walk refreshments here. This route from the site uses sections of the Wantsum Walk and the Stour Valley Walk to create a figure of eight loop walk through the surrounding countryside. On the way you'll explore the lovely Stodmarsh National Nature Reserve and visit the pretty village of Chislet. The route starts off at the Grove Ferry Picnic Site where there is a car park. The route then follows the Wantsum Walk to Upstreet and Chislet on the northern side of the river. After returning to Grove Ferry you then explore the Stodmarsh Nature Reserve where there are nice trails along the River Stour and an abundance of wildlife to look out for.",

At the western end of the reserve you'll also find the Westbere Marshes and the noteworthy town of Fordwich. Fordwich is notable as Britain's smallest town and also has a great pub with a dining terrace overlooking the Stour. The Wickhambreaux Walk starts from the nearby village and visits Grove Ferry. It will additionally take you through the Newnham Valley which lies just to the east. Here you can enjoy a walk along the Little Stour, a tributary of the Great Stour. The village is also well worth exploring with its 13th-century parish church, clapboard mill with working water wheel and a medieval village green."
