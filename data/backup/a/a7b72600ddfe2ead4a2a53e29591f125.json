  "description": "This walk takes you along the coast path from Penzance to Marazion. It's about a 3 mile walk, running along the beach between the two Cornish settlements. You start off at the train station at Penzance and head east along the waymarked St Michaels Way to Marazion. Here you can pay a visit to St Michael's Mount where you'll find a 12th century medieval church and castle on an island which is reachable from Marazion by a man-made causeway of granite setts, passable between mid-tide and low water. Also in the area is the lovely Marazion Marsh RSPB reserve where you can look out for a variety of wildlife.",
