In spring and summer, marsh harriers, kingfishers, water rails, and reed and sedge warblers can be seen in this small nature reserve which can be accessed via a circular walk which starts and ends by St Mary's church. Dogs are only allowed on public footpaths and bridleways. A great variety of wild flowers and plants, some of these rare such as marsh orchids and mild parsley, can be seen and in order to maintain and improve diversity, Highland Cattle is grazed here during the summer months. The site floods in winter, attracting bitterns, gadwalls and shovelers."

      "caption": "View north along the River Yare. This view was taken from the Wherryman's Way, a 35-mile long distance footpath following the route of the Broads trading wherries between Norwich and Great Yarmouth. The route takes its name from the wherry \u0096 a large cargo-carrying barge whose black sails used to be a common sight on these waters. Ten circular village walks branch off this path along the way. This section of the long distance footpath follows the course of the River Yare. The River Yare rises south of Dereham. It flows eastwards, skirting the southern edge of the city of Norwich. At Whitlingham it is joined by the River Wensum and just before reaching Reedham it is joined by the River Chet. Once past Reedham the river passes long stretches of marshland before it enters the tidal lake of Breydon Water where it is joined by the Rivers Bure and Waveney, and finally flows into the North Sea at Gorleston just south of Great Yarmouth."

During the 1800s the building was used as a coal depot and as a court house for the collection of tithes, and from the early 1900s onwards it has been an inn. The ferry operation ceased at around 1939 after a collision with a coaster."

  "description": "This Norfolk Broads village is a super place for a walk with river trails, broads and a fine local nature reserve to explore. This circular walk from the village explores the RSPB Church Marsh Nature Reserve and Surlingham Staithe on the edge of Surlingham Broad. The walk starts from the car park at the nature reserve, just to the north west of the village. From here you can pick up footpaths heading along the River Yare through the reserve. The site is great for flora and fauna with a wide variety of wildflowers and bird species to look out for. Keep your eyes peeled for Hobby, Marsh Harrier, Sedge Warbler and Kingfisher as you make your way through the area. At the Ferry House you leave the river and head closer to the adjacent Surlingham Staithe. The route then heads into the village before returning to the car park, passing the ruined old church on the way.",
