  "description": "Explore Knighton Wood and Lord Bushes on this short walk in the Buckhurst Hill area of Epping Forest. It's a lovely area for a peaceful stroll with nice footpaths taking you to rhododendron, oak and ash woodland. There's also tranquil ponds and the pretty Knighton Lake. You can park at the car park off Knighton Lane to start your walk. Then pick up the waymarked circular path called the Rowan Trail. The flat path runs for about 1.5 miles around the lake and the woods. Look out for pretty bluebells, violets and the Speckledwood Butterfly as you make your way around the site. If you would like to extend your walk then you could head west and pick up the Epping Forest Centenary Walk. Follow it north and you will soon come to the delightful Connaught Water with its surfaced waterside path. Knighton Wood is located very close to Roding Valley station where you can pick up the River Roding Walk which will take you through the pretty Roding Valley.",

The challenging trail visits Ambresbury Banks Iron Age Fort and a Deer Sanctuary near the village. There's also the Loughton Walk which explores the area from the nearby town's London Underground station. It's an attractive place worthy of exploration with dozens of historic listed buildings and three conservation areas. The route also visits the Roding Valley Meadows nature reserve on the River Roding."
