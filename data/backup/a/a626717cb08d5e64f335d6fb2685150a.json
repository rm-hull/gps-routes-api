The lido is a popular place for waterside walks with an artificial beach and super Mini gauge railway as well. Bayhurst Wood Country Park and Ruislip Woods are located next to the lido and have some nice peaceful woodland trails to explore on foot or by bike. The Colne Valley Trail runs just west of the route. This shared cycling and walking trail will take you through the River Colne valley, visiting several pretty lakes and the nearby Denham Country Park on the way."
