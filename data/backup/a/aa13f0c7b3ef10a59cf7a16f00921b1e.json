  "description": "This town in Powys sits in a pleasant location on the River Lugg, next to the border with England. It's a great place for walkers with the rolling hills of Shropshire, Herefordshire and Powys to explore. There's also an historic High Street with attractive 18th and 19th century shop fronts to see. This circular walk from the town explores the footpaths and country lanes to the east of the settlement. On the way there's some lovely countryside and views of the River Lugg which flows through the area. On the way you'll also skirt around the England-Wales border, crossing into Herefordshire at the eastern end of the route. The walk starts in the town and heads north, crossing the old stone Lugg Bridge over the river. You can then follow footpaths east, passing the waterfall and weir on the Lugg. At Middlemoor you pick up a pleasant country lane and follow it east with nice views of the rolling hills. At Kinsham Cross you head south, crossing the river again at Rosser's Bridge. You then turn west to Broad Heath Common before a final riverside path takes you back into Presteigne.",
