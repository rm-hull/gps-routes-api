  "description": "Enjoy 137 acres of woodland and open hilltop with magnificent views across the Anker Valley. It's particularly lovely in the springtime when there are carpets of bluebells to enjoy. It's also good for wildlife with plenty of woodland birds to look out for on the walk. For cyclists there are also some good mountain bike (mtb) trails to try. There's good facilities with a car park and a visitor centre with information on the trails in the park. The Coventry Canal runs just past the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along this splendid waterway.",
