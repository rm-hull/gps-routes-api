  "description": "This delightful arboretum has a series of good footpaths to follow around the site. There's 80 acres (32 ha) to explore with lakes, ponds and a waterside stroll along the pretty Hoor Brook. Look out for an extraordinary 10000 species of tree and shrub as you make your way through the area. The park also has an interesting history as one of the oldest parks in the borough, being originally opened in 1874. There's a car park at the south eastern end of the park off Broadway North. From here you can pick up the surfaced paths through the park to Hatherton Lake at the other end. The park hosts a popular parkrun every Saturday morning at 9:00 am. It's easy to extend your walk by visiting the nearby Park Lime Pits. The park incldues ponds, woodland, streams and over 300 species of plants. Here you can also pick up the Beacon Way long distance trail and enjoy a waterside walk along the Wyrley and Essington Canal. Just to the north is the pretty Mill Lane Nature Reserve with ponds and the Ford Brook running through it. Just to the west you will find the Walsall Canal where you can enjoy a walk or cycle along the towpath.",

The beacon is one of the highlights of the Black Country and a high point of the Birmingham city area. On the summit there is a distinctive domed war memorial and excellent views over the city and beyond. For more walking ideas in the area see the West Midlands Walks page."
