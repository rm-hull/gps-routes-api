  "description": "This pretty Warwickshire village sits on the edge of the Cotswolds, just south of Stratford Upon Avon. The attractive area includes the sister village of Lower Quinton where you'll find a noteworthy inn dating back to the 1500s. This route from the village uses sections of the Monarch's Way and the Heart of England Way to create a circular walk through the surrounding countryside. On the way you'll pass Meon Hill, the neighbouring village of Mickleton, the lovely Kiftsgate Court gardens and the splendid Hidcote Manor Garden. The route runs for nearly 8 miles, including a moderate hill climb around Baker's Hill at the southern end.",
