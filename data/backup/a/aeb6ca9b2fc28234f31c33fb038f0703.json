  "description": "This walk takes you along the now disused Border Union Railway line in the village of Newcastleton in the Scottish Borders. Newcastleton station closed along with the line in 1969 but the old track can now be used for a pleasant walk. You can pick up the trail just to the south of the village and follow it south to Kershopefoot. Along the way there's nice views of Liddel Water and the surrounding countryside and hills. You will also pass the remains of the old stations and the ruins of Mangerton Tower, a Scottish tower castle formerly belonging to the Armstrong family. See the video below for more details on this historic site. To continue your walking in the area head west to climb to the Langholm Monument for some fine views over the area.",
