  "description": "Shanklin is a popular tourist village located on the southern part of the island. With a sandy beach, charming old village, cliff tops trails and a wooded chine it's a popular place for starting or ending a walk. This walk takes you from Sandown to Shanklin using a section of the Isle of Wight Coast Path . The walk starts in Sandown next to the pier where you can pick up the waymarked footpath and follow it south along Sandown Bay to Welcome Beach, Little Stairs Point, Hope Beach and Shanklin. It's about 2 miles on a fairly flat path so should take about an hour. There are some climbs on the way with nice views from the cliff tops sections. The route finishes near Shanklin Chine where you can enjoy a stroll through a pleasant wooded area up to the old village. Here you'll find a number of attractive old thatched buildings and a decent tourist information centre. There's also a number of fine cafes and quaint gift shops to explore here.",
