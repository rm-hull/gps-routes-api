  "description": "This large reservoir near Sevenoaks includes a nature reserve with nice footpaths at its northern end. It's a nice place for an easy stroll with plenty of birds to look out for from the bird hides and viewpoints. Park at the visitor centre at Winkhurst Green to start your walk. Then pick up the footpaths heading south along the western side of the reservoir. There's pockets of woodland, fields and nice views across the water. The woodland areas are lovely in the spring when they are covered in bluebells. The area is a great place for wildlife watching so make sure you bring your binoculars. Look out for Mandarin Duck, Great Crested Grebe, Little Egret, Common Tern, Little Ringed Plover and Grey Heron on the water. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the visitor centre. You'll also find interesting displays and exhibitions here. Hever Castle is located just to the south. It's a nice place to continue your walking in the area with lakes and woodland surrounding the castle. Around here you can also pick up the Eden Valley Walk and follow it to the lovely Penshurst Place. Just to the north of the water you can visit Toys Hill and enjoy great views on the Greensand Ridge. Another great place for wildlife is the Sevenoaks Wildlife Reserve. The site covers 71 hectares (175 acres) and includes several lakes, ponds, reedbed and woodlands.",
