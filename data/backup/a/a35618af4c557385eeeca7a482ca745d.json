  "description": "This delightful Lake District village is located close to Wast Water Lake in the Wasdale Valley. There's a lovely village green, two fine old pubs and a 16th century church to see here. This circular walk from the village takes you down to Wast Water where there's some nice woodland trails along the lake. There's also fine views of the River Irt and the surrounding fells to enjoy on the way. Start the walk in the village centre and then pick up country lanes heading east towards Woodhow Tarn. Follow the paths south east from here and you'll soon come to a trail along the River Irt. Continue down to Low Wood where there's a pocket of woodland next to the southern tip of Wast Water. The route then heads along the lakeside path before turning around to pass High Birkhow and Wasdale Hall. Here you'll find a large Youth Hostel with well priced accommodation. It's set in an impressive half-timbered National Trust-owned house dating from 1829 and still retains many original features. The walk then passes along the Irt again before heading up towards Easthwaite and Kilnhow Crag. From here you head west to Cinderdale Bridge where you cross the river and return to Nether Wasdale.",
