  "description": "This walk takes you along a lovely section of the Glamorgan Heritage Coast in the beautiful Vale of Glamorgan it runs from Southerndown to Ogmore village on a fine cliff top path. Start the walk from the coastal public car park at Southerndown. This area overlooks the lovely Dunraven Bay and is also close to the 12th century Dunraven Castle. The existing manor house was rebuilt as a castellated hunting lodge in the early 19th century and was then remodelled later in the century. The surviving parts of the house and its lands are Grade II listed buildings. From the car park follow the coast path north west to Ogmore-by-Sea. It's a lovely area with views over the mouth of the Ogmore River to the Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes. The path then bends round to the east to follow the river into Ogmore village. Here you can pay a visit to the ruins of the 12th century Ogmore Castle. It's situated in a very picturesque location on the south bank of the River Ewenny and the east bank of the River Ogmore. To continue your walking from Southerdown try our Glamorgan Heritage Coast Walk which takes you in the other direction to the Grade II listed lighthouse at Nash Point. To extend this walk head over the river from Ogmore and visit the wonderful Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes. You could then continue on to visit the attractive coastal town of Porthcawl where there's the lovely Rest Bay beach and a pretty harbour.",
