The village is known for the Corris Railway, a narrow gauge heritage railway with steam trains taking you through the lovely Dulas Valley. This walk from the village takes you along the Afon Dulas to nearby Aberllefenni. It's about a 2.3 mile walk, skirting the edge of the expansive forest which lies just to the east of the setllement. You finish in Aberllefenni where you can visit the old quarry and the photogenic local waterfalls. You can extend the walk by continuing north east to visit the nearby Dyfi Forest. Here you will find miles of walking and cycling trails. The long distance Dyfi Valley Way can also be picked up in this area. If you head a few miles west there's some lovely waterside trails around the picturesque Tal-y-llyn Lake .",
