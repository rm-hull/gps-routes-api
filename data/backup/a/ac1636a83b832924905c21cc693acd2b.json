  "description": "These peaceful woods are located on the edge of Tunbridge Wells. There's a series of footpaths taking you around the site which includes a mixture of broadleaf and conifer woodland. The area is good for widlife spotting with lots of woodland birds and the possibility of spotting fallow or roe deer. Tunbridge Wells West train station is a short walk from the woods so you can easily come by public transport.",
