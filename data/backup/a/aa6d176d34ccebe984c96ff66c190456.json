  "description": "This Buckinghamshire based village has some nice trails through the Colne Valley and into the surrounding Chiltern Hills. The village is part of the 'Chalfonts' along with Chalfont St Giles and Little Chalfont. This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights to the east including the lakes and rivers of the Colne Valley and the Grand Union Canal. There's some attractive farmland and nice waterside sections to enjoy on the route. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the South Bucks Way. Follow the waymarked footpath east and then south and it will take you past Hogtrough Wood. The trail continues east along the Old Shire Lane Circular Walk before reaching the lakes of the Colne Valley at West Hyde House. The route then heads north to Pynesfield Lake where you can cross to join up with the Grand Union Canal and the Colne Valley Trail. The route then heads back to Chalfont St Peter on alternative footpaths and country lanes.",

      "content": "Just to the south is the neighbouring town of Gerrards Cross where there's some nice trails on the town's common and a notable 17th century commonside pub to visit afterwards. Near the village you will find a historic highlight of the area at the Chiltern Open Air Museum. The museum rescues and restores common English buildings from the Chilterns and relocates them to its 45-acre site, which includes woodland and parkland walking trails.  Just to the north west you'll find the sister village of Chalfont St Giles, part of the three Chalfonts. It's another attractive village notable as the former residence of John Milton, author of the epic poem 'Paradise Lost'. The cottage is now open as a museum and one of the literary highlights of the area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Chilterns Walks and the Buckinghamshire Walks pages."
