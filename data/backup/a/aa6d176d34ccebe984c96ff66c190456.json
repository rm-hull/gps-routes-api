  "description": "This Buckinghamshire based village has some nice trails through the Colne Valley and into the surrounding Chiltern Hills. The village is part of the 'Chalfonts' along with Chalfont St Giles and Little Chalfont . This circular walk from the village visits some of the highlights to the east including the lakes and rivers of the Colne Valley and the Grand Union Canal . There's some attractive farmland and nice waterside sections to enjoy on the route. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the South Bucks Way . Follow the waymarked footpath east and then south and it will take you past Hogtrough Wood. The trail continues east along the Old Shire Lane Circular Walk before reaching the lakes of the Colne Valley at West Hyde House. The route then heads north to Pynesfield Lake where you can cross to join up with the Grand Union Canal and the Colne Valley Trail. The route then heads back to Chalfont St Peter on alternative footpaths and country lanes.",
