  "description": "Follow a series of waymarked trails in this woodland area near Tidmarsh. There's lots of different trails to try with a mix of open countryside and woodland to enjoy. The site includes Broadleaved, mixed and yew woodland with lots of bluebells in the spring months. You can start your walk from Sulham village or from nearby Tidmarsh. There is a car park on Sulham Hill Road just to the east of the village. The Thames Path runs just to the north of Sulham. You can pick this up to extend your walking in the area. Just to the east you can pick up a waterside path running north along the River Pang to Pangbourne .",
