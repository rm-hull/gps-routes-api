  "description": "This cycling and walking trail in Derbyshire takes you on a tour of the countryside, villages and reservoirs near Burton-Upon-Trent and Swadlincote. It uses a mixture of quiet roads, bridleways and the woodland trails of the National Forest. There's some challenging climbs but with fabulous views over the surrounding South Derbyshire countryside. The route starts at the pretty Foremark Reservoir and heads to Repton Common and Milton before coming to the pretty village of Ticknall. Woodland sections through Stantons Wood and Robin Wood take you towards Ingleby and Seven Spouts before the final section takes you back to the reservoir via the Hangman's Stone. To extend your walking in the area you can visit the lovely Staunton Harold Reservoir or Calke Abbey. Here you will find woodland, ponds, meadows and a deer park.",
