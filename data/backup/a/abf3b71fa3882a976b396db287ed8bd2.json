The walk runs parallel to The Swale - the strip of sea separating North Kent from the Isle of Sheppey. It passes through the villages of Tonge and Oare and through the attractive market town of Faversham. Highlights include Little Murston Nature Reserve at the start of the route in Sittingbourne, the Oare Marshes Nature Reserve and the creeks at Conyer, Oare and Faversham. Look out for a huge variety of wading birds as you make your way along the route. There's also fine views over to the Isle of Sheppey to enjoy.",
