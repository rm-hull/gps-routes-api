On the way there are excellent views towards the nearby Forest of Bowland fells including Longridge Fell, Beacon Fell Country Park and Pendle Hill. On a clear day you can also see the Lake District mountains. In the village of St Michael's there's a wonderful old church and a nice loop walk along the river to enjoy.
