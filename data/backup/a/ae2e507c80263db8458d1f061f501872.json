  "description": "This walk starts from the Lancashire village of Great Eccleston and takes you along a pleasant section of the Wyre Way to St Michael's on Wyre. The village is located near a scenic bend in the river, allowing you to enjoy an easy walk through the local countryside. On the way there are excellent views towards the nearby Forest of Bowland fells including Longridge Fell , Beacon Fell Country Park and Pendle Hill . On a clear day you can also see the Lake District mountains. In the village of St Michael's there's a wonderful old church and a nice loop walk along the river to enjoy. You can catch the bus back or return the same way.",
