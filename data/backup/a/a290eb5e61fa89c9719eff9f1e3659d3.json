  "description": "Climb to this prominent Lakeland Fell on this popular circular route. The mountain stands at 892 metres (2,927 feet) making it the eighth highest in the Lake District. On the walk you'll enjoy splendid views of the valleys of Ennerdale and Wasdale. The fell is typically climbed from Wasdale Head where there is a popular car park. From here you head north to the rushing water of Ritson's Force Waterfalls. You continue to Gatherstone Head, crossing Gatherstone Beck on the way. The ascent continues along the Black Sail Pass before turning west to the Pillar summit via Looking Stead. The summit is wide and grassy with splendid views of most of the major Lakeland fells. You can also see Loweswater and Ennerdale Water. Nearby is Pillar Rock, considered one of the wonders of the Lake District. The striking rock is popular with rock climbers and located just to the north of the Pillar summit. After taking in the fine views you descend to Scoat Fell. From here the full horseshoe of the Western Fells can be seen. The descent continues to Red Pike fell, passing Scoat Tarn before coming to Dore Head. The final section takes you around Dorehead Screes and along Mosedale Beck before returning to the Wasdale Head car park. To continue your walking in the area you could climb to Scafell Pike. Scafell is the highest point in England and is often climbed from Wasdale Head. Just to the north of Pillar is Ennerdale Forest where there are footpaths leading to the lovely Ennerdale Water .",

      "content": "The circular walk around Wast Water also starts from Wasdale Head. It's a 7 mile trail around the park's deepest lake with fine views to the surrounding fells. On the eastern side of the water you can enjoy a climb to Whin Rigg and Illgill Head on a more challenging circular walk around Wast Water. There's some excellent views over the lake from these prominent peaks. The pretty Burnmoor Tarn can also be visited in this area. For more walking ideas in the National Park see the Lake District Walks page."
