  "description": "This rural Nottinghamshire village has some pleasant riverside and and countryside trails to try. It's a very appealing place with a waterfront home to several million-pound properties and a fine riverside pub for post walk refreshment. This circular walk from the village takes you along the River Trent to Hazelford before following country trails to the neighbouring villages of Bleasby and Morton. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Trent Valley Way and follow the waymarked footpath south to Hazelford Ferry where there's a pretty lock and weir. From here you can follow a pleasant country lane north west to visit Bleasby. The route then follows a mixture of country lanes and footpaths north east to Fiskerton Lodge and Grange before coming to Morton. From here it is a short stroll back into Fiskerton. You could extend the walk by continuing south west along the Trent towards Nottingham. The trail will take you past the settlements of Gunthorpe, Shelford and Radcliffe on Trent where you can try the popular cliff walk. For more information on the history and architecture of the village see the informative wikipedia page.",
