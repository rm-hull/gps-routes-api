This end of the beach (and the rest of Maenease Point) is in the care of the National Trust."

  "description": "This circular walk explores a wonderful headland on the Cornish coast. The area is located near the village of Gorran Haven and is the highest headland on the south coast of Cornwall. There's splendid coastal views, pretty beaches, lovely countryside and lots of wildlife to look out for. The walk starts from the Penare car park, about half a mile south of Dodman Point. From here you head west towards Hemmick Beach with wonderful views across Veryan Bay to the west. You then pick up the South West Coast Path to take you up to Dodman Point. Here you will find a large granite cross, placed here in 1896 as a navigational aid to seafarers. From the elevated headland there are fabulous views towards the Roseland Peninsula . Look out for wildlife including Dartmoor ponies, peregrine falcon, stonechat and gannet. The walk can also be started from the nearby village of Gorran Haven if you prefer. It's about a 2 mile walk from the village along the coast path to the point. It will take you past the lovely Vault Beach and the delightful Gorran Harbour.",
