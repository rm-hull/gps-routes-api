  "description": "This attractive market town is located in a fine location for walkers, sitting on the edge of the North York Moors National park and the Howardian Hills. It also includes a number of 18th century houses around the picturesque Georgian Market Place. The name 'Easingwold' is derived from an Anglian word meaning - people of Esa. This route from the town uses part of the Foss Walk to create a circular route through the area. On the way you'll visit the neighbouring village of Coxwold , Newburgh Priory, Oulston Reservoir and Crayke. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the long distance Foss Walk. Follow the waymarked trail north and it will take you through the countryside to Oulston and Newburgh Priory . The historic priory is one of the highlights of the area. It dates back to 1145 and includes grounds with a water garden, hand crafted topiary, a walled garden, woodland and a large lake.\u00a0Just beyond the priory you will find the worthy village of Coxwold. The little village includes a notable old pub and the interesting Shandy Hall. The hall is where author Laurence Sterne wrote the well known novel 'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy'. You can now explore the old hall and learn about Sterne in the associated museum. At Coxwold you also have the option of heading a short distance north east to visit Byland Abbey . It's another historic highlight of the area where you can explore the extensive ruins of the 12th century abbey buildings. This route heads south back to Oulston and turns east to visit the pretty Oulston Reservoir. There's views of the River Foss around this tranquil lake.  From here the Foss Walk heads south to visit Crayke which includes the noteworthy 15th century Crayke Castle. The last section then heads west along a country lane to return to Easingwold.",
