  "description": "This attractive market town is located in a fine location for walkers, sitting on the edge of the North York Moors National park and the Howardian Hills. It also includes a number of 18th century houses around the picturesque Georgian Market Place. The name 'Easingwold' is derived from an Anglian word meaning - people of Esa. This route from the town uses part of the Foss Walk to create a circular route through the area. On the way you'll visit the neighbouring village of Coxwold, Newburgh Priory, Oulston Reservoir and Crayke. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the long distance Foss Walk. Follow the waymarked trail north and it will take you through the countryside to Oulston and Newburgh Priory. The historic priory is one of the highlights of the area. It dates back to 1145 and includes grounds with a water garden, hand crafted topiary, a walled garden, woodland and a large lake. Just beyond the priory you will find the worthy village of Coxwold. The little village includes a notable old pub and the interesting Shandy Hall. The hall is where author Laurence Sterne wrote the well known novel 'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy'. You can now explore the old hall and learn about Sterne in the associated museum. At Coxwold you also have the option of heading a short distance north east to visit Byland Abbey. It's another historic highlight of the area where you can explore the extensive ruins of the 12th century abbey buildings. This route heads south back to Oulston and turns east to visit the pretty Oulston Reservoir. There's views of the River Foss around this tranquil lake. From here the Foss Walk heads south to visit Crayke which includes the noteworthy 15th century Crayke Castle. The last section then heads west along a country lane to return to Easingwold.",

The village has some interesting features including a village green, duck pond, pretty cottages, riverside trails and the impressive 17th century Nun Monkton Priory. The hall is located just a few miles south of the town near the city of York. Here you can pick up the York Millennium Way and York River Walk to explore the area. If you head north then you can visit another must see local attraction at Sutton Bank and the Kilburn White Horse. There's some stunning views and dramatic scenery to be found at this popular spot. The area also includes the pretty Gormire Lake which has a nice circular footpath around the perimeter. You can also explore the Hambleton Hills by picking up the trail from the Kilburn White Horse car park. To the south east is the worthy village of Sheriff Hutton. The historic settlement includes a photogenic ruined castle, a Grade I listed 12th century church and a fine country pub to relax in after your exercise. This area also includes Sutton on the Forest where you can visit the 18th-century Georgian English country house of Sutton Park which includes some beautiful landscaped gardens.
