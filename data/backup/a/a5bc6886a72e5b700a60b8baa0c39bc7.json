  "description": "This lovely nature reserve in Guildford has nice boardwalks and footpaths to follow through the site. The reserve is located next to the River Wey and has a man made lake, a woodland area and lots of wildlife to look out for. There's lots of interesting flora with wildflowers including ox-eye daisies, bluebells and the white flowered meadow sweet, yellow flag iris and bright rose-pink flowers of the willow herb. Water loving birds such as Great crested grebe, water-rails, herons and reed buntings can also be seen in the wetlands area. Keep and eye out for roe deer and rabbits in the woods. National Cycle Network route 223 runs through the reserve so you can bring your bike too. The route runs from Guildford town centre right to the reserve so it's easy to visit by bike. To extend your walk you can pick up the Wey South Path and continue along the river to Parsonage Water Meadows which is about a half a mile west of the reserve. Also nearby is Whitmoor Common where you will find extensive heathland, woodland, grassland and ponds crossed with miles of footpaths.",
