  "description": "Enjoy over 100 acres of coastal country park on this walking route in Holyhead, Anglesey. There are fabulous views of Holyhead Mountain, the Irish Sea and the Skerries - a group of offshore islands about 7 miles from the coast. The park includes a nature trail, various other footpaths, a visitor centre and good parking facilities. The Anglesey Coast Path runs through the park so there is scope for continuing your walk along the coast in either direction. Just along the coast you will come to the spectacular South Stack Lighthouse. Here you can descend the 400 steps to the island and enjoy fabulous views on the way. The area also includes the South Stack RSPB nature reserve where you can look out for puffins and porpoises. If you head in the other direction through Holyhead you will soon come to the lovely Penrhos Beach and Penrhos Coastal Park. The park has lovely coastal views and waymarked nature trails where you can look out for the resident red squirrels.",
