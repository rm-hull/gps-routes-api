  "description": "This walk climbs to Glaramara, a substantial fell in the Borrowdale area of the Lake District. Start the walk from the car park at Seatoller about 2.5 miles north of the fell. You then follow the Honister Pass east for a short distance before turning south along the path that will take you up to the fell. The path runs along Combe Gill to Thornthwaite Fell before passing Combe Head and arriving at the Glaramara summit. From here there are fantastic views of the Borrowdale Valley, Derwent Water and Skiddaw. To extend your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Seathwaite car park and enjoy a circular walk to Styhead Tarn and Sprinkling Tarn. This includes a visit to the lovely Taylor Gill Force Waterfall. The Allerdale Ramble also passes Seatoller You could pick up this long distance trail and explore the woodland and riverside paths along the River Derwent.",
