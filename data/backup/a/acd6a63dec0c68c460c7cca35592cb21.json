  "description": "This popular walk in Edzell takes you along a splendid river gorge on the North Esk river in Glen Esk. On the way there's lots of pretty waterfalls and interesting geological formations as you head through the area known as the Rocks of Solitude. The route starts in the village and heads north along the river to Gannochy Tower and Saw Mill Cottage. Here you cross the Gannochy Bridge where you'll find the blue door which leads to the grounds of 18th century Burn House. The route continues north passing the picturesque spot where the Burn of Kirkton flows into the North Esk. A little further on you'll come to the Loups Bridge where you can see the Salmon Leap and the remains of the suspension bridge. You continue north to the Rocks of Solitude and Doulie Cottage where you turn south to Woodburn and Brackens Lodge. The route then rejoins the river at Gannochy Bridge and heads back into Edzell.",
