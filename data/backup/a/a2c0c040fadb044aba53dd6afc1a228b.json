Together they change the water level of the navigation by 146ft 6in (44.6 metres). Despite their size they fill and empty quickly, being very well maintained. The low gearing of the paddles takes a lot of winding though! The house by the lock was (maybe is), presumably, the lock-keeper's house next to the top lock of the flight. It still appears to have no road access."

  "description": "This circular walk visits a flight of 21 locks located on the Grand Union Canal in Hatton, Warwickshire. The locks run for nearly 2 miles just to the west of the city of Warwick. The route takes you along the canal and then into the surrounding countryside and woodland. The walk starts from the parking area in Hatton and follows a footpath a short distance to the canal. You then head east along the towpath before turning south and heading into the countryside. Follow the footpaths and country lanes to Hampton on the Hill before turning west across Grove Park. The route skirts the edge of Whitehill Wood and then turns north past Hatton Country World. The attraction includes a number of retailers housed in old farm buildings and a family entertainment area with farm animals and an adventure playground. Shortly after you return to the canal and follow the locks back to the car park. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the canal-side cafe which has waterside outdoor seating. To extend your walking in the area you could follow the canal towpath west and visit Shrewley and Rowington, where you can pick up the Heart of England Way long distance trail. This can be followed to the nearby Baddesley Clinton where there's some nice footpaths to follow around the lakes, parkland and woodland on the estate. The bluebells in the adjacent Hay Wood are another attraction here. This walk start from Hatton but you could also start from Warwick and follow the canal west for a couple of miles to reach the locks.",
