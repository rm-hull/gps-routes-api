Little Stanney is a suburban village and civil parish in Cheshire, England located on the Wirral Peninsula and is located between Chester and Ellesmere Port. The village was originally part of the Stoak Parish in the Wirral Hundred. In 1894, Little Stanney became part of Chester Rural District. Part of the parish was transferred to the Municipal Borough of Ellesmere Port in 1967, the remainder becoming part of the City of Chester in 1974. The parish contains one building included in the National Heritage List for England and designated by English Heritage as a listed building. This is Rake Hall, which originated as a country house in the 17th century, and was later converted into a public house and restaurant."

View north along the Shropshire Union Canal (Ellesmere branch), seen from the disused Mickle Trafford railway bridge at Abbot's Meads, near Blacon. The rail track carries National Cycleway 5. At this bridge the Longster Trail extension (from Guilden Sutton to the east) leaves the cycleway to join the North Cheshire Way (Chester branch) on the towpath below; this runs north (as in the image) towards Stoak and south into Chester itself. The towpath also carries a branch of Cycleway 5 as the 'Canalside Trail'. The large Blacon housing estates lie out of sight to the left."

  "description": "This Cheshire based town sits in an interesting position on the Manchester Ship Canal, the Shropshire Union Canal and the River Mersey. It's home to a fine museum and also includes canalside walking trails and a number of local country parks. This walk explores the town's waterways museum before heading south along the Shropshire Union Canal to the neighbouring city of Chester. The walk starts from the excellent National Waterways Museum at Ellesmere Port docks. It's located at the northern end of the Shropshire Union Canal at the point where it meets the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey. The museum is concerned with the history of the UK's rivers and canals, with exhibits including canal boats, traditional clothing and steam engines. It's a nice place for a stroll with a number of surfaced footpaths to follow around the site. After exploring the museum you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it south through the Mersey Forest towards Croughton and Moston before coming into Chester. Here you can continue your walking by picking up the Chester Canal Walk or the Chester City Circular Walk. You can either return on the same paths to Ellesmere Port or you can catch a train back from Chester. It takes about 45 minutes and requires one change.",
