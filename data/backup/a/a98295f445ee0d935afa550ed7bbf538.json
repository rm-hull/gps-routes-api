  "description": "This walk takes you through the beautiful Silent Valley in the Mourne Mountains. There's lovely woodland trails to follow along the River Kilkeel to the Silent Valley Dam, with views across the water to the surrounding mountains. It's about a 2 mile stroll on fairly flat paths so suitable for most abilities. Start the walk from the car park to the south of the water. From here you can pick up the trails heading north past the ornamental lake to the dam wall. Here you'll find a visitor information centre and a cafe for refreshments. The walk then passes along the dam before turning south to follow nice woodland paths past another small lake and along the River Kilkeel. Near Cooligan Bridge you turn around to return to the car park. To continue your waterside walking in the area head to Spelga Dam . There's waterside trails along the lake shore at the southern end of the reservoir with a nice picnic area at the northern end. Similarly, Ben Crom Reservoir is just to the north and has nice trails to follow up to Blue Lough and Slieve Binnian . The Mourne Wall Challenge Walk passes along the dam wall. You can pick this up to further explore the area. For example you could follow the trail north east and enjoy a climb to Slieve Binnian for great views over the area.",
