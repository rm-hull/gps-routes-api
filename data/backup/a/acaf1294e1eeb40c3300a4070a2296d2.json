  "description": "This South West Norfolk based village is located near to the River Little Ouse and the RSPB's Lakenheath Fen. The village is known for the Elizabethan Manor House of Hockwold Hall. The Former Royal residence dates to the 15th century and is now used as a wedding venue. There are some nice waterside walks along the cut of channel and the drove tracks towards the nature reserve. There's good views of the surrounding Fenland countryside and the huge variety of wildlife in the Hockwold Washes to enjoy on the way. The Hereward Way long distance footpath can be picked up to the south of the settlement. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Hockwold Cum Wilton. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
