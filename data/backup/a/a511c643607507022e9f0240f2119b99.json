  "description": "This walk visits a pleasant green space in the Purley area of the London Borough of Croydon. The common covers 43 hectares and includes some good footpaths and the Riddlesdown Road bridleway which is suitable for cycling. There's also woodland areas, chalk downs, sheep/cattle grazing and a hill top with a fine view over the area. There's a car park towards the northern end of the site where you can start your walk. There's also Kenley train station on the western side of the site. The London Loop runs across the southern end of the common. You could extend your walk by following the waymarked trail east to visit Selsdon Wood. The nature reserve includes 200 acres of ponds, open meadows and ancient woodland including oak, beech, ash and sweet chestnut. If you were to head south west the London Loop would take you towards Coulsdon where you could enjoy a walk across Farthing Downs and the Happy Valley Park.",
