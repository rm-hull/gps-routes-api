  "description": "This pretty village in Wrexham County lies in a delightful spot on the River Dee. It's a pleasant place for a walk with fine scenery and two historic local pubs for some refreshment afterwards. This circular walk starts from the 17th century Boat Inn and takes you along the river before heading into the surrounding woodland and countryside. On the way you will also pass the weir at Erbistock Mill and the Grade II listed St Hilary's church. The area around the church is particularly lovely with peaceful riverside trails and evidence of the old ferry which once took passengers to the opposite side. The Maelor Way and the Wat's Dyke Way Heritage Trail run through the village. These long distance walking trails are a great way of further exploring the area.",
