  "description": "This Oxfordshire market town is famous as the location for the splendid Blenheim Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As well as the trails through the park there's also two fine long distance trails running past the town. This circular walk makes use of the Wychwood Way and Oxford Green Belt Way to take you through the countryside, parkland and woodland surrounding the town. The walk starts in the town centre and follows footpaths north east through the countryside to Sansoms Lane. Follow this north and it will take you onto the Oxford Green Belt Way at Sansoms Farm. Follow the trail west for about a mile and you will cross the River Glyme before picking up a footpath heading south into Blenheim Park. There's nice public footpaths here to follow through the woodland to a lakeside trail. This will lead you east, past the Queen Pool before returning to the town centre. To continue your walking around Woodstock, head east to pick up the towpath along the Oxford Canal. Around here there's also nice trails along the River Cherwell which you can explore on our Kidlington Circular Walk. To the south of the town there's nice waterside trails along the Thames Path to Farmoor Reservoir. Near here there's miles of woodland trails in Wytham Woods and the ancient market town of Eynsham to explore.",
