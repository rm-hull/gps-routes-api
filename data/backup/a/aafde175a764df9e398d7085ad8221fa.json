  "description": "Enjoy a large variety of flora and fauna in this delightful nature reserve in Somerset. The reserve has some nice footpaths with great views over the Mendip Hills and the Somerset Levels to enjoy. The expansive area of limestone downloand is great for wildlife spotting. Look out for chalkhill blue butterflies, brown hares and birds including skylark and meadow pipit. It's very beautiful in the summer months with wildflowers including bee orchids and horseshoe vetch to enjoy. You can start your walk from the village of Draycott just south of Cheddar. Follow the waymarked West Mendip way up into the reserve which reaches a height of 270 m (890 ft). From these high points there are wide ranging views over the surrounding countryside. The West Mendip Way crosses the reserve so you can pick this up to extend your walking in the area. The Rodney Stoke National Nature Reserve is just to the south while heading north will take you to the wonderful Cheddar Gorge. Also nearby is the lovely limestone nature reserve at Ebbor Gorge .",
