  "description": "This circular walk visits the atmospheric ruins of a Benedictine Abbey, near Fore village in County Westmeath. The abbey buildings date back to the 13th century though it was originally founded in the 7th century. It was a Benedictine priory and, at its height, might have had as many as 300 monks.\nThe monastery is classed as one of the \"Seven Wonders of Fore\" as the 'monastery built in a bog'. Also of interest is the remains of the ancient church which was built around AD 900. The circular walk is called St Feichin's Way and runs for about 2.6km around the site and the village. It is named after St Feichin who founded the Christian monastery in the seventh century AD.  You can start the walk from the on site car park.",
