This is a strange place, it looks like a village centre having shops and a large public house/hotel but it is in an isolated position separated from the body of Yelverton by the main road to Tavistock and facing the open heathland of Roborough Down (behind the photographer). History probably has a lot to do with it. Construction of the airfield for RAF Harrowbeer in WWII forced the main road to be moved away from this corner. Nowadays the area probably survives on the fact that it is easy to park a car here."
