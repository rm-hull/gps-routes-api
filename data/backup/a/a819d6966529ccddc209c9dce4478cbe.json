  "description": "Explore the woodland trails in Cottingley Woods on this walk in Bradford. The estate is located just to the west of the village and contains a number of footpaths taking you through the woods and then into the countryside. The area is well known for the Cottingley Fairies, which appeared in a series of photographs taken there during the early 20th century. The pictures came to the attention of author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who used them to illustrate an article for the 1920 Christmas edition of The Strand Magazine. Doyle, as a spiritualist, was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear evidence of psychic phenomena. In the early 1980s the young photgraphers admitted that the photographs were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's book of the time. This circular walk uses a section of the Bradford Millennium Way to take you through the north western section of the site and into the open countryside surrounding the woods. You can extend the walk by heading to the River Aire and enjoying the waterside trails. You can also pick up the Aire Valley Towpath and visit the nearby Bingley Locks.",

      "content": "Head into the nearby village of Harden and there's the noteworthy Malt pub for some post walk refreshments. The classic rural pub is situated on the eastern edge of Harden village and is a piece of architectural history. Once recognised as a Tetley Heritage Inn, it stands by a stream and is believed to have been constructed in 1550. Over the centuries, the building has served various purposes, evolving from a farmhouse to a coaching house, courtroom, and even a prison. Despite a refurbishment in July 2014, the pub retains many historical features. Notably, the \"cell\" room preserves elements such as a barred window and an inglenook fireplace dating back to the reign of William and Mary. The establishment comprises a main lounge, a cosy snug, and a rear dining area that has been expanded with the addition of an orangery. The pub boasts an extensive beer garden at the back, creating a pleasant outdoor space. This pub has a rich history and warmly welcomes walkers, cyclists, and horse-riders. It even provides facilities for those on horseback. Popular for its food offerings, the pub occasionally hosts food-themed events, making it a hub for both local residents and visitors alike.You can find them at Wilsden Road, Harden, BD16 1BG."
