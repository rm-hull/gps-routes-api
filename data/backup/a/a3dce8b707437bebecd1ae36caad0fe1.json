  "description": "This Somerset based village makes a fine start point for exploring the surrounding Quantocks Hills and Brendon Hills. This circular walk from the village uses part of the Macmillan Way and the Quantock Greenway to climb to some of the Quantock Hills located near to the settlement. On the way you'll climb to Black Hill, Thorncombe Hill and Bicknoller Hill while enjoying some wonderful views from the high points. The walk starts in the village where you can follow the Macmillan Way south east to Little Quantock Combe and Fire Beacon. The trail will take you north west along Crowcombe Park, climbing to Black Hill, Halsway Post, Lowsey Thorn, Black Ball Hill, Thorncombe Hill and Bicknoller Hill. On this section look out for lots of pretty heather in the summer months. There are also some splendid views from this ridge top part of the route. At Bicknoller village you turn south east, following the Quantock Greenway to Higher Halsway where you will pass the impressive 15th century Halsway Manor. You then continue pass Lower Halsway and Lawford before returning to the village. To continue your walking around Crowcombe head south to climb to the highest point in the Quantocks at Wills Neck .",
