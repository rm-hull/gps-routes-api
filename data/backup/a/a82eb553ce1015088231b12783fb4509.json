  "description": "The East Riding of Yorkshire town of Goole is located at the confluence of the rivers Don and Ouse and is the UK's furthest inland port, capable of handling nearly 2 million tonnes of cargo per annum. There's some nice trails to try along the rivers and two popular waymarked trails also pass through the area. This walk from the town of Goole follows a section of the Trans Pennine Trail to the nearby town of Brough. It's a riverside walk, first following the River Ouse before it joins with the River Humber near Brough. The route runs for about 20 miles along a flat path. At the end of the walk you can catch a train from Brough back to Goole. There's lots of wildlife to look out for on the way, particularly around the Humber Wild Fowl Refuge at Whitton Sands near Brough. The walk starts on Boothferry Bridge in Goole and follows the waymarked, riverside path east to Howdendyke, Kilpin Pyke, Skelton and Goole Bridge. The path continues to Saltmarshe Hall, Yokefleet, Blacktoft, Broomfleet and Ellerker Sands before coming into Brough.",

      "content": "To continue your walking in the area you can pick up the Howden 20 and follow it through the countryside to the north of the town. The Blacktoft Sands Nature Reserve can be found east of the town on the southern side of the river. It's an RSPB reserve with lots of birds to look out for. The Market Weighton Canal Walk and the Market Weighton Circular Walk can also be picked up near the town. If you follow the Aire and Calder Navigation canal west you could visit Southfield Reservoir. Here there's fishing, windsurfing and nice waterside footpaths to try. In the town centre there's the Oakhill Nature Reserve. The pretty reserve is something of a hidden gem with 150 acres of ponds, meadows, wetlands and woodlands. It's a lovely place for an easy stroll in the town. You can find them at 4A Lidice Road, Goole, DN14 6X."
