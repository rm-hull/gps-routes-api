  "description": "This walk visits RRH Brizlee Wood on the edge of Hulne Park near Alnwick. The walk starts in Alnwick and heads west along a public footpath to Brizlee Wood where there's peaceful woodland, rhododendrons\u00a0and Remote Radar Head Brizlee Wood\u00a0(or\u00a0RRH Brizlee Wood), an air defence radar station operated by the\u00a0Royal Air Force. The striking dome looks like a large golf ball and is positioned next to Cloudy Crags in a scenic, elevated location. You can extend the walk by exploring Hulne Park and visiting the nearby Brizlee Tower. The\u00a0Grade 1 listed\u00a0folly was erected in 1781 for\u00a0Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland. There's wonderful views over North Northumberland, the Borders and the coast from the top of the tower, though this is not normally open to the public.",
