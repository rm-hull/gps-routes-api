  "description": "This riverside village is located just north of Bristol and east of Yate in Gloucestershire. It's an interesting place for a stroll with a picturesque fishing pond, a noteworthy 12th century church, a 14th century Tithe Barn and Huckford Quarry, a public nature reserve popular with dog walkers. This walk from the village takes you south along a section of the Frome Valley Walkway to the historic Snuff Mills and Oldbury Court Estate. It's a very pleasant stretch of the river passing the interesting villages of Hambrook and Frenchay on the way. The route starts on the eastern side of the village where you can cross the river near the Viaduct on a footbridge. You can then follow the waymarked footpath south along the river passing Winterbourne Down, Damsons Bridge, Hambrook and Frenchay. Here you can explore the Woodland Trust's Frenchay Moor where there's some pleasant trails next to the historic village and Frenchay Common. From here it is a short walk to Snuff Mills where you will find a picturesque 19th century mill and some nice trails around the parkland on the Oldbury Court Estate.",
