  "description": "This Bedfordshire based town is close to several areas of woodland with miles of walking and cycling trails to try. To the east there are also some pleasant waterside paths along the River Ivel and the River Hiz. This walk from the town uses sections of the John Bunyan Trail and the Greensand Ridge Walk to visit Rowney Warren Wood, Maulden Woods, Chicksands Wood and the neighbouring village of Clophill. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the John Bunyan Trail and follow the waymarked footpath north west to Rowney Warren Wood. The woods include a network of walking paths and the Chicksands Bike Park where you can try some fine mountain bike trails. After leaving the woods you come to Appley Corner near Haynes where you can pick up the Greensand Ridge Walk. Follow the trail south west and it will take you into Chicksands Wood where there are lot of woodland birds and bluebells to see in the spring months. You continue west to the village of Clophill before entering Maulden Woods. These woods consist of semi-natural broadleaf woodland, acidic grassland and some conifer plantations. Look out for deer roaming around as you pass through this area. Near the woods you'll find the village of Maulden where you can enjoy some refreshments before the return leg.",
