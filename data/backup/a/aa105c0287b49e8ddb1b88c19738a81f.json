  "description": "This walk takes you to the wonderful limestone gorge of Troller's Gill in Wharfedale in the Yorkshire Dales. The walk starts in Burnsall and heads along the River Wharfe and the Dales Way to Haugh. Here you turn north and head to Skyreholme along the Fir Beck. Soon after you come to the splendid Parceval Hall Gardens. This Grade II listed manor house has 24 acres of formal and woodland gardens to explore and is an added bonus on the walk. From Parceval Hall you follow the Skyreholme Beck to Troller's Gill. It's a magnificent sight and well worth the climb! The route then descends through Appletreewick Pasture and Hartlington, returning to Burnsall. To continue your walking in the area you could visit the nearby Linton Falls or Grimwith Reservoir . The gorge is located near to the popular town of Grassington . You could reach it from the town by following the Dales Way along the River Wharfe to Burnsall and then continuing along the rest of this route. The village of Appletreewick is also very close by. You could also easily reach the site from there.",
