  "description": "This walk visits the village of Elterwater and its lake from Grasmere . It's a moderate 3 mile walk, climbing over the fells which separate the two villages. Starting in the village the route follows Red Bank Road around the western part of the lake. At the Wyke you pick up a footpath on your right to climb through a woodland section to Huntingstile Crag. There's lovely views here back down to Grasmere Lake and red squirrels to look out for in the woods. The walk then descends to the village of Elterwater where you could stop for refreshments at the large pub where there's outdoor seating with nice fell views. In the village you pick up a section of the Cumbria Way long distance footpath to take you east along the Great Langdale Beck. The waterside trail leads you through a pocket of woodland before coming out at Elterwater Lake where there's a nice seating area with views across the water. You can extend the walk by continuing along the River Brathay to Skelwith Bridge where you will pass the impressive Skelwith Force waterfall.",
