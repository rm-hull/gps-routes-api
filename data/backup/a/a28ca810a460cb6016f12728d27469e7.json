  "description": "This pleasant university town in Surrey is a nice place to explore on foot. The Thames River is nearby as is one of the most significant historic places in the country. This circular walk takes you from the town to one of the highlights of the area at Runnymede before heading to the  Thames for a waterside stroll. The walk starts from Egham train station and heads north through the town to Runnymede Park. Here you can learn about the history of the Magna Carte which was agreed by King John at Runnymede on the 15th June 1215. It promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown. You can then pick up a section of the Thames Path National Trail and visit the Runnymede riverside park near the town. There's a cafe, picnic area and bandstand in this area.",
