  "description": "This walk climbs to a series of wonderful viewpoints overlooking Dovestone Reservoir in the dark peak area of the Peak District. The challenging route runs for just over 6 miles, visiting the Ashway Stone, Dean Rocks, Great Dovestone Rocks and Chew Reservoir. Start the walk from the car park at the northern end of Dovestone Reservoir. From here you can pick up a path running east between the reservoir and the adjacent Yeoman Hey Reservoir. The path then climbs to the Ashway Stone before turning south to Dean Rocks and Great Dovestone Rocks. This section climbs to a height of over 1550ft with magnificent views over the surrounding reservoirs and peaks. There's also a series of striking rock formations so be sure to have a camera handy here. The route continues south past Bramley's Cot before descending to Chew Reservoir. There's nice views across the water as you skirt the western edge. The route then turns north west to climb toward Dish Stone Rock and the Chew Hills. Here you pick up the Oldham Way long distance trail to pass along the eastern edge of Dovestone Reservoir. This will lead you back to the northern end of the water and the car park. To extend your walk you can enjoy a full circuit of the reservoir. There is a well maintained footpath running around the water with splendid views of the surrounding moorland. There's also the Saddleworth Moor Walk which climbs across the moor, offering more wonderful views.",
