  "description": "The village of South Cave is located in the East Riding of Yorkshire and the Yorkshire Wolds. This circular walk from the village visits some of the lovely wolds and dales in the surrounding area. You'll visit Brantingham Wold, Welton Dale, Cave Wold and Great Wold with some lovely rolling countryside to enjoy on the way. The route runs for just over 12 miles using sections of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, the Beverley Twenty and other public footpaths. The walk starts on the eastern side of the village where you can pick up the Yorkshire Wolds Way. Follow the waymarked path south east to Woo Dale, Ellerker North Wood and Brantingham. You continue south east through Elloughton Wold to Welton. Here you turn north east to pass through the lovely Welton Dale. The path comes to Wauldby Dam and Turtle Hill where you turn west along the Beverley Twenty. Back at Ellerker Wood you follow a country lane north east to visit Riplingham before following a footpath west past Great Wold, Sweatty Hill and Cave Wold. Shortly after you return to South Cave where the route finishes. Just to the north there's the sister village of North Cave where you can enjoy an abundance of wildlife at the North Cave Wetlands Nature Reserve. The historic Hotham Hall Estate can also be explored in this area.",
