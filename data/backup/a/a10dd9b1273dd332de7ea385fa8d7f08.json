Today, the inside provides an open-plan layout with a bar, restaurant, shop, post office, games room, wood burning stoves & an open fire. The external provides a covered outdoor decking area at the rear and a seating area out the front for warm summer days. There's also a village shop within the pub with a deli counter which sells a variety of delicious, fresh products. You can find the pub in the village at postcode DT11 8TA for your sat navs. In Bere Regis, there's the Royal Oak to consider. The historic pub dates all the way back to the 16th century when it was originally a coaching inn. They serve good quality food and have a nice garden area for warmer weather too. You can find them on West Street with a postcode of BH20 7HQ for your sat navs."
