  "description": "Catbells is one of the most popular climbs in the Lake District. At 451 metres (1,480 ft) it is not particularly high so attracts lakeland walkers of all abilities. Alfred Wainwright said of Catbells: 'It is one of the great favourites, a family fell where grandmothers and infants can climb the heights together, a place beloved. Its popularity is well deserved, its shapely topknott attracts the eye offering a steep but obviously simple scramble.' The fell is located on the western side of Derwent Water near to the popular town of Keswick. This circular walk starts at the car park at Hawes End and climbs to Skelgil Bank and on to the summit on a good but steep path with minimal scrambling. From the summit there are fabulous views of Derwent Water, Bassenthwaite Lake, the Newlands Valley, Skiddaw and Keswick to the north, while the view south has a fine vista of Borrowdale.  You descend towards Manesty where you pick up the Allerdale Ramble waymarked walking trail which will take you back to the finish point at the car park. If you enjoy this climb you could try other popular nearby fells including Castle Crag and Latrigg. As stated the Allerdale Ramble walking trail runs past Catbells so this another option if you'd like to continue your walk. You could potentially follow it all the way to Keswick or head south into Borrowdale. Just to the north is the village of Braithwaite where you can climb to Grisedale Pike. It's a popular and challenging climb with wonderful views to the Cumbrian coast, the Vale of Keswick, the Pennines and the head of Derwentwater. On a very clear day you can even see the Belfast Hills and the Southern Uplands of Scotland. If you would like to climb the hill from Keswick then it's about a 3.5 mile hike to the summit. See the Catbells from Keswick Walk for full details. Just to the west of the fell top you can visit Little Town and explore the beautiful Newlands Valley on our circular walk.",
