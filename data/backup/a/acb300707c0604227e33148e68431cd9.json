Its excavated stone chambers at the eastern end usually get the most attention (see various other photographs). The long mound bears the scars of 5000 years of existence, which show up well in this low autumnal sunlight."

This well-worn path up the hillside is underlaid with a plastic matrix to try and reduce wear and tear from visitors' feet - it was laid in the summer of 2005 and the grass has now re-established."

  "description": "This walk visits a particularly impressive Neolithic chambered tomb in Wiltshire. The tomb has a fascinating history dating back over 5 thousand years to around the 37th century BC. The walk starts from the parking lay-by just to the north of the site. From here you can pick up a footpath heading south for about half a mile. It's a short climb with fine views over the area from the high points. Silbury Hill, the East Kennet Barrow, the Sanctuary and Windmill Hill are visible on a fine day. You can also explore inside the atmospheric ancient tomb and read about the history on the English Heritage supplied information boards.",
