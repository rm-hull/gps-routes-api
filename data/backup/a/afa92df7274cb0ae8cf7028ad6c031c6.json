  "description": "The industrial Lincolnshire town of Scunthorpe has some nice local parks and woodland to explore on foot. This walk visits Central Park and Brumby Woods in the town centre. The park is located close to the train station and has nice footpaths to try. There's also attractive gardens and an impressive fountain surrounded by flowers. The peaceful woods are located at the western end of the park and have a few nice trails to follow. It's also a designated nature reserve with bluebells, wild garlic and lots of woodland birds to look out for. Twigmoor Woods is located just to the south east of the town and a good place to continue your walking. Normanby Hall Country Park and Laughton Woods are also nearby and provide good walking opportunities in a scenic location.",
