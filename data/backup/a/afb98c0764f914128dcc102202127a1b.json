  "description": "A circular walk along the course of the old railway line in Tetbury. You can start the walk from the Station Yard car park in the town centre. Then follow a tree lined footpath heading north east along the line before returning along Herd Lane. At the north eastern end of the route you will come to Wor Well, the Source of the River Avon. It's an easy walk running for a distance of just under 2 miles. There's also a park surrounding the peaceful area. The single-track branch railway line connected Tetbury with the main line at Kemble on the line between Swindon and Gloucester. It was opened in 1889 and then closed in 1964.",
