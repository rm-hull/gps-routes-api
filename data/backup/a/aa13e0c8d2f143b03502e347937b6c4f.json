  "description": "This Northumberland village is located on the River Tweed next to the Scottish border. This walk from the village takes you along the river to the neighbouring village of Horncliffe, visiting the historic Norham Castle on the way. Starting in the village head north to meet up with the riverside path. Follow the trail east and you will soon come to the castle ruins which are run by English Heritage. It's a signficant site, dating back to the 12th century and designated as a Grade I listed building. It was regularly besieged by the Scots including Robert the Bruce during the 14th century. After exploring the castle you continue east past St Thomas' Island before coming to Horncliffe. The settlement is notable as the most northerly village in England. You can extend the walk by continuing east all the way to Berwick where you can pick up the Berwickshire Coastal Path. Head west to Coldstream and you could explore the lovely Hirsel Estate.
