At 475m above sea level, it provides great views across the Usk Valley towards the cone of the Sugarloaf Mountain on the other side. The pond was built around 1824 to provide water for the Garn Ddyrys Forge near Govilon in the valley below. It is probably known by this name as it was near the house of the Earl of Abergavenny's gamekeeper. Its Welsh name of Pen-ffordd-goch, translates as 'head of the red road', probably a reference to the red sandstone which was used in the construction of the mountain road to Govilon."

  "description": "This walk visits the delightful Keeper's Pond in Blaenavon. The pretty pond is located just to the north of the settlement, off the B4246. You can park at the car park on the southern side of the pond and then follow footpaths along the water. It's a beautiful spot with views over the water to the surrounding mountains of the Brecon Beacons. The lake is also a popular place for wild swimming and picnics. You can extend the walk by heading east to pick up Hill's Tramroad and then climbing to the Tumble. For a more challenging walk head up to the summit of Blorenge to the north east.",
