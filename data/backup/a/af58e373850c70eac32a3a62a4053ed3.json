  "description": "This walk takes you to the beautiful Hardraw Force waterfall in the Yorkshire Dales. Access to the waterfall is through the 13th century Green Dragon Inn for a small fee. It's worth the fee as the waterfall is England's highest single drop waterfall, falling some 100ft. A footpath takes you through ancient woodland and along the Hardraw Beck to the falls. The falls are in a lovely spot set in the spectacular narrow gorge of Hardraw Scaur.  The area includes a new Heritage Centre with information about the falls and facilities such as toilets, showers and a cafe. There's plenty of good options for continuing your walking in the area. You could head to the nearby Cotter Force waterfall where you'll find another good footpath leading to these pretty falls. The Pennine Way also runs past Hardraw so you could pick this up too. The 10 mile Hawes Circular Walk takes you on a tour of the rivers, becks, waterfalls and hills surrounding the town. It visits Hadraw Force so you could pick up the trail to continue your walk.",
