  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful woodland walk through Oakley Wood, near Leamington Spa. The wood covers 47 hectares (116 acres) and consists of ancient woodland with lots of bluebells and wildflowers in the spring and summer months. It's also a significant butterfly site containing 70% of Warwickshire's butterfly species including Clouded Yellow, Large White, Small White and Small Tortoiseshell. You can also look out for deer and a variety of woodland birds including spotted woodpecker and blackcap. There are two waymarked walking routes to follow in the woods, a blue trail with 8 trail marker posts and a red one with 12 posts. To extend your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Charlecote Park. Here you can enjoy a walk along the River Avon and visit the lovely waterfall and the large lake. You can reach the park from the nearby village of Wellesbourne on the Wellesbourne Walk. It's about a 2 mile walk from the village, running along the River Dene. You can also visit the village's historic watermill beforehand. Also nearby is Burton Dassett Hills Country Park. The elevated park is located near the pretty little village of Avon Dassett and commands some wonderful views from the high points. From the village the National Trust's splendid Farnborough Hall can also easily be accessed.",

The fine Georgian Mansion is surrounded by Capability Brown landscaped grounds with woodland, lakes, sculptures and some particularly impressive redwoods. The site also includes an award winning art gallery which is well worth a visit. Near here there's also Ettington Park to explore.
