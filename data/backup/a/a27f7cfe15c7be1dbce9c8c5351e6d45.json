  "description": "This circular cycling trail runs through the Cambridgeshire Lodes on National Cycle Route 11 from the Wicken Fen Nature Reserve to Bottisham. The Lodes are ancient man made waterways created to link a series of Fenland villages to the River Cam. It's a pleasant area for a cycle or walk with flat, quiet paths to follow. The route starts off at Wicken Fen where car parking is available. From here you head south along Drove Tracks to White Fen and the village of Lode where you will pass the historic Anglesey Abbey. You could stop off to enjoy a stroll around the beautiful gardens of this photogenic Jacobean mansion. From Lode you continue south to the village of Bottisham where you turn north to pass Bottisham Park. The route continues through Swaffham Bulbeck, Swaffham Prior and Reach before coming to Burwell. Here you turn west through Burwell Lode to return to Wickham Fen. Much of the route takes place on off road tracks or quiet country lanes so is also suitable for walkers.",
