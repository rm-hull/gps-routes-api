  "description": "This circular walk around the Oxfordshire town of Faringdon, visits Faringdon Folly and the village of Littlelworth. The route uses public footpaths to take you through the countryside surrounding the town before climbing Folly Hill where there are lovely views over the surrounding area. The Folly is surrounded by 4 acres of attractive woodland with a delightful sculpture trail which is great for children. On certain days you can climb the tower for far reaching views over the Oxfordshire countryside. Look out for wildlife including Red Kites, Buzzards and various woodland birds as you make your way around the site. If you would like a shorter walk just use the last section of this route to climb to the folly from the town. To extend your walking in the Faringdon area you could head to the nearby Badbury Clump. Here you will find a hill top Iron Age Hillfort, bluebell woods and nice views over the Vale of White Horse. Badbury Hill and Badbury Forest are located just to the west of the town. Just to the north of Badbury Hill you will also find the lovely Buscot Park where there's 100 acres of woodland, lakes and formal gardens to explore. To the north of the town you can pick up the Thames Path and enjoy a riverside walk to Lechlade .",

      "content": "Just to the west you could pick up the Highworth Walk where you can visit the 17th century Hannington Hall and enjoy the Georgian architecture in the pleasant market town of Highworth. To the south there's trails along the old Wilts and Berks Canal in Shrivenham. The D'arcy Dalton Way passes just to the west of the town. This waymarked long distance trail starts off to the north at Wormleighton Reservoir and heads south through the Cotswolds towards Ashbury. It's a good way of further stretching your legs if you have time. For more walking ideas in the area see the Oxfordshire Walks page."
