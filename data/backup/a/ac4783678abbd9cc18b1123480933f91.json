  "description": "The village of Coleford is in an ideal place for exploring the wonderful Forest of Dean. This circular walk uses part of the Gloucestershire Way to visit Cannop Ponds, located just to the east of the village. The walk starts from the car park at Milkwall, just to the south of Coleford. From here you can pick up the Coleford Milkwall and Parkend railway path and follow it east to Bostonbury Hill. Near here you pock up the waymarked Gloucestershire Way which you can follow north to the ponds. There's a nice trail heading around the ponds where you can look out for lots of wildlife on the water. After rounding the ponds you can follow woodland trails through the RSPB's wildlife rich Nagshead Nature Reserve back to the car park. Just to the south of the village you will find the delightful Puzzlewood. It's an unusual place with ancient trees, rope bridges, interesting rock formations, secret caves and overhanging boulders. Other worthy nearby options include the Forest of Dean Family Route, the delightful Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail, the Speech House Walk and Mallards Pike Lake. A little further afield, but still well worth a visit, is Symonds Yat Rock. It's located a few miles to the north east and includes a climb to a wonderful view point overlooking the Wye Valley .",
