  "description": "This walk takes you to the amazing 449-foot sea stack on the island of Hoy in the Orkney Islands. The walk begins from the Rackwick car park and follows a popular signposted footpath to the Old Man of Hoy. There are splendid views of the beautiful Rackwick Bay and of the surrounding countryside and hills on this varied walk.  Look out for peregrine falcons near the spectacular sea cliffs.",
