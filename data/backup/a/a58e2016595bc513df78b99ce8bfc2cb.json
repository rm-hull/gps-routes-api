The reservoir was one of the compensation reservoirs built for the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in the late 19th Century to cope with increased traffic, because the more times a lock is used, the more water is lost from the upper levels. Seen from Moor Lane. Pendle is just visible on the left-hand horizon through the haze."

  "description": "This walk visits the Winterburn Reservoir in the Yorkshire Dales near the settlements of Winterburn and Hetton. The reservoir is a little of the beaten track so a nice place for a peaceful walk in the Dales. On the western side of the water there's some nice waterside paths while on the eastern side you can climb to a fine viewpoint on a bridle track. There's lovely views across the water to the surrounding Dales countryside and hills.",

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "Just to the north west you can explore the popular Malham Tarn Estate and enjoy more waterside walking. The Dales High Way passes the lake and could be followed to the estate as an extension to your outing. The long distance waymarked trail explores many of the highlights of the Dales, running from Saltaire to Appleby-in-Westmorland for a distance of approximately 90 miles. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks page."
