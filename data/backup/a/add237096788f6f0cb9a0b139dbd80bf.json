  "description": "This walk visits the splendid Harrow Viewpoint in North London. From here you can pick up the London Loop and visit the adjacent Harrow Weald Common and the nearby Bentley Priory. Start the walk from Harrow Viewpoint car park on Old Redding Road. There's ample parking with fine views over North London to enjoy. From here you can pick up the London Loop footpath and follow it north to the common. Here you'll find woodland, heath and pasture with redwoods, rhododendrons and marsh plants like yellow iris and willow scrub. The path continues to Bentley Priory Nature Reserve where you'll find ancient woodland, grassland, scrub, wetland, streams and a lake. The grounds surround Bentley Priory, an eighteenth to nineteenth century stately home and deer park. To extend the walk you can continue along the London Loop to Aldenham Country Park where there's a nice path along the lake.",

It's a lovely spot with the bar overlooking the hotel's gardens, terrace and croquet lawn. The 19th-century Tudor-style country house is located in the former home of Sir William Gilbert. Gilbert was an English dramatist, librettist, poet and illustrator best known for his collaboration with composer Arthur Sullivan, which produced fourteen comic operas including The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado."
