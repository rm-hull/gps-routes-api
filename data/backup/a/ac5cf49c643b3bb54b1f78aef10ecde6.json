  "description": "This lovely nature reserve near Coventry has some nice footpaths taking you around a series of lakes and lagoons. There's 220 acres of reedbeds, willow carr, grassland and woodland to explore. There's also views of the River Avon, a nature trail and a brass rubbing trail. Look out for wildlife including Otter, Bittern, Badger, Great Crested Newt, Long-eared Owl. The nature centre is the headquarters of the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust and includes a visitor centre with educational exhibits. There's also a nice team room where you can enjoy refreshments after your walk. The site is located just to the south east of Coventry. You can park at the good sized car park off Brandon Lane to start your walk. The reserve is located only a short distance north of the village of Ryton-on-Dunsmore. You could start the walk from here if you prefer. To extend your walking in the area you could head north towards Binley Woods and explore Brandon Woods where there's some peaceful woodland trails to try. Three long distance trails also pass just to the south of the site. You could pick up the Coventry Way, Shakespeare's Avon Way and the Warwickshire Centenary Way to further explore the countryside around the reserve. Just to the north you will find Coombe Country Park. Here you will find 500 acres of beautiful gardens, woodland and lakes, with splendid views of Coombe Abbey. Ryton Pools Country Park is located just to the south of Ryton-on-Dunsmore. There's a number of small lakes and woodland trails through Ryton Woods.",
