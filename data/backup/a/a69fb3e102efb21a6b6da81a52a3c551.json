  "description": "Explore the huge estate surrounding the ruins of this 12th-century Augustinian monastery. There are miles of riverside walking trails to follow with the River Wharfe running through the estate. The paths take you to the Strid - here the River Wharfe becomes very narrow causing the water to rush with great force at this point. There are also colour coded nature trails taking you through ancient woodland and bluebells in spring. The fascinating ruins of the 12th century priory are also worth exploring. Nearby are stepping stones across the river which are always popular. If you are interested in a more challenging walk then you could try the hike to Simon's Seat which starts from the abbey car park. It's a splendid walk taking you across the woodland and heathland of the Valley of Desolation with rushing becks and pretty waterfalls to enjoy on the way. From the peak of the hill there are wonderful views across the Yorkshire Dales to enjoy. The Dales Way also runs through Bolton Abbey so you could continue along this path. Heading north will take you along the river to the popular village of Burnsall. Follow it south and you will soon come to Addingham and Ilkley. You can reach the abbey from the town on our Ilkley Riverside Walk which is about a 6 mile hike along the Wharfe. The climb to Beamsley Beacon starts from the nearby village of Beamsley. It's a good climb giving splendid views of the area. You could also head to the south west and visit Chelker Reservoir.",
