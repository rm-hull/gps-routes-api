  "description": "This area in the West Pennine Moors is a popular place for walkers with woodland trails, reservoirs and a fantastic hill climbs to try. This circular route visits some of the highlights of the area including the Tockholes Woodland Plantation, Roddlesworth Reservoir, the Darwen Tower and Bold Venture Park. The walk starts from the Roddlesworth Information Centre on Tockholes Road where there is a good sized car park. From here you can pick up a nature trail heading north west through the Tockholes Number 2 Plantation to Roddlesworth Reservoir. The route then picks up the Witton Weavers Way and follows the waymarked trail along the reservoir before turning north to visit Tockholes village. You then head south east to pass Earnsdale Reservoir and Sunnyhurst Reservoir. Here you turn south to enjoy a climb to iconic Darwen Tower.  The tower was built in the late 19th century to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. There's excellent views over the surrounding moors from this elevated spot. The route then descends to the east to pay a visit to Bold Venture Park. This pretty park on the outskirts of Darwen includes peaceful woodland trails and ponds. After exploring the park the route then heads west across Darwen Moor to return to the visitor centre and the car park.",
