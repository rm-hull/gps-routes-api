  "description": "Explore the Jurassic Coast on this coastal walk between Weymouth and Swanage. The route runs for just over 30 miles, passing a series of beautiful bays and sites of geological interest. Starting on the front in Weymouth you head north east along the South West Coast Path , passing Lodmoor Country Park near Preston. The route continues east past the Osmington White Horse to the lovely Ringstead Bay. The next stage takes you to Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door , two of the most picturesque highlights of this section of coast. The route then heads to the noteworthy Kimmeridge Bay and Chapmans Pool . The former is a marine wildlife reserve with lots of little rock pools to observe. The final stage takes you past the ancient St Aldhelm's Chapel and Durlston Country Park before coming into the popular seaside resort of Swanage. There's a nice beach with lots of good cafes and pubs for refreshments after your exercise.",
