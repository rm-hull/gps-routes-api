  "description": "Explore the Jurassic Coast on this coastal walk between Weymouth and Swanage. The route runs for just over 30 miles, passing a series of beautiful bays and sites of geological interest. Starting on the front in Weymouth you head north east along the South West Coast Path, passing Lodmoor Country Park near Preston. The route continues east past the Osmington White Horse to the lovely Ringstead Bay. The next stage takes you to Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door, two of the most picturesque highlights of this section of coast. The route then heads to the noteworthy Kimmeridge Bay and Chapmans Pool. The former is a marine wildlife reserve with lots of little rock pools to observe. The final stage takes you past the ancient St Aldhelm's Chapel and Durlston Country Park before coming into the popular seaside resort of Swanage. There's a nice beach with lots of good cafes and pubs for refreshments after your exercise.",

Situated on the cliff tops of the South West Coast Path, just outside the village of Osmington, the Smugglers Inn is a traditional English pub with stunning views overlooking the Isle of Portland. The pub also has an interesting history having been the headquarters of the French smuggler Pierre Latour and one of the main landing places for smuggled goods in the 17th century. Notably the Inn was originally built in the 13th century, with its own brewery at the rear. There's a lovely large garden area which is perfect for relaxing in when the weather is fine. You can fine the pub right on the coast at a postcode of DT3 6HF for your sat navs."
