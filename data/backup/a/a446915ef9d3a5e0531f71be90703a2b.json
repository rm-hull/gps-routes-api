  "description": "This park in central London is one of the finest and most popular parks in the capital. There are nice surfaced footpaths to follow around the large lake and through the park's attractive woodland. Look out for wildfowl on Duck Island and the resident St James's Park Pelicans. Other highlights include the splendid 20ft high Tiffany Fountain with Buckingham Palace behind it. You can also cross the Blue Bridge over the lake and enjoy fine views of Horse Guards Parade, Big Ben and the London Eye. The Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk, the Jubilee Greenway and the Jubilee Walkway pass through the park so these are good options if you would like to extend your walking in the area. You can follow these long distance trails to the nearby Green Park, Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. The park is also just a 5 minute walk from the River Thames where you can pick up the Thames Path. ycling is not permitted but there are bike parks at the eastern end of the park and several cycle routes pass the park. London Cycle Network Route 50 runs to the Mall along the northern side of the park. You can follow it to the park from Oxford Street and Mayfair. The Station's circular ride runs along Birdcage walk on the southern side of the park. This gives lovely views across the park from your bike. Cycle Superhighway 3 also skirts the southern edge of the park. The popular trail runs from Lancaster Gate to Greatfields Park in Barking, passing several of the city's highlights on the way. You could follow it to nearby Hyde Park where there are some lovely traffic free paths to follow. You can virtually explore the park using the google street view link below!",

It's well worth a visit with beautiful gardens, wildlife rich woodland, a stunning Japanese garden with waterfalls and a nice cafe for refreshments."
