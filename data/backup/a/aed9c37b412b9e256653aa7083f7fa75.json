The undergrowth smells damp and earthy, with fox scent here and there. The bracken is tall, the foxgloves are making a last brave show against a backdrop of ragwort and thistles."

  "description": "Enjoy several waymarked cycling and walking trails in this large woodland area in Mansfield. The cycle trails include a 3 mile, green graded ride which is great for families. The Adventure Cycle Trail is blue graded and runs for 6 miles - it's also a nice flat ride which is suitable for all abilities. It takes place on a super all weather limestone surface so you can try it at any time of year. For enthusiasts there is the red graded Kitchener Trail which is a much faster and more challenging ride. Walkers can enjoy two waymarked walking trails through mature pine woodland and lowland heathland. The Dragonfly Trail runs for 1 mile and takes place on a well surfaced path. The Nightjar Trail is unsurfaced and runs for about 2 miles. If you'd like to continue your exercise you could visit the nearby Vicar Water Country Park for more walking and cycling trails. The Robin Hood Way runs just past the eastern side of the park. You could pick up the long distance trail and visit Rufford Country Park where there's 150 acres of historic parkland.",
