  "description": "Enjoy a stroll along the River Dee to these lovely falls on this short walk in Denbighshire. It's a really beautiful spot with a 460 feet (140 m) long distinctively shaped weir surrounded by attractive woodland. You can park at the car park by the river and then follow a nice surfaced footpath to the falls. It's a short waterside walk along the river and canal, running for about half a mile. There's also the option of following the canal and riverside path from Llangollen to Horseshoe Falls. It's about a 2 mile walk from the town centre or train station. You can virtually explore the footpath leading from the car park to the falls using the google street view link below! To extend your walking in the area you could enjoy a waterside walk along the Llangollen Canal or explore the countryside around the town on the Llangollen Round .",
