  "description": "This three mile circular walk explores the countryside around the Oxfordshire villages of Adderbury and Bodicote. The walk makes use of various public footpaths surrounding the village with nice views of the Sor Brook and the surrounding countryside. The large village has two village greens, pretty cottages and\u00a0St. Mary's Church which dates from the 13th century. The walk starts in East Adderbury, heading north past Twyford to the Sor Brook. You return through the countryside via Bloxham Grove and West Adderbury. There's lots of good options for continuing your walk. You could head a short distance east of the village centre and visit the Adderbury Lakes Nature Reserve. There's plenty of interesting flora and fauna to look out for here. The village is located just south of Banbury where there's several good walking options. You can also head east and pick up the Oxford Canal Walk and enjoy an easy walk along the towpath. Just to the south is the village of Deddington where you can enjoy another circular walk to Clifton.",
