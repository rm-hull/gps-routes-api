  "description": "This three mile circular walk explores the countryside around the Oxfordshire villages of Adderbury and Bodicote. The walk makes use of various public footpaths surrounding the village with nice views of the Sor Brook and the surrounding countryside. The large village has two village greens, pretty cottages and St. Mary's Church which dates from the 13th century. The walk starts in East Adderbury, heading north past Twyford to the Sor Brook. You return through the countryside via Bloxham Grove and West Adderbury. There's lots of good options for continuing your walk. You could head a short distance east of the village centre and visit the Adderbury Lakes Nature Reserve. There's plenty of interesting flora and fauna to look out for here. The village is located just south of Banbury where there's several good walking options. You can also head east and pick up the Oxford Canal Walk and enjoy an easy walk along the towpath. Just to the south is the village of Deddington where you can enjoy another circular walk to Clifton.",

      "content": "The neighbouring village of Bloxham is located just to the west of Adderbury. Here you can pick up the Bloxham Circular Walk to further explore the countryside. Just to the north you can pick up the Bodicote Circular Walk. This visits some of the local highlights including Bodicote Lake, the restored 19th century windmill, the 13th century church and the Georgian Bodicote House. There's also an 18th century pub to visit in the pretty village afterwards. Just to the east is the neighbouring village of Kings Sutton. The Kings Sutton Walk visits the village, the lakes and the canal. There's more pleasant local trails around the ancient Tusmore Park Estate. The estate dates back to the 14th century and includes woodland, streams, ponds and pleasant tree lined avenues. It can be found just to the north of the peaceful woodland trails in Stoke Wood. Just to the south east there's neighbouring Aynho where you can explore the 17th century Aynho Park Estate. There's also a fine canalside pub to visit in this area.
