If you follow it south it will take you towards the Darnaway Forest and the Logie Steading Findhorn River Walk. The estate includes some fine riverside walks, a garden centre, a cafe and some splendid waterfalls at the photogenic Randolph's Leap. Just to the west there's also the historic Brodie Castle. The 16th century castle is run by the National Trust for Scotland and includes some lovely grounds with 400 varieties of daffodil, sculptures, gardens and a wildlife rich lake."
