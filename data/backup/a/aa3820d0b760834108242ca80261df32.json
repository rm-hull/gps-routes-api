  "description": "This circular walk around the market town of Amersham visits the nearby village of Chalfont St Giles while exploring the attractive countryside of the Misbourne valley. There's riverside paths, woodland trails and a series of moderate hill climbs with splendid views of the Chilterns countryside. The walk starts near the train station and passes through Parsonage Wood before heading east towards Little Chalfont. You then skirt the edge of Pollards Wood and continue into Chalfont St Giles. It's a pretty village with a duck pond fed by the River Misbourne. Other highlights include the church of Saint Giles which is of Norman architecture and dates from the 12th century. You can also visit the former home of John Milton, author of the epic poem 'Paradise Lost'. The house is now a open to the public as a museum and includes an extensive collection of 17th-century first editions of John Milton's works, both poetry and prose. The village is roughly the half way point on the walk so a great place to stop for refreshments on one of the nice pubs or cafes. After exploring the village the route then follows footpaths through the attractive farmland to the south of the river. You'll pass close to the pretty Hodgemoor Woods which is worth a short detour if you have time. The 250 acre bluebell wood has miles of good footpaths and mountain bike trails. The woods also have a healthy population of muntjac deer to look out for. The South Bucks Way long distance trail runs through the area. You can use the waymarked path to go directly to Chalfont St Giles if you prefer a shorter walk. The path continues south through Chalfont St Peter before coming to the splendid Colne Valley. Just to the north of the town you can pick up the Chess Valley Walk and enjoy a riverside stroll along the River Chess.",
