The right hand building contains the winding engine and the left hand one is where the Fluorspar was tipped out of the tubs. The entrance to the inclined drift can be seen on the left. This mine was formerly owned by British Steel as a source of Fluorspar - used as a flux in steelmaking."

  "description": "This historic former mining village is located in the Pennines in the county of Northumberland. The village includes a heritage centre where you can learn all about the industrial history of the area. There's also a nature walk and a water-powered Armstrong engine which operated the machinery in the mineyard in the 19th century. This circular walk starts from the heritage centre and follows public footpaths around the old mine buildings. You can then enjoy riverside footpaths along the River East Allen. There's some splendid views of the surrounding North Pennines hills and forestry to enjoy on the way. You'll also pass the pretty Springhouse Reservoir, a small lake lying to the south west of the settlement. You can extend the walk by heading a short distance east to visit the picturesque Eastend Reservoir.",
