  "description": "Explore the gardens and woodland walk of this delightful estate on this short route in Handcross, near Haywards Heath. You'll pass through meadows filled with wild flowers and the rock garden planted with alpines. There are also peaceful woodland walks with pools, streams and a Arboretum to enjoy. Access to the woodland walks is free and located behind the car park. The house is also fascinating - it was partially destroyed by fire in 1947, but the ruins of the gothic mansion remain. The Handcross Walk starts from the village and takes you to the nearby Hyde Estate.",
