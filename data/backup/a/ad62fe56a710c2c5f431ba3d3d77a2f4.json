  "description": "Explore the gardens and woodland walk of this delightful estate on this short route in Handcross, near Haywards Heath. You'll pass through meadows filled with wild flowers and the rock garden planted with alpines. There are also peaceful woodland walks with pools, streams and a Arboretum to enjoy. Access to the woodland walks is free and located behind the car park. The house is also fascinating - it was partially destroyed by fire in 1947, but the ruins of the gothic mansion remain. The Handcross Walk starts from the village and takes you to the nearby Hyde Estate.",

      "content": "Just to the north east there's more beautiful gardens at High Beeches Gardens. In the park you will find woodland trails, ponds, azaleas, rhododendrons, a lovely wildflower meadow and a collection of rare and exotic flowers and plants. The gardens are set on a hillside so there are marvellous views in all directions. The circular Cuckfield Walk visits the gardens from the nearby village. Just to the south there's Bolney where you could pay a visit to the impressive Bolney Wine Estate. Here you can enjoy guided tours of the vineyard and learn all about the history of the wine making process. The pretty village also includes a noteworthy 12th century church, several listed buildings and the well known Bolney Stage pub which is hundreds of years old. For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks and High Weald Walks pages."
