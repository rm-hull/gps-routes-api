  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along this pretty reservoir in the Charnwood Forest area of Leicestershire. It's about a 3.5 mile walk around the water with nice views of the surrounding countryside and woodland. You can also look out for a variety of water loving wildlife on the lake. Keep your eyes peeled for tufted duck, cormorant, great crested grebe and canada goose. There's a car park at the north western end of the water on Roecliffe Road. From here you can pick up the nice surfaced footpath which will take you along the western side of the reservoir to the boat house. You can follow footpaths all the way around the reservoir with a visit to the little village of Cropston on the eastern side. The last half mile from Cropston back to the car park follows pavements along Reservoir Road and Roecliffe Road. The route includes a section through the adjacent Bradgate Country Park where you can look out for the resident deer. There's lots of good options if you would like to extend your walk. You could further explore the parkland and woodland of the 830 acre Bradgate Park or head north and visit Swithland Woods and Swithland Reservoir . The Charnwood Forest circular walk also passes the reservoir so you could pick this up and head to the second highest point in the county at Beacon Hill.",
