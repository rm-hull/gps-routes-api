  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along this pretty reservoir in the Charnwood Forest area of Leicestershire. It's about a 3.5 mile walk around the water with nice views of the surrounding countryside and woodland. You can also look out for a variety of water loving wildlife on the lake. Keep your eyes peeled for tufted duck, cormorant, great crested grebe and canada goose. There's a car park at the north western end of the water on Roecliffe Road. From here you can pick up the nice surfaced footpath which will take you along the western side of the reservoir to the boat house. You can follow footpaths all the way around the reservoir with a visit to the little village of Cropston on the eastern side. The last half mile from Cropston back to the car park follows pavements along Reservoir Road and Roecliffe Road. The route includes a section through the adjacent Bradgate Country Park where you can look out for the resident deer. There's lots of good options if you would like to extend your walk. You could further explore the parkland and woodland of the 830 acre Bradgate Park or head north and visit Swithland Woods and Swithland Reservoir. The Charnwood Forest circular walk also passes the reservoir so you could pick this up and head to the second highest point in the county at Beacon Hill.",

There is indoor and outdoor seating. About a mile north of the reservoir you'll find the pretty village of Swithland and the Griffin Inn. They do good food and have a covered outdoor area which can be used rain or shine. There's a stylish interior too with with exposed beams and stone walls. In 2019 they were voted pub of the year in the Leicestershire Tourism and Hospitality Awards. You can find the pub at postcode LE12 8TJ."

      "content": "The circular Woodhouse Eaves Walk starts from the nearby pretty village. It visits the reservoir as well as Swithland Woods and Swithland Reservoir. Just to the north of the site there's the pretty village of Barrow upon Soar. There's some nice walks along the Grand Union Canal and a fine waterside pub to visit here. Just to the south of Bradgate Park you'll find the secluded Groby Pool. The small lake is a good place for wildlife watching and also includes some adjacent bluebell woods. The woodland trust's Martinshaw Wood is located about half a mile south west from here too. It's another peaceful local place for bird watching and easy trails. The National Forest Way passes through the area. The long distance trail takes you to several of the highlights of the National Forest area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Leicestershire Walks page."
