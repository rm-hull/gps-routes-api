  "description": "This beautiful village in Aberdeenshire is a popular base for exploring the Cairngorms National Park. In the village there's pleasant walks along the River Dee and the \nMorrone Birkwood National Nature Reserve with its woodland and wildlife. This walk visits the historic Braemar Castle which lies just to the north of the village. There's some nice trails to follow around the grounds of the highly photogenic castle. The castle dates back to the 17th century with an audio tour detailing its fascinating history. To continue your outing head west to visit the nearby Linn of Quoich where there are some splendid waterside trails and lots of picturesque waterfalls to see.",
