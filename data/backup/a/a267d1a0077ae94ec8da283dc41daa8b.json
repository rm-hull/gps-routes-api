  "description": "This pretty village sits in a lovely spot on the Northumberland coast near Whitley Bay and Blyth. This walk takes you along the sea front to the wildlife rich St Mary's Nature Reserve. You can start the walk at the Seaton Sluice Car Park next to the beach at the northern end of the village. From here you can head south past Rocky Island, Colywell Bay and Crag Point before coming to St Mary's Nature Reserve next to St Mary's Island. The area is a popular bird watching site with the island itself also accessible at low tide by crossing the causeway. Here you can visit the photogenic lighthouse and enjoy fine views towards Whitley Bay. The route runs for about 2 miles with the option of extending it by continuing on to Whitley Bay where you could pick up the Whitley Bay to Tynemouth Walk .",
