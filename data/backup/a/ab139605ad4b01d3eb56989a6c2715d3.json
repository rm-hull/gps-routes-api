  "description": "This attractive village is located in the Craven district of North Yorkshire. There's some lovely country and riverside trails to follow through nearby Ribblesdale here. There's also a railway station and a fine 18th century pub to visit. This circular walk from the village starts from the train station and explores the countryside to the east of the settlement. You'll enjoy waterside walking through the pretty valley of the Long Preston Beck where there's lots of birdlife to look out for. The walk starts at the train station and heads east through the village to pick up the Scalehaw Lane. Follow the track east and it will take you to the beck where you turn north towards Scalehaw Hill and the New Pasture Plantation. You can then pick up the New Pasture Lane and follow it west before turning south on Green Gate Lane to return to the village.",
