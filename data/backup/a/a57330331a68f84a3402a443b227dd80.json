  "description": "Woodhall Spa is a very attractive former spa town on the edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds . There are good walking opportunites with several peaceful woods, two rivers and lots of attractive countryside to explore. This walk explores the lovely Pinewoods in the village before following the Viking Way to nearby Horncastle . On the way there's woodland trails, countryside views and riverside paths along the River Bain. The walk starts off in the centre of village at The Pinewoods, where there some easy trails and lots of interesting flora and fauna to see. These delightful woods are also notable for the unique Kinema in the Woods. It dates from 1922, and it is the only fully functioning cinema in the UK to employ back projection. In the woods you can also look out for wildlife including great spotted woodpecker and muntjac deer. After exploring Pinewoods you then pick up the waymarked Viking Way and follow it east through Bracken Wood, Highall Wood and Whithall Wood. Shortly after you pick up the River Bain where a riverside footpath will take you all the way into the Roman town of Horncastle. The route follows part of the Spa Trail , a shared cycling and walking trail running along a dismantled railway line.",
