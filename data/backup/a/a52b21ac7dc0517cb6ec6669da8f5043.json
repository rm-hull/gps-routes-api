To the left is Stretham Bridge a former railway bridge built when the line from Shoreham to Horsham was constructed in 1861. It now carries the Downs Link, a long distance cycle path and bridleway. A former Roman ferry crossing was also located nearby probably to the south. Finally, the bush on the right marks the point where the footpath to Stretham Lane begins."

  "description": "This West Sussex based market town is in a fine location for exploring the South Downs National Park and the beautiful River Adur Valley. The town is very pleasant for a stroll with a fine high street and a number of Tudor style half timbered houses and smart Georgian town houses to see. This route from the town uses a section of the Downs Link and riverside footpaths to create a circular route through the area to the north east of Steyning. On the way you'll visit the River Adur and Bramber Castle and enjoy fine views of the countryside of the Adur Valley. The walk starts on the eastern edge of the town where you can pick up the Downs Link and follow it north to Wyckham Farm before reaching the river at Stretham Manor. Here you pick up a riverside path which you can follow south to Upper Beeding and Bramber Castle. The ruined castle dates from the 11th century and also includes the more complete church which was built as part of the castle residences and buildings. It remains in use today. From the castle it is a short walk north back to the start point at the eastern side of Steyning.",

      "content": "Head south west from the town and you can explore the South Downs on the South Downs Way and Monarch's Way long distance trails. The area includes the hill fort at Cissbury Ring where there are splendid views towards Worthing on the south coast. To the east there's one of the scenic highlights of the area at the Devils Dyke. You could also continue south along the river to reach the coast at Shoreham by Sea. Head north along the river and you could visit the neighbouring village of Henfield. The attractive settlement includes some historic buildings including a 13th century church and 17th century pub. The circular Henfield Walk explores the area, visiting the River Adur and the surrounding farmland. Just to the south is the Lancing Ring Nature Reserve. The reserve is a great place for wildlife walks with splendid views over the Adur Valley from the high points. For more walking ideas in the area see the South Downs Walks and Sussex Walks pages."
