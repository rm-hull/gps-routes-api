  "description": "This walk follows a section of the South West Coast Path from Boscastle to Crackington Haven Walk, on the Cornish coast. It's a splendid elevated section with spectacular sheer cliffs and tremendous views from the high point on Cornwall's coast. The route runs for a distance of just over 6 miles along an undulating cliff top path. Starting in Boscastle from the pretty harbour you head north to the interesting rock formations at Penally Point. You continue to Pentargon and Beeny Cliff before coming to the highest point on the Cornish coastline at High Cliff. There's some excellent views from this elevated spot. The route continues to the wonderful headland at Cambeak before descending into Crackington Haven. It's a popular spot with a lovely beach and a fine sea front pub. There's also the option of visiting the historic Norman church at the little hamlet of St Gennys. To continue your walking in the area head south on the Boscastle to Tintagel Walk to visit the splendid coastal castle of Tintagel .",
