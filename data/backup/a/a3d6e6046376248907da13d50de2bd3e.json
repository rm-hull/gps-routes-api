Unusually intact interior including arcades, complete surviving late medieval roofs and the extensive survival of late medieval window tracery. The double nave form is relatively rare in the county, being more common in Powys\"."

  "description": "This small Carmarthenshire village is located just south of Llandovery on the western side of the Brecon Beacons National Park. Myddfai is a popular place for tourists with a 14th century Grade I listed church and an excellent, energy efficient visitor centre. The centre has a craft shop, gift shop and a fine cafe. The village is also the home of Llwynywermod, a royal residence used by the Prince of Wales. For walkers the long distance Cambrian Way passes right through the village. The epic trail is a great way of further exploring the area on a waymarked footpath. The trail could be followed north to Llandovery where you can link up with the Heart of Wales Line Trail . This trail explores the Heart of Wales Railway Line visiting some of the significant old stations and viaducts along the route. This circular walk from the village climbs to the wonderful viewpoint at Mynydd Myddfai before descending to the nearby Usk Reservoir . Here you can enjoy waterside and woodland walks with fantastic views of the Black Mountains.",
