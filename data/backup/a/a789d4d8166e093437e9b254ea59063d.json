  "description": "Explore the family home and garden of Sir Winston Churchill on this short walk in Westerham, Kent. The hillside gardens include pretty lakes created by Churchill himself, a kitchen garden which produced fruit and vegetables for 10 Downing Street and the Marycot - a playhouse designed for his youngest daughter Mary. There is also an orchard with the colourful Japanese crab apple and a pretty rock garden. You can also explore the 800 acres of the wider estate with miles of woodland paths and fabulous views of the Weald from Mariners Hill. The walk also visits Toy's Hill with more than 200 acres (81 hectares) of woodland, abundant wildlife and more splendid views of the surrounding Kent countryside. In the house the rooms remain much as they were when he lived there with a number of his fine paintings on display. Chartwell is located just a few miles from Sevenoaks and Oxted. The Greensand Way walking route runs past the estate so there is scope for continuing your walk along this trail if you have time. You could pick up the trail and head to the nearby Toys Hill. Here you will find a wonderful viewpoint with views over the Weald of Kent. The area also includes the delightful Emmetts Garden and has strong connections with Octavia Hill, founder of the National Trust.",
