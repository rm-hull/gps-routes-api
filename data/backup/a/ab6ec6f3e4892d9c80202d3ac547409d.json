  "description": "This Dartmoor village is located just to the north of Tavistock on the River Tavy. The village is just off both the West Devon Way and the Dartmoor Way long distance footpaths. The pretty settlement includes a 14th century church and a noteworthy 15th century pub for refreshments after your walk. This circular walk from the village uses part of the West Devon Way and local country lanes to visit the neighbouring village of Mary Tavy. On the walk you can enjoy views of the River Tavy and the surrounding countryside. There's also a visit to the photogenic Harford Bridge at the southern end of the walk. To continue your walking in the area head north east to visit Tavey Cleave and Hare Tor . There's lovely riverside trails with waterfalls, interesting vegetation and several large granite tors. The wonderful Lydford Gorge is also near here and another major local walking highlight.",
