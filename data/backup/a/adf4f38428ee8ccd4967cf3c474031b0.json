  "description": "This large park in Stoke-on-Trent has some nice walking and cycling paths to try. In the park you'll find woodland trails and a large lake. There's also a small hill with nice views over the city and surrounding countryside. There's a good sized car park off Chell Street where you can start your exercise. From here you can pick up the trails around the lake and past the children's play area. North of the lake you can climb to the viewpoint before enjoying refreshments at the lakeside snack bar. To continue your exercise in the area you could head to the nearby Park Hall Country Park. This large park has miles of trail which are great for dog walking and cycling.",
