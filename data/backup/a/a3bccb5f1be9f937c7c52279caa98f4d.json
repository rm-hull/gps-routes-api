  "description": "This walk from Haywards Heath visits two of the highlights of the area at Ardingly Reservoir and Wakehurst Place. The walk uses a section of the High Weald Landscape Trail to take you to the lovely lake and the wonderful Botanic Gardens. The walk starts in the town centre, near to the train station. From here you head north, passing the golf course before coming to Copyhold Lane. Here you pick up the High Weald Landscape Trail which continues north through River's Wood to Ardingly Reservoir. The 198 acre reservoir is also a nature reserve with a variety of habitats including wetland, reedbed, deciduous woodland, hazel coppice and haymeadow. You can look out for wildlife such as Great crested grebe and kingfishers in this area. There's a nice footpath running along the eastern side of the water which will lead you up to Wakehurst Place which is the country estate of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. There are 465 acres to explore on a series of delightful footpaths. Features include beautiful botanic gardens, woodland, lakes, formal gardens and an Elizabethan house. After exploring the park, the walk returns to Haywards Heath on the same paths. To continue your walking in the area you could pick up the Sussex Border Path, just to the east of the reservoir at the village of Horsted Keynes. This will lead you north to the attractive Weir Wood Reservoir which has a nice trail running around the perimeter. Other walking highlights near the town include the delightful gardens at Sheffield Park and Nymans Gardens. There's also the long distance Diamond Way and Brighton Way running through the town too. The latter will take you onto the beautiful South Downs which is not far from the town.",
