  "description": "Follow footpaths across Corsham Park on this walk near Chippenham. You can start your walk in the town centre and pick up the footpath on the eastern edge of the town. It takes you across the park with its pretty lake and woodland. In the summer months you can visit the historic house, with its significant art collection and beautiful gardens. The house is located close to Lacock Abbey and Village where you can extend your walk. The abbey grounds include a woodland garden, rose garden, an apple orchard and the Bide Brook stream.",

      "content": "Just to the north you could pay a visit to the Cotswolds village of Biddestone. The settlement is very quaint with a village pond, attractive cottages and views of the Bybrook River which meanders through the area. Head west and you could explore the delightful village of Box. The village includes nice trails along the By Brook and the famous Box railway tunnel created by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in the early 19th century. Near here there's also Colerne where there's nearly 90 historic listed buildings including a 13th century church and a noteworthy 17th century stone pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cotswolds Walks and Wiltshire Walks pages."
