  "description": "Follow footpaths across Corsham Park on this walk near Chippenham. You can start your walk in the town centre and pick up the footpath on the eastern edge of the town. It takes you across the park with its pretty lake and woodland. In the summer months you can visit the historic house, with its significant art collection and beautiful gardens. The house is located close to Lacock Abbey and Village where you can extend your walk. The abbey grounds include a woodland garden, rose garden, an apple orchard and the Bide Brook stream.",
