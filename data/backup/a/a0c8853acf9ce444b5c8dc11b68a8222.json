In the nineteenth century the Congresbury Yeo powered watermills at Ubley, Wrington and Congresbury as well as a small paper mill at Compton Martin just below this millpond. Paper making had ceased by 1830 and the mill was converted to grind grist or animal feed. It later served as a rag store, barn and cider mill."

  "description": "This pretty Somerset village is in a fine location for exploring the Chew Valley on foot. In the village there's a signficant Norman church and the picturesque millpond which is the source of the Congresbury Yeo River. Both Blagdon Lake and Chew Valley Lake are within walking distance of the village. These large bodies of water have fine waterside walks and cycling trails to try. The Monarch's Way and the Limestone Link also pass through the village. These waymarked long distance footpaths are a great way of exploring the surrounding countryside of the Mendip Hills. This walk from the village follows a section of the Limestone Link and country lanes west to visit one of the major highlights of the area at the spectacular Cheddar Gorge. On the way you will also pass Velvet Bottom a wildlife rich nature reserve in a dry limestone valley, located just to the north east of Cheddar Gorge. Ubley Warren Nature Reserve with its wide variety of interesting plants can also be found in this area.",
