    "description": "This walk takes you into the pretty Beresford Dale National Nature Reserve in the Derbyshire Peak District. It's a very peaceful and attractive area of the Dove Valley with riverside paths, weirs, woodland, wildflowers and birdlife to enjoy. This circular walk starts from the village of Hartington. From the western side of the village you can pick up a footpath heading south into Beresford Dale. You'll soon come to the reserve where you'll pass a series of weirs, wooden footbridges, limestone scenery and a Pike Pool. Just before Wolfscote Dale the route turns around, picking up other footpaths and country lanes to return you to the village. Back in the village you can enjoy refreshments at the Devonshire Arms pub. The quaint old 17th century pub has a lovely large beer garden to relax in during the warmer months. To extend your walk continue south to Wolfscote Dale, Milldale and the hugely popular Dovedale. It's one of the highlights of the area and includes the iconic Dovedale Stepping Stones.",
