  "description": "The peaceful and lush green countryside of Ireland's River Boyne Valley is a popular place for walkers. There's riverside and canalside trails plus some wonderful ancient history at Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with some significant megalithic art. The valley is located less than an hours drive north of Dublin and about 1.5 hours drive from Belfast. This walk in the valley takes you from Navan to Knowth along the Boyne Navigation Canal towpath and other riverside footpaths along the Boyne River. Along the way there's pretty locks, peaceful woodland and some fine views over the surrounding lush countryside of the valley. The route runs along a flat path for a distance of just under 16km. Start the walk in the People's Park in the town of Navan in County Meath. From here head north east along the towpath passing Rowley's Lock and Dunmoe Castle. You continue past Coker's Wood and Slane where you'll pass on the opposite side to Slane Castle. The castle is well worth a visit with an interesting history, a whiskey distillery, woodland trails and a natural amphitheatre which has been used for many concerts. Just east of the castle the walk finishes at Morgan's Lock near Knowth. Here you could visit the Neolithic passage grave and ancient monument. The site contains around one-third of all known megalithic art in western Europe. It is classed as a National Monument of Ireland.",

      "content": "To continue your walking around the valley head south to visit the Hill Of Tara. The hill is one of several noteworthy ancient sites in the valley. You can enjoy a stroll around the scenic hill which is the site of some of the most significant archaeological finds in Ireland. A half hour drive to the west there's more local history at Fore Abbey. The ancient abbey dates back to the 13th century and includes a circular walk taking you around the historic buildings and the village of Fore. Near here there's also the fascinating Loughcrew. This ancient site includes includes a number of tombs thought to date to the 4th millennium BC. There are great views from the hill top to enjoy here as well. For more waterside walking try the Royal Canal which runs through the southern part of the valley and links with the River Shannon. To the north east there's the Rathescar Lakeside Walk to try. The pretty lake has a pleasant waterside path and nature trails through peaceful woodland. Just to the south west is the medieval Trim Castle where there are some pleasant grounds and more riverside trails. Just to the east of Slane Castle is the site of the famous Battle of the Boyne. The area includes an excellent visitor centre and a number of walkways taking you around the site of the historic 17th century battle. There are also pretty gardens and walks along the River Boyne and the Boyne Canal. You can reach the site from nearby Drogheda by following the Drogheda Boyne Greenway west from the town. The shared cycling and walking trail utilises sections of boardwalk and riverside paths along the River Boyne to reach the battlefield. It's a pleasant way to reach the site without a car."
