  "description": "This walk visits Bradfield and the lovely Wrabness Nature Reserve in Essex. The walk starts off from the village of Bradfield though you could start from the reserve car park on Wall Lane at postcode CO11 2TE. Wrabness train station is also nearby. From Bradfield you can pick up the Essex Way and follow it east along the coast to the Wrabness Reserve and the Oakfield Wood Reserve. You can head up to Wrabness Point and Stone Point where there is a beach and fine views across the River Stour estuary. There's also lots of wildlife to look out for with plenty of waders in the estuary. Keep your eyes peeled for black-tailed godwit, turnstones, knot, owls, yellowhammers, whitethroats, turtle dove, song thrush, nightingales and bullfinches. You can extend the walk by continuing east along the path to Copperas Bay and Stour Wood.",
