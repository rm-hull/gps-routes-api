The recent addition of ducks seems to have cut back on foliage problem, 20 years ago it was not uncommon to see men with scythes cutting it back. It dates back to at least the 1700's and the name Pidgeon searched online will bring up a better history. It is fed by the raised section across the B3181."

For walkers there's lots of good options in the nearby Blackdown Hills AONB and through the pretty Culm Valley. This walk in the town takes you along the pretty mill leat walk on the eastern side of the settlement. There's a nice surfaced footpath taking you along the pretty waterway to the town's historic mills.",
