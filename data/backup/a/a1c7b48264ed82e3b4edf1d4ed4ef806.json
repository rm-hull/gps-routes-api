  "description": "This long circular walk explores the countryside around the Kent town of Hythe. It uses a number of the long distance trails which pass through the area. You'll enjoy canalside paths, hill climbs, woodland trails and fabulous views of the North Downs and the coast. The route starts at the train station and immediately picks up the Royal Military Canal Path and heads west towards West Hythe. Here you turn north and climb along the Saxon Shore Way to Pedlinge, passing Folks' Wood on the way. The route continues through Chesterfield Wood, skirting the edge of Brockhill Country Park. In the park you can enjoy waymarked woodland trails, a lake, open grassland and meadows. The next stage takes you to Tolsford Hill where you can see the BT Tower. Around here the walk reaches its high point at over 600ft with splendid views over the surrounding area. After passing the tower you descend past Etchinghill to Asholt Wood on the Elham Valley Way. You can either skirt the edge of the wood or follow the path along the dismantled railway line on this section. Just north of the woods you have the option of picking up the North Downs Way and following it south east to Peene Quarry Country Park and the Folkestone White Horse. At Peene you pass the Channel Tunnel Terminal and Newington before heading through Scene Wood and the Sene Valley Golf Course. This leads you through Hythe and back to the canal where you pick up the waterside path through the town centre, before returning to the finish point back at the train station. To extend your walking in the area you could head east along the canal and then pick up the coast path towards Folkestone. On the way you can pay a visit to the delightful Lower Leas Coastal Park where there are lovely gardens with a wide variety of interesting flora and fauna to see.",

      "content": "Continue south along the England Coast Path and you could pick up the Dymchurch Walk and visit the coastal village with its old Martello Towers and Redoubt Fort. The trail will take you to the noteworthy Dungeness Nature Reserve where you'll find an expansive shingle beach, lakes, the old lightouse and the nuclear power station. Just to the west on the canal you'll find the village of Lympne. Here you can visit the splendid Port Lympne Wild Animal Park, the medieval Lympne Castle and the ancient Portus Lemanis Roman Fort. In Folkestone the splendid East Cliff and Warren Country Park is one of the area highlights. Here you can enjoy some well laid out paths, a visitor centre, cafe, eye catching steep cliffs and more spectacular views. For more walking ideas in the area see the Kent Walks page."
