  "description": "This circuit around Hay on Wye takes you into the Brecon Beacons National Park on the Offa's Dyke Path. It then climbs to the magnificent viewpoint of Hay Bluff, a few miles to the south of the town. The walk starts from Hay Castle which was originally constructed in the 11th century. In the 17th century a Jacobean mansion house was built alongside the medieval keep and the property became a private home. From here you can pick up the waymarked Offa's Dyke Path and head south towards Tack Wood. The path climbs to Hay Bluff which lies in the Black Mountains on the border of Wales and England. From the 677 m (2,221 ft) summit there are fabulous views over the Black Mountains, Brecon Beacons and the English county of Herefordshire. After taking in the views, the path then loops round before descending back towards Tack Wood. Here you can continue along the nice country lane or follow footpaths towards Cusop Dingle and follow the Dulas Brook back to the town. Here you can enjoy a stroll around the pleasant streets and visit one of the many bookshops which the town is famous for. If you are visiting in late May to June you can enjoy the Hay Festival. The popular literary festival draws about 80,000 visitors to see and hear big literary names from all over the world. To continue your walking in the area you could climb to Lord Hereford's Knob (Twmpa) which is located just over a mile to the south west of Hay Bluff. The Wye Valley Walk also passes through the town, running along the Wye River, just behind the town. You could pick up the riverside trail and follow it south west towards Llowes and Glasbury.",
