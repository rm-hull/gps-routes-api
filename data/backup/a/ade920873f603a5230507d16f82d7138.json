  "description": "A circular walk around this pretty Cotswolds town using the Cotswold Way and other public footpaths. It's about a 5 mile walk so should take roughly 2 to 3 hrs to complete. The walk starts in the centre of the town and takes you through farmland to Wortley before climbing through the woodland on Wortley Hill. The route then passes Newark Park where you have the option to explore the lovely 700 acre estate. The extensive park includes lakes, gardens and more woodland trails. After leaving the park the route descends to Coombe and Holywell before returning to the town. To extend your walk you can visit Westridge Woods just to the north west of the town. You can follow the Cotswold Way to the site which includes the Tyndale Monument . The 19th century tower was built in honour of William Tyndale, a translator of the New Testament who was born in the area. The tower is next to the geologically significant Nibley Knoll which shows a thick section of Lower and Middle Jurassic rocks.",
