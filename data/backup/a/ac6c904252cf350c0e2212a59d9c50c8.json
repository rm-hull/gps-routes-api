  "description": "This pretty Surrey based village is a great place to start a walk. There's numerous trails to follow into the surrounding woodland and countryside of the North Downs and the Surrey Hills. There's also a train station making the area accessible to those of you coming by public transport. This circular walk from the village visits the neighbouring settlement of Shere before linking up with the North Downs Way and exploring Netley Heath and Hackhurst Downs. The route then goes on to visit Abinger Roughs, another popular place for local walks. The Roughs lie just east of the village and include some peaceful woodland trails with carpets of bluebells and Rhododendrons to see in the spring months. It's easy to extend the walk by heading into the nearby Ranmore Common and Abinger Common .",
