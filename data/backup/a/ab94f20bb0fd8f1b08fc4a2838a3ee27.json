  "description": "This walk visits the stunning Kisdon Force, East Gill and Catrake Force waterfalls in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The walk begins in Keld and first heads to the nearby Catrake Force. It's a beautiful spot comprising of a series of 4 steps each with its own small waterfall. The largest single drop being about 20 feet (6.1 m). You then head to East Gill Force - it has two main torrents: the upper falls have an impressive 4.5 metre drop whilst the lower section is a series of stepped cascades that fall three metres as East Gill enters the River Swale. The walk continues east to Kisdon Force waterfalls. These stunning falls drop 10 metres (33 ft) over two cascades and are surrounded by Kisdon Force Woods with mixed broad-leaved woodland including ash, wych elm and rowan trees. The walk then continues along the River Swale towards Muker, passing more pretty waterfalls along the way. You return on the eastern side of the river to Keld. This is a lovely, fairly easy walk with river views, waterfalls, and woodland. The Pennine Way walking trail runs past the falls so you could pick this up if you wanted to continue your walk. Also nearby is the fascinating Gunnerside Gill. Our Circular Walk in Swaledale visits the falls and Gunnerside Gill from the village of Gunnerside. There's also the Muker to Keld Walk, another circular route which visits the waterfalls and uses a section of the Pennine Way long distance trail. The video below shows a similar route but this time starting from Muker. The walk below starts from Keld for more direct access to the falls.",
