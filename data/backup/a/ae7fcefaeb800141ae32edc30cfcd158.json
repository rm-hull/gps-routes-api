  "description": "A walk from Chippenham, through the countryside to the lovely Lacock Abbey and Village. It's about a 3 mile walk on fairly flat paths with views of the River Avon and some pretty countryside to enjoy along the way. Start the walk on the river, just to the south of the train station. Footpaths then head south to Rowden Manor, Cuckoo Bush Farm and Reybridge before arriving at Lacock. Visit the abbey grounds and you can follow delightful footpaths to a woodland garden, rose garden, the apple orchard and then along the Bide Brook stream. Lacock Village also has picturesque streets and historic buildings which have retained their charm through the years. There's quaint cottages, the old workhouse, the village tithe barn, the old lock-up and the church. The North Wiltshire Rivers Route runs past the village so is a good option if you would like to continue your walk. You could follow the route back to Chippenham on alterative paths to create a circular walk. It will take you back to the town via Notton and the western side of the town.",

      "content": "Just to the west of Chippenham you could visit the neighbouring village of Biddestone. The settlement is very quaint with a village pond, attractive cottages and views of the Bybrook River which meanders through the area. Near here is the worthy village of Box. The village includes more nice trails along the By Brook and the famous Box railway tunnel created by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in the early 19th century. Near here there's also Colerne where there's nearly 90 historic listed buildings including a 13th century church and a noteworthy 17th century stone pub. For more walking ideas in the area see the Wiltshire Walks and North Wessex Downs Walks pages."
