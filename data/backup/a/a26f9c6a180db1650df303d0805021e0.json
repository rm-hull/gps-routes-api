  "description": "The Shropshire based village of Wistanstow lies just to the north of Craven Arms in the beautiful Shropshire Hills. This walk from the village visits a well loved local historical site. You can reach Flounders' Folly by following footpaths east from Wistanstow, passing the Quinny Brook and Strefford Wood on the way. This will take you to Callow Hill where you can climb to the Grade II listed folly which was built in 1838 by Benjamin Flounders. On certain days you can even climb the tower and enjoy wonderful views to the Malvern Hills, the Black Mountains of Wales and Cader Idris. To continue your walking in the area you can enjoy some more fine views at the nearby Wenlock Edge or explore the valley of the River Corve on the Corvedale Three Castles Walk to the east. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Wistanstow. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
