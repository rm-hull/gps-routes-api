  "description": "This stunning walk passes through six of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales - Wharfedale, Washburndale, Nidderdale, Colsterdale, Coverdale, and Wensleydale. The walk runs from Otley to Middleham passing through the Nidderdale AONB. It includes riverside stretches along the River Washburn near the start of the walk, the River Nidd near Pateley Bridge and the River Ure towards the end of the walk at Middleham. You will also pass a series of lovely reservoirs including Fewston Reservoir, Gouthwaite Reservoir and Leighton Reservoir. One of the chief highlights on the route is Jervaulx Abbey - a 12th century former Cistercian monastery it now stands as an enchanting, atmospheric ruin. Also of interest is the English Heritage owned Middleham Castle where there are fantastic views of Wensleydale from the fascinating site.",
