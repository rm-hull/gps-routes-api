In late Spring the steep valley sides are carpeted with Bluebells that line the banks of Holcombe Brook as it passes along the bottom of the valley. The woodland is home to a variety of birds including the Pied Flycatcher. The track to the right of the picture leads up to Redisher Lane."

  "description": "This walk visits the pretty Redisher Wood in Ramsbottom . The woods are a lovely place for a stroll, with sheltered trails along the Holcombe Brook to enjoy. The trails will lead you north west to Simon's Lodge, a picturesque lake which looks particularly lovely surrounded by autumnal trees. Along the way you'll also pass a waterfall that flows impressively after heavy rain. The woods are also a nature reserve so keep your eyes peeled for a variety of woodland birds. To continue your walking in the area pick up the circular Ramsbottom Walk and enjoy river paths along the Irwell Sculpture Trail before a climb to the splendid viepwoint at Peel Tower .",
