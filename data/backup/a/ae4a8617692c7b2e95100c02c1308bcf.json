The smoke plume in the distance, might resemble that of a volcano, but is actually the result of the seasonal burning of gorse and heather."

  "description": "Climb the Yr Eifl mountain group on this challenging circular walk on the Llyn Peninsula. The three summits are collectivley known as 'The Rivals' offering wonderful views over the Llyn Peninsula coastline, the Isle of Man, the mountains of Ireland and the Lake District, as well as the entire sweep of Cardigan Bay. The route visits the peak of Tre'r Ceiri where you will find Britain's best preserved Iron Age hill fort. The walk starts from the Porth-y-Nant upper car park just off the B4417 north of Llithfaen. You then ascend past the Graig Ddu cliffs where you can look down and see the abandoned village of Borth y Nant. You continue to Bwlch yr Eifl where you turn east towards the 561 m (1,841 ft) summit of Yr Eifl. It's a stunning spot. Take a while to soak in the magnificent views of the coast and mountains of Snowdonia. The footpath then descends to Tre'r Ceiri where you can explore the interesting Iron Age stone hut circles before descending the mountain. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Llyn Peninsula Coastal Path which runs past the mountain. Just to the north you could also pay a visit to the Trefor Quarry. There's some good footpaths around the unusual quarry landscape with more fine coastal views from the elevated position of the site.",
