  "description": "Explore 200 acres of woodland and meadows on this circular walk to Chantry Wood and Chantries Hill in Guildford. There's miles of woodland trails to follow with the North Downs Way passing along the northern edge of the forest (you can see some of this section on the google street view link below). There's a fair amount of climbing on the trails with nice views over the surrounding area from the high points. Look out for carpets of pretty bluebells in the springtime and a variety of birdlife all year round. This walk starts at the car park at the eastern end of the woods and follows the North Downs Way across the northern edge before picking up other trails to return you to the start point. Just to the east you will find St Martha's Hill. You can climb to the 574 feet (175 m) summit and enjoy wonderful views of the surrounding area. Also nearby is Newlands Corner where there are woodland trails and open chalk downland with wonderful views over the Surrey Hills. Pewley Down is also just to the north. At the eastern end of the woods a bridleway will take you up to the viewpoint.",
