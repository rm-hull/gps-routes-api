In 1868 local industrialist Joseph Shuttleworth built Hartsholme Hall overlooking the Lake. He died in 1883 leaving his estate to his sons Alfred and Frank who sold it to Nathaniel Clayton Cockburn. The estate was subsequently owned by Colonel Thomas Harding and Lord & Lady Liverpool between 1909 and 1939. The hall and park were requisitioned during the war and the building subsequently fell into ruin with much of the surrounding parkland sold for housing."
