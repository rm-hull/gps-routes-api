  "description": "This walk takes you from Aberfeldy to Kenmore along the River Tay and the River Lyon. The route runs for about 8 miles along a steadily rising path. Along the way there are some wonderful views of the surrounding hills and two historic castles to admire. Start the walk on the Tay Bridge in Aberfeldy where you can cross to the northern side of the Tay. You can then pick up the riverside footpath heading west to Callwood Cottage and the ruins of Comrie Castle. Here you cross to the south at point where the Tay meets with Lyon at the Strath of Appin. Follow paths south along the Tay and they will lead you to Kenmore, passing Taymouth Castle on the way. In Kenmore you can enjoy splendid views over Loch Tay at the point where the river enters the loch. To continue your walking in the area visit the Birks of Aberfeldy . It's a delightful place with a shady gorge and lots of pretty waterfalls to see.",
