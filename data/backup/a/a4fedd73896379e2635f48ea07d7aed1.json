  "description": "This is a nice easy cycle or walking route along the now disused Chiseldon and Marlborough Railway. It starts in Marlborough where you cross the River Kennet and head into the countryside along the path. You will pass through the pretty villages of Ogbourne St Andrew and Ogbourne St George before finishing at Chiseldon. This is a nice easy, traffic free ride so ideal families looking for a safe route. This route is also suitable for walkers looking for a peaceful easy walk. This route links nicely with the Chiseldon Timberland Trail which runs on from Chiseldon to Swindon. You could also visit Coate Water Country Park which has nice cycling and walking trails around a large lake. To continue your cycling around Swindon see our circular Swindon Cycle Route which visits several of the parks in the town.",
