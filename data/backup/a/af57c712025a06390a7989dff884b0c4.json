  "description": "This walk visits Alum Bay, Headon Warren and Headon Hill in the south western corner of the Isle of Wight. You can start the walk from the Alum Bay car park and then follow a section of the Isle of Wight Coast Path up to the Warren. There's some nice footpaths here with excellent views to The Needles and pretty bell heather in the late summer. The area is also great for wildlife with breeding birds on the cliffs including peregrine falcon, fulmar, kittiwake, cormorant, shag, razorbill, puffin and guillemot. You can extend the walk by heading west to visit the Needle Old Battery on the tip of the island. There's also a tourist chairlift which you can ride for some amazing views.",
