  "description": "This walk circles the countryside around Coventry taking you through some fine Warwickshire countryside and a series of interesting villages. The walk starts in the village of Meriden at the geographical centre of England. You then head towards Kenilworth with its impressive castle - described by architectural historian Anthony Emery as the 'finest surviving example of a semi-royal palace of the later middle ages, significant for its scale, form and quality of workmanship'. The route continues towards Stoneleigh and the fascinating Grade I listed Stoneleigh Abbey. With 690 acres of parkland and overlooking the River Avon the abbey is well worth a visit. From Stoneleigh you continue to Wolston where you follow the River Avon to Bretford and then onto Brinklow. Here you join the Oxford Canal towards Bedworth. The final section leads back to Meriden passing Birchley Hays wood and Corley Moor on the way.",
