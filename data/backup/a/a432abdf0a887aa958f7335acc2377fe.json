  "description": "This quiet Anglesey village has some stunning walking paths along the beautiful Maltreath Estuary or Cob Maltraeth. This long circular walk from the village takes you south along the River Cefni and Maltreath Sands to Newborough Forest and Llanddwyn Island. You'll then go onto visit the Newborough Warren Nature Reserve and the neighbouring village of Newborough. Start the walk in the village and then head east to cross Pont Maltreath over the river. You can then pick up a footpath heading south past the wildlife pool into the forest. Here you can enjoy miles of walking and cycling trails leading down to the coast at Llanddwyn Island where you can see the ruins of St Dwynwen's Church and the Twr Mawr lighthouse. There's also sand dunes, beaches and lots of coastal wildlife to see here. The route then heads north through the forest before heading south east to explore Newborough Warren. This section is optional and should only be attempted if the tidal conditions are appropriate. The route then visits Newborough village before heading up to the River Cefni where you can pick up a final riverside path to take you back to Maltreath.",
