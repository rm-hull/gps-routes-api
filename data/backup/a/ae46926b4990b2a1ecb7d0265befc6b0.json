In 1858, the Ludlow M.P. Beriah Botfield erected a limestone cross next to the original stone to commemorate the pedlar. This has since been replaced with a modern replica."

  "description": "This is an exceptionally beautiful walk or cycle through Powys and then into Shropshire. The route runs along a ridge top overlooking Wales on the one side and England on the other with spectacular views for the duration of the ride. It runs for about 15 miles with a gradual descent when going from west to east. You start at Cider House Farm near Kerry and head east to Bishop's Castle passing through Ceri Forest on the way. You will pass through heather moors, woodlands and bilberry rich heaths with fabulous views of the Welsh and Shropshire Hills.",
