  "description": "This large Somerset market town has some nice waterside walking trails to try. There's also some fine architecture with a number of Georgian houses and the attractive Market Hall. This circular waterside walk takes you along the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal and the River Parret Trail which run through the town. The walk starts in the town centre at the Bridgwater Docks Marina in the town centre. Here you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it south. The route then crosses to the river where you can pick up another waterside trail and follow it back into the town. To extend the walk you could follow the waymarked River Parrett trail north to meet with the river at Combwich. The route then continues to the Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve .",
