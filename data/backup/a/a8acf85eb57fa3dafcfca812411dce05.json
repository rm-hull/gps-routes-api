It also needs to cross over Darnall Road / Worksop Road (via an 'acadock' - local pronunciation!). The road dips down sharply to accommodate the canal and railway, giving rise to an area under the bridges often flooded in periods of sudden heavy rain. In the distance, the floodlight towers for the Don Valley Stadium can be seen."

  "description": "Follow the towpath of the Sheffield Canal on this waterside walk in Yorkshire. The canal runs from the Sheffield Canal Basin in the city centre to Tinsley, next to the Meadowhall centre. Along the way there are a number of locks and stone bridges. It's quite a narrow towpath so it's probably best suited for walkers. The canal featured in the opening scene of the 1997 film\u00a0The Full Monty. The route starts at the attractive Victoria Quays in Sheffield. You then head north east through Attercliffe, passing the Don Valley Stadium on the way. You then pass Tinsley Locks before finishing at Meadowhall. The huge indoor shopping centre has plenty of restaurants\u00a0for refreshments at the end of your walk. The River Don also runs to Meadowhall from the city centre so you could return along the Five Weirs Walk . This follows a waterside path along the river and is suitable for cyclists and walkers.",
