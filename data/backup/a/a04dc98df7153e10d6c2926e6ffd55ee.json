  "description": "This Yorkshire town is a great base for walkers with numerous local parks, canalside trails, several nearby reservoirs and riverside paths along the Calder. This walk explores Clarence Park, Holmfield Park and Thornes Park in the town centre. The three parks are all located on the south western side of the town and run alongside each other. In the parks you'll find easy surfaced footpaths taking you to rose gardens, a conservatory, a lake and an aviary. After exploring the parks you could head a short distance south to visit the canalside walk at Horbury and the lovely Pugneys Country Park where there's two large lakes and a nature reserve. Please scroll down for the full list of walks near and around Wakefield. The detailed maps below also show a range of footpaths, bridleways and cycle paths in the area.",
