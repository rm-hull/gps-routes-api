  "description": "This country park is a peaceful area located between Hornchurch and Dagenham. It has four pretty lakes and an environmentally friendly visitor centre. The park can be easily accessed from Dagenham East Station on the District Line. The park is also good for wildlife with various birds to see on the lakes. On the eastern side of the park is the Chase Nature reserve, managed by London Wildlife Trust. There's Horse-grazed meadows, woodland, marshland, ponds, and several rare Black Poplar Trees. It's another great area for wildlife with 200 species of birds recorded at the site. Look out for species such as kingfishers, skylark, little ringed plover, lapwing, great Snipe, pine bunting and spotted crake. To the south is Beam Valley Country Park on the other side of the train line. There's more nice trails here with views of the River Beam which runs through the park. You can start this circular walk from the on site car park at postcode RM10 7BD for your sat navs.",
