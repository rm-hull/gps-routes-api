  "description": "This walk takes you along a lovely stretch of coast between Hoylake and West Kirby on the Wirral Peninsula. The route runs for just over 3 miles using a section of the Wirral Circular Trail. The route starts at Manor Road train station in Hoylake and heads north west to the coast. Here you can pick up the Wirral Circular Trail and follow it south west to Hilbre Point. There's great views over the Dee Estuary to the nearby Hilbre Island from here. These three tidal islands lying at the mouth of the Dee Estuary include Little Eye, Middle Eye and Hilbre island. Together they are designated as the Hilbre Islands Nature Reserve. You can access the islands by foot from West Kirby at low tide. The route then turns south to head into West Kirby, where the route finishes by the Marine Lake. The  man-made saltwater lake is a nice place for a waterside stroll with views across to the Welsh Hills on a clear day. To continue your exercise pick up the popular Wirral Way in West Kirby. You can follow the trail east to visit Wirral Country Park and Thurstaston Common .",
