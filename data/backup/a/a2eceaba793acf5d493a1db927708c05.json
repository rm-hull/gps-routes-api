  "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking trails in this converted coal mining site in Ashby-de-la-Zouch. Cyclists can enjoy two great mountain bike (mtb) trails. There is an easy trail suitable for all abilities and the more challenging Shell Brook Trail which has some jumps and bumps. Walkers can enjoy a short stroll around the lake or explore deeper into the forest on woodland trails. If you look on the open street map below you can see the mtb trails on the eastern side of the park. Less than half a mile to the west you'll find the Moira Furnace. The 36 acre country park includes walking and cycling trails along the Ashby Canal. The National Forest visitor centre and the Donisthorpe Woodland park are also in this area.",
