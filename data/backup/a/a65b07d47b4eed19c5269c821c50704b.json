Even in November, with much of the birdlife elsewhere, the forest is an exciting place."

The pinewoods are a good place to look out for wildlife including Capercaillie and red squirrels. To the north of the town you'll also find the peaceful Lochindorb. The loch has a good walking and cycling path running along its eastern side. From here you can enjoy views across the water to the ruins of Lochindorb Castle which sits on an island in the centre of the loch. In nearby Nethy Bridge you can enjoy a pleasant riverside walk along the River Nethy. To the north east is the splendid Glenlivet Estate where you can enjoy some fine walking and mountain bike trails. There's also the option to visit the famous Glenlivet Whisky Distillery and the delightful village of Tomintoul here. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cairngorms Walks page."
