  "description": "This Hampshire based village has some nice river and country trails to try. The village is also notable for its Norman church, 15th century pub and history of banknote paper manufacture which started in the 18th Century. Overton Mill still produces banknotes for the Bank of England as of 2020. This walk from the village takes you along the River Test to its source, just to the east of Overton. The route then continues to visit the nearby Deane Park. The walk starts in the village, just to the south of the train station, next to the river. You can follow footpaths and country lanes east past Foxdown to Polhampton Ponds. Head south east from here and it will soon take you to the source of the river near Ashe. Here there's an nice old church where you can see pretty snowdrops in the churchyard, during January and Ferbruary. From Ashe follow paths east and they will take you to the neighbouring village of Deane.",
