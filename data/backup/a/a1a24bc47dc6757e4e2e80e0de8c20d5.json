  "description": "This Hampshire based village has some nice river and country trails to try. The village is also notable for its Norman church, 15th century pub and history of banknote paper manufacture which started in the 18th Century. Overton Mill still produces banknotes for the Bank of England as of 2020. This walk from the village takes you along the River Test to its source, just to the east of Overton. The route then continues to visit the nearby Deane Park. The walk starts in the village, just to the south of the train station, next to the river. You can follow footpaths and country lanes east past Foxdown to Polhampton Ponds. Head south east from here and it will soon take you to the source of the river near Ashe. Here there's an nice old church where you can see pretty snowdrops in the churchyard, during January and Ferbruary. From Ashe follow paths east and they will take you to the neighbouring village of Deane.",

The interior is full of charm with a mix of antiques, local artwork and individually sourced furnishings. Outside there's a sun trap garden for warmer days. They do excellent food and can be found on London Road at postcode RG25 3NW for your sat navs. You could start the walk from the car park here as well."

      "content": "Just west of the village there's the small town of Whitchurch to explore. The worthy town has a lovely mill trail visiting the historic Silk Mill and other old buildings on the River Test. In Deane you can pick up the Wayfarer's Walk. The waymarked trail can be followed north towards North Oakley, Ecchinswell and Kingsclere. Here you can enjoy a climb to Watership Down, the hill made famous by Richard Adams' 1972 novel. If you head south east you can visit Basingstoke and try the Basingstoke Canal Walk. If you head a few miles west to St Mary Bourne you could pick up the Test Way and explore the River Test valley on a waymarked path. The village is well worth a visit with rows of picturesque thatched cottages and views of the pretty Bourne Rivulet, a tributary of the River Test. For more walking ideas in the area see the Hampshire Walks page."
