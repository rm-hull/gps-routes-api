  "description": "This is a fairly flat walk or cycle through the beautiful Glen Etive in the Scottish Highlands. The route runs along a long country lane, following the River Etive through the Glen to Loch Etive. It's a special area with the river dotted with pretty waterfalls and surrounded by the striking peaks of Buachaille Etive Mor . Look out for red deer as you make your way through this stunning glen. The route starts from a parking area on the A82 near the King's House Hotel in Glencoe, Argyll. You then pick up the narrow country lane and follow it through the Glen, passing attractive woodland and the lovely Lochan Urr before finishing at Loch Etive. The area also featured in the Bond film Skyfall. You can extend your walk by climbing the wonderful Buachaille Etive Mor ridge. At the western end of the loch you can see the Falls of Lora at Connel.",
