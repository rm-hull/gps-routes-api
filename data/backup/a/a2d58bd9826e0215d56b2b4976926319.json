  "description": "Bedgebury is a great place for cyclists with miles of family cycle tracks and a more challenging mountain bike trail. The gentle 10km trail is perfect for exploring the 2000 acre forest at a leisurely pace on generally flat surfaced paths. Adrenalin junkies can enjoy 13km of single-track mountain biking. It's generally graded as a red trail and has fast sweeping gradual descents and some challenging climbs. There's also cycle shop where you can hire a bike. The forest is also great for walkers with miles of peaceful woodland trails to follow. You can enjoy a stroll around the beautiful Bedgebury Pinetum. This recreational and conservational\u00a0arboretum has 10,000 trees growing across 320 acres\u00a0including the most complete collection of conifers on one site in the world. If you would like to extend your exercise then you can head to the nearby Bewl Water and enjoy a splendid 12.5 mile cycling and walking trail.",
