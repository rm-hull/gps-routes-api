  "description": "This pretty Devon village is located in a lovely spot on Dartmoor. There's nice walks along the River Taw and some fine hill climbs to the surrounding tors. The village itself is also very pretty with a village green, thatched cottages, the old stocks, a holy well and a splendid pub. This circular walk from Belstone visits the neighbouring village of Sticklepath before climbing to the viewpoints at Ramsley Hill, Higher Tor and Belstone Tor. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Dartmoor Way and follow it east through Belstone Cleave to Sticklepath. This section takes you through a wooded gorge along the River Taw, passing Ivy Tor on the way. From Sticklepath you follow the trail to South Zeal and Ramsley Hill where there is a nice viewpoint. Here the route turns west, passing below Cosdon Hill before climbing to Higher Tor and Belstone Tor where there are some interesting rock formations. The route then descends north across Belstone Common, passing the Nine Stones Circle and Watchet Hill before returning to the village.",
