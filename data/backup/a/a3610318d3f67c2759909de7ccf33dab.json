The Sankey can thus be credited with the industrial growth of the region, it was built for Mersey Flats, the sailing craft of the local Rivers. It now forms the heart of the Sankey Valley Park a haven for wildlife and well worth a afternoon stroll or cycle."

  "description": "Enjoy a super, waterside cycle or walk in this country park in Warrington. The valley follows the course of Sankey Brook and the now disused Sankey Canal. The park also contains children's play areas, a maze and a lawned area for families. There is also a meadow, mature woodland and a wetland nature reserve with a variety of birdlife. The path along the Sankey Canal continues all the way to St Helens so you could continue your outing for several more miles if you have time. The Trans Pennine Trail also runs past the park so there is another option here. Our circular walk around Warrington takes you along the River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal, with a visit to the pretty Paddington Meadows Nature Reserve. The riverside reserve is located close to Sankey Valley Park and includes meadows, grazing cattle and a wildflower meadow.",
