  "description": "Enjoy nice trails along the Wansbeck River in the historic market town of Morpeth in Northumberland. The attractive town includes a number of fine Georgian buildings and a lovely riverside park. This circular walk starts in the delightful Carlisle park where there's nice views of the river and the Grade I listed Morpeth Castle. You then head towards Bothal on a mixture of riverside trails and woodland valley paths. There's trails on either side of the river with the route eventually returning to Carlisle Park. From the park you can continue west along the river and then cross the bridge leading to the town. Here you can visit Morpeth Clock Tower, one of the town's most well know landmarks. It was constructed sometime between 1604 and 1634 out of recycled Medieval stone giving it its much older appearance. You should also visit the Morpeth Chantry, a 13th-century chapel that now houses the town's tourist information centre and the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum. To extend the walk continue east towards Ashington and visit the lovely Wansbeck Riverside Country Park. Here you'll find 275 acres of riverside parkland with peaceful woodland trails. Near here is the noteworthy Queen Elizabeth II Country Park with its lovely lakeside trail and fascinating Woodhorn Colliery Museum. Also near Morpeth is the climb to Shaftoe Crags where you can enjoy interesting rock formations and fine views over the Northumberland countryside.",
