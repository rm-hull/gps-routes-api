  "description": "This spectacular beauty spot is 1.5 km long and 60 metres deep cutting through a Highland wilderness rich in flora and fauna. The River Droma runs through the gorge, dropping dramitcally through a series of waterfalls, including the 46 metre Falls of Measach. The gorge was formed at the end of the last ice age and can be viewed from a viewing platform and a Victorian suspension footbridge. The walk below takes you past the gorge and through Braemor Wood to Lael Forest Garden with its 200 different tree species and longer plantation section with waterfalls. Corrieshalloch Gorge is located about 12 miles south of Ullapool where you can climb to the viewpoint at Ullapool Hill and catch the ferry over to Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides.",

      "content": "To the west there's the expansive Loch Maree where you can visit the Victoria Falls and try the circular Beinn Eighe Mountain Trail. There's also the splendid Victoria Falls to visit next to the loch. The rushing falls are named after Queen Victoria who visited the site in 1877. Near here there's also Loch Gairloch where you can pick up the Gairloch Waterfall Walk in the lovely Flowerdale Glen. At nearby Loch Broom there's another hidden gem at the delightful Ardessie Falls in the Ardessie Burn gorge. Head west and you could visit the village of Poolewe and enjoy a stroll around the beautiful Inverewe Garden. The lochside gardens are a lovely place for a stroll with some nice footpaths taking you to subtropical plants, fine lawns and beautiful flowers. You can also enjoy fine views over Loch Ewe in this scenic area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
