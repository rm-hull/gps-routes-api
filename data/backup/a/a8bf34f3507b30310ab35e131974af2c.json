  "description": "This circular walk takes you from Westward Ho to the neighbouring village of Abbotsham in the North Devon Coast AONB. The route runs for just under 6 miles with some moderate climbs along the way. The opening section runs along the South West Coast Path to Abbotsham Cliff and Green Cliff with some splendid coastal views from the cliff top path. At Green Cliff you turn east to follow inland trails to Abbotsham, passing Greencliff Farm on the way. From Abbotsham you can follow quiet country lanes north back to Westward Ho via Pusehill. There's some splendid views over the lovely Devon countryside to the coast from these elevated paths.",
