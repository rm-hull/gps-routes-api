  "description": "This walk follows a nice section of the South West Coast Path from Croyde Bay to Saunton Sands. It's about a 2 mile walk with a small climb on the way. The walk starts from the public car park at Croyde Bay. From here you can follow the coastal path south past the extensive Croyde Burrows Dunes. There's some nice paths around the dunes if you'd like to explore them further. Here you can also pick up a country lane and follow it east into Croyde if you'd like to explore the village. This route continues south past Chesil Cliff House before coming to Saunton Down. From the elevated position of the Down there's fine views down to Saunton Sands and Braunton Burrows below. After crossing Saunton Down the route finishes on the expansive beach at Saunton Sands. If you wanted to turn it into a circular walk you could follow a public footpath north behind the Saunton Hotel which would take you into Croyde village. If you continue south you can explore the beautiful Braunton Burrows nature reserve. The reserve covers nearly 900 hectares making it the second largest\u00a0dune system in England. At the southern end of the reserve you will find the estuaries of the Rivers Taw and Torridge at the scenic Crow Point . There's some lovely riverside paths to try here as well. If you head north from Croyde you can visit Baggy Point . The dramatic headland provides great views back down to Croyde Bay. You can visit the point and the pretty village of Woolacombe on our Woolacombe to Croyde Walk .",
