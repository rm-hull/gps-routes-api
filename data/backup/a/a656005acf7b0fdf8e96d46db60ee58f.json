  "description": "This walk in Durham explores the University Botanic Gardens before heading into the adjacent Houghall Woods. Start the walk from the car park at the Botanic gardens, just of Hollinside Lane, south of the river. The 10 hectare site has some pleasant footpaths taking you to streams, a woodland garden, artwork pieces, a Carboniferous Garden and glasshouses. Just to the east of the site there's some pleasant woodland trails to pick up around Houghall Woods. In the winter months you can see lots of snowdrops in the gardens, while carpets of bluebells are a real treat during the spring months in the woodland areas. To extend the walk head a mile east and you can pick up the circular walk around the delightful village of Shincliffe. There's more shady trails and river views on the long distance Weardale Way in this area.",
