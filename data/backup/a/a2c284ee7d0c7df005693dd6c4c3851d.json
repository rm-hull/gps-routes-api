  "description": "Enjoy a pleasant riverside stroll through this small market town, on this circular walk. Thirsk is  an attractive town with a\u00a0large\u00a0medieval\u00a0market square and some interesting Georgian architecture.\u00a0The rushing waters of the Cod Beck River and fine views towards the Hambleton Hills and Yorkshire Dales make it a very popular place for a walk. The walk starts in the centre of town and picks up footpaths along the Cod Beck river. You follow the river north to the village of South Kilvington before turning west towards the woodland of the Underwood Plantation. You then turn south to head through the countryside to New Thirsk, before returning to the town centre. You can then head south towards Sowerby Flats and explore the delightful Georgian village street of Sowerby. The town was the home of the authour James Herriot. You can explore the villages and countryside associated with his work on the Herriot Way long distance trail. There's also a musuem at Skeldale House in the Kirkgate of Thirsk. It was the surgery of local vet James Wight, better known by his pen name, James Herriot. The museum\u00a0tells the history of veterinary science and is one of the most popular attractions in the town. Thirsk is only a few miles east of the North York Moors National Park. Here you can enjoy a waterside walk around the nearby Gormire Lake or visit the fascinating 12th century ruins of Byland Abbey . You could also visit Sutton Bank and the Kilburn White Horse which are also close by. Sutton Bank is a high point in the Hambleton Hills and commands splendid views over the North York Moors, the\u00a0Vale of York\u00a0and the\u00a0Vale of Mowbray. The Cleveland Way long distance trail also runs through the eastern section of the park and is another good option for extending your walking in the Thirsk area.",
