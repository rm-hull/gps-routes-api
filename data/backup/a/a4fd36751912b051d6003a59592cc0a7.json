  "description": "This walk visits Hedgecourt Lake near East Grinstead in Surrey. The lake is located just to the north west of the town near Felbridge. It's a pleasant place for a stroll with public footpaths leading along the northern side of the lake and into the surrounding woodland. The area is run as a nature reserve by Surrey Wildlife Trust and includes an ancient mill pond and wide variety of wildlife. You can start the walk from the public car park on the eastern side of the water and then pick up paths heading west. Look out for various water loving birds on the water as you go. The lake is also used for fishing. The Tandridge Border Path runs past the lake. The long distance circular walk provides an opportunity for exploring the area further. You could also pick up the Lingfield Walk and visit the nearby Lingfield Wildlife Area and the British Wildlife Centre.",
