  "description": "This circular walk makes use of the Cumbria Coastal Way and Cistercian Way to take you on a tour of the area surrounding this lovely coastal town. Grange-over-Sands is located on Morecambe Bay on the edge of the Lake District National Park. The walk starts on the wonderful long promenade where there are super views over the sands towards Arnside Knott , Silverdale and the Lakeland fells. You then pass through the pretty ornamental gardens and climb towards Cartmel, passing Eggerslack Wood and Hampsfell as you go. From the high points on Hampsfell there are splendid views over the coastline and countryside. Here you'll also find the Hampsfell Hospice, a limestone tower built in 1846 by the vicar of Cartmel. Cartmel is a delightful little village with pretty cottages and the River Eea running through it. It is also home to the fascinating 12th century Cartmel Priory. From Cartmel you continue through the countryside to Cark before returning to the coastline at Lenibrick Point. You then return to Grange-over-Sands along the coast and then through the countryside, passing Allithwaite on the way.",
