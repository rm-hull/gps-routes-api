  "description": "This walk follows the footpaths around White Moss Common in the Lake District. The area consists of a series of nice footpaths taking you through woodland and meadows between Rydal Water and Grasemere Lake. On the way look out for picturesque waterfalls and pretty bluebells in the spring time. The walks start from the good sized White Moss Common car park off the A591 near Rydal Water , Grasmere Lake and the town of Ambleside . You then pick up the trails taking you through shady woodland towards the section of the River Rothay that runs between Rydal Water and Grasmere. It's a pretty area with picnic tables and the option of crossing a bridge and heading to Grasmere Lake. This route heads north to White Moss Common, passing Lady Wood and White Moss Tarn. You then pick up the Coffin Route which takes you across the pretty Dunney Beck. You then head south returning to the car park. To extend your walk you could head east to Rydal Mount and Rydal Hall along the Coffin Route . Heading west will take you to Grasmere passing Dove Cottage where William Wordsworth lived from 1799 to 1808. The climb to the pretty Alcock Tarn also starts from the White Moss car park. It takes you through the common to the elevated tarn where there are wonderful views over Grasmere.",
