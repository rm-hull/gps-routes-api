  "description": "This walk follows the footpaths around White Moss Common in the Lake District. The area consists of a series of nice footpaths taking you through woodland and meadows between Rydal Water and Grasemere Lake. On the way look out for picturesque waterfalls and pretty bluebells in the spring time. The walks start from the good sized White Moss Common car park off the A591 near Rydal Water, Grasmere Lake and the town of Ambleside. You then pick up the trails taking you through shady woodland towards the section of the River Rothay that runs between Rydal Water and Grasmere. It's a pretty area with picnic tables and the option of crossing a bridge and heading to Grasmere Lake. This route heads north to White Moss Common, passing Lady Wood and White Moss Tarn. You then pick up the Coffin Route which takes you across the pretty Dunney Beck. You then head south returning to the car park. To extend your walk you could head east to Rydal Mount and Rydal Hall along the Coffin Route. Heading west will take you to Grasmere passing Dove Cottage where William Wordsworth lived from 1799 to 1808. The climb to the pretty Alcock Tarn also starts from the White Moss car park. It takes you through the common to the elevated tarn where there are wonderful views over Grasmere.",

      "content": "You could head into Grasmere and visit Tweedies for some refreshments in a lovely setting. The large pub has a very large beer garden with plenty of tables. It's a nice place to sit out and relax in after a long walk. You can find it in the village, near the lake, at a postcode of LA22 9SW for your sat navs. If you head east from the car park you could visit Rydal Hall. The Hall has lovely gardens and a tea room with a delightful outdoor seating area with views over a rushing waterfall."

      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "Just to the west of the common you will find the noteworthy Dove Cottage, former home of poet William Wordsworth. During the period of his habitation, William wrote much of the poetry for which he is remembered today, including 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud'. You can explore the fascinating old house and then browse the adjacent museum where you will find exhibits, manuscripts, landscapes and portraits. Stroll into nearby Grasmere and you can also visit his grave in the churchyard of St. Oswald's Church. The Grasmere and Rydal Water Circular Walk passes through the common on its way round the two beautiful lakes. For more walking ideas in the area see the Grasmere Walks and the Lake District Walks pages."
