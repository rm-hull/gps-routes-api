      "caption": "Cally Banks. Finedon Cally Banks is a nature reserve north-east of Wellingborough in Northamptonshire. It is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. The site is linked to the quarry first worked in the 1870s at Finedon Pocket Park. The ore was transported along a specially constructed railway to what is now the reserve. The name Cally Banks comes from the process of burning iron ore to remove impurities, leaving a deposit called calcine which provides the poor soil conditions in which wildflowers flourish. Look for beautiful speckled wood butterflies among these flowers in spring and autumn. Crickets, dragonflies and wetland flora also thrive here, while hawthorn and blackthorn scrub is a haven for warblers."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the Northamptonshire town of Finedon passing the old Finedon Hall and visiting Finedon Pocket Park. The park is a pleasant place for a stroll with woodland, meadow, a tree lined path and the chance to walk on the sleepers from the old quarry rail. The park is nicely ecomanaged by local volunteers and includes woodland containing mainly ash, sycamore and oak. You can extend the walk by continuing west along the dismantled railway from the park. This will take you towards Cally Banks Nature Reserve and the River Ise. In this area you can look out for a variety of butterflies during the warmer months.",
