  "description": "This beautiful country park on the Northumberland coast consists of three miles of beach and sand dunes,  a large freshwater lake, peaceful woodland and meadows. The coastline is simply stunning with a lovely cycling and walking path running alongside the beach. You could continue your outing by following the coast north towards Amble with views of Coquet Island, or head south to Newbiggin-By-The-Sea.  There are several nature reserves in the area so there are plenty of opportunities for bird watching too. This includes the adjacent Hauxley Nature Reserve which is considered to be one of the best bird watching sites in the north east. The park is located near the popular village of Warkworth where you can enjoy a visit to the medieval castle and stroll along the River Coquet on our Warkworth River Walk. You could also pick up the coastal path on the Warkworth to Alnmouth Walk. In Amble you can try the Amble to Warkworth Walk which takes you around the harbour and marina in the town. The Druridge Bay to Amble Walk starts from the park and takes you to Amble on a popular 4 mile stretch of the Northumberland Coast Path .",
