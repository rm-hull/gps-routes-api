  "description": "This walk visits the Rock of Dunamase, an ancient Celtic fortification near Portlaoise, County Laois. From the elevated location of the castle there are wonderful views across the surrounding countryside to the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The site of an early Christian settlement pillaged by the Vikings in 842, Dunamase became one of the most important Anglo-Norman strongholds in Laois. It was part of the dowry of Aoife, the daughter of Diarmuid Mac Murrough, King of Leinster, when she was given in marriage to the Norman conqueror Strongbow in 1170. When Isabel, the daughter of Strongbow and Aoife, wed William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, Dunamase was given as part of her marriage's wedding gift. From 1325 until 1609, the castle belonged to the O\u2019Moore family of Laois, before ownership passed to the Earl of Thomond. It was finally destroyed during the Cromwellian invasion in 1650. To continue your walking in the area you could head north west to pick up the epic Slieve Bloom Way . The long distance waymarked trail runs for 70km, taking you through some of the highlights of the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The Barrow Way can also be picked up just to the east.",
