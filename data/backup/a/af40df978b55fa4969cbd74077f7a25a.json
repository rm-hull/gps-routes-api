  "description": "This walk takes you between two major settlements in the New Forest National Park. The route runs for about 5 miles through the Ranmore, Tarkhill, Park Ground and Pondhead Inclosures. The walk is reasonably flat, with a couple of small climbs along the way. It takes place on a series of nice wide trails many of which are shared with cyclists. You start off just north of Brockenhurst, near Standing Hat and Balmer Lawn . The follow trails north east, past Hollands Wood and the Parkhill Inclosure. The final section into Lyndhurst takes you along Beechen Lane and then crosses the Beaulieu Road onto White Moor. There's a nice open trail here, taking you past the noteworthy Bolton's Bench, located just to the east of the Lyndhurst. The yew-capped hillock is one of the village's best known landmarks. It's a lovely spot with nice views over the surrounding area. To continue your exercise try our Lyndhurst Circular Walk which takes you to some of the highlights surrounding the village. This includes the splendid New Forest Reptile Centre Trail , the Knightwood Oak and the Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary . You could also try the Brockenhurst Circular Walk and visit  Lymington Water, the Perrywood Ironshill Inclosure, the New Copse Inclosure, Standing Hat and Balmer Lawn.",
