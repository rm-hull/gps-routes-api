At present it is marked on the 1:25 000 map as an uncoloured road with no right-of-way dashes, along which are the Kirklees Way and the Spen Valley Heritage Trail. Logically it must therefore be a public road. At the southern end it has the character of a bridleway, but a faded sign indicates a public footpath. The farmer has discouraged the 4x4 brigade and fly tippers from gaining access."
