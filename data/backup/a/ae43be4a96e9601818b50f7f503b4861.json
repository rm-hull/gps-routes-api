  "description": "This walk climbs to Admiral Rodney's Pillar on Breidden Hill in Powys, near Welshpool. The walk starts from the village of Middletown, just to the south of the hill. You can then follow footpaths north past Moel Y Golfa and Middletown Hill before entering Breidden Forest. Woodland trails will then take you up to the top of Breidden Hill where you will find the monument. It was built in 1781\u201382 to commemorate the naval victories of Sir George Brydges Rodney, Admiral of the White during the American War of Independence. From the 366 metre high summit there are also wonderful views over the surrounding countryside. On the route look out for wildlfie including various woodland birds and deer in the forested areas. If you would like a shorter walk there is a car park just to the north of the hill at postcode SY5 9AZ for your sat navs.",
