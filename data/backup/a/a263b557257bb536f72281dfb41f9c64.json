The dam of Gorple Upper Reservoir can be seen to the top right.The reservoirs were constructed between 1927 and 1934. The piles of stone in the centre seem to be the bases of piers which would have carried a bridge over the clough during construction. The remains of several other piers are found just out of sight to bottom left. I presume this would have been a trestle bridge to carry a tramway, perhaps something similar to that at Blake Dean 270422, used in the constructed of the Walshaw Dean reservoirs a few years previously, albeit on a much smaller scale."

On a Monday morning in November 1965 Mr Robert Akrigg, the 55-year-old reservoir keeper, left his home at Gorple Cottages to check water gauges on the reservoir gathering grounds in treacherous weather, and failed to return. After 69 days the snows receded to reveal the body of Mr Akrigg who had lost his life to the sudden and ferocious elements of the wild moors. This tragedy led to the foundation of the Calder Valley Search and Rescue team."

  "description": "Visit the Gorple Reservoirs on this walk in Calderdale. There's some splendid moorland scenery, waterside sections along the reservoirs and a short climb with far ranging views to enjoy. You start the walk from the Clough Foot car park and follow the Pennine Bridleway to Gorple Lower Reservoir. Footpaths then take you along the reservoir to Gorple Upper Reservoir. You can then climb to Gorple Gate across Shuttleworth Moor for great views over the reservoirs. From Gorple Gate you can descend to Widdop Reservoir but this route descends across Black Moor to Gorple Upper Reservoir before returning to the car park on the same tracks. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Hardcastle Crags where you will find a beautiful woodland valley with streams and waterfalls. The Walshaw Dean Reservoir walk also starts from the same location.",
