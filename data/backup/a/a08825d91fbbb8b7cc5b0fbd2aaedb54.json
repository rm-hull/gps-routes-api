  "description": "Climb this hill on the Gloucestershire/Herefordshire border for wonderful views over the two counties, the Forest of Dean and the River Severn. On a clear day you can also see the Cotswolds and the Black Mountains in Wales. The walk starts from the May Hill Common car park about a mile north of the hill. You then climb to the 1000ft (305m) summit where you will find a distinctive row of Corsican pine trees planted to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887. The summit is also covered in interesting flora such as acid grassland, heather and bluebells in the spring. Look out for wildlife including ponies and meadow pipits on the way. You can return the same way or venture into the adjacent Newent Woods and visit Glasshouse Hill  and Castle Hill Wood to extend your walk. The Gloucestershire Way and the Wysis Way both pass the hill so you could also pick up these long distance walking trails. An alternative route to the hill would be to follow the Wysis Way from nearby Mitcheldean.",
