  "description": "This circular walk follows the Leafy Loop trail in Durrow, County Laois. The waymarked footpath is one of the Irish National Looped Walks. On the way there are some lovely views of the Durrow Valley, peaceful woodland trails and fine waterside sections along the River Nore which runs through the area. To continue your walking you could head south to visit the city of Kilkenny where you can try the Kilkenny River and Canal Walk. The easy waterside walk also takes you past the 12th century castle with its lovely grounds and gardens. You can also pick up the waymarked Nore Valley Walk which starts in the city.",
