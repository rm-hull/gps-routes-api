The camp site is easy to get to, as it lies immediately to the east of the A337 between Lyndhurst and Brockenhurst, but for those trying to 'get away from it all' the noise of the busy road must be quite distracting. It is also sited on wet grassland, adjacent to Balmer Lawn: very pretty, but the ground doesn't drain too well! The wooden posts in the foreground (dragons teeth) are found all over the Forest, and are intended to limit vehicular access. The Forestry Commission has recently outlined plans to reduce the size of this campsite, moving this northern boundary further south."

      "caption": "Acorn-eating ponies in Hollands Wood. These ponies were slowly making their way along the edge of Ramnor Inclosure, scrunching up the plentiful acorns that have been falling from the oaks of Hollands Wood. Gorging on acorns can make ponies very sick - possibly resulting in death - and this is one of the practical reasons for the \"pannage\" season when commoners release pigs into the forest. Pigs can eat large quantities of acorns without being poisoned, although the number of swine required to clean up the billions of acorns shed each autumn would be enormous."

The area is located just north of the popular town of Brockenhurst where there are good rail connections. There's a popular campsite here and a decent bridle track that can also be used for cycling. This will lead you towards the adjacent Ramnor Inclosure. You can extend the walk at the nearby Standing Hat and Balmer Lawn where there's more pleasant trails and grazing ponies to see.",
