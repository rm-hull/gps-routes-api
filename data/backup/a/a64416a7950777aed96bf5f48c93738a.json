  "description": "These delightful woods near Brampton are a lovely place for an afternoon stroll. It's popular in the spring months when you can see lots of pretty bluebells and wood anemones. You can start your walk at the Miltonrigg car park at the northern end of the woods, just off the A69. From here you can pick up the accessible trails heading south west to the pretty pond where you can look out for dragonflies and toads. Also keep your eyes peeled for various woodland birds including woodpecker, kestrel, wood warbler and willow tit. To extend your walk you could head north to visit Lanercost Priory. The English Heritage owned Augustinian monastery dates from 1169 and is well worth a visit for its history and architecure. Near here you can also pick up the epic Hadrian's Wall Path and visit the fascinating Birdoswald Roman Fort.",
