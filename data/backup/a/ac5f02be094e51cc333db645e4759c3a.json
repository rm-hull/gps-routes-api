  "description": "A splendid coastal walk from the little village of Hope Cove to Salcombe on the South West Coast Path. It's a lovely section of the path with visits to the headlands of Bolt Head and Bolt Tail. You'll also pass through the National Trust owned Bolberry Down with its pretty gorse, wildflowers and stunning views. The route is about 8 miles with come moderate climbs along the cliffs, so a reasonable level of fitness is required. You could turn it into a longer circular walk by following inland coutry lanes around Malborough. The walk starts on the sea front at Hope Cove and follows the path round to Bolt Tail. The headland is the site of an Iron Age promontory fort and commands fabulous views down the coast into Cornwall. The path continues east to Bolberry Down where there are some nice footpaths through some lovely coastal scenery and great views to Burgh Island and Bigbury on Sea. The next section takes you past the secluded beach at Soar Mill Cove to Bolt Head. This area is great for wildlife with Dartmoor Ponies grazing on the cliffs. You can also see coastal birds including Fulmar, Shag, and Cormorants. The path then descends from Bolt Head into Salcombe, passing the pretty beaches and Salcombe Castle. You also pass Tor Woods on your left, where you can sometimes see Sika Deer. To extend your walking in the area you can visit the beautiful Kingsbridge Estuary .",
