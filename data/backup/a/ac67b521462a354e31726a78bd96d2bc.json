Their plans are to turn the site into a working museum and already great strides have been made with track laid in the goods yard and head-shunt. A small steam engine (Annie) has been purchased from Chatham Dock-yard, and is used to give rides on the 1st Sunday of each month. Volunteers  help restore the buildings to their former glory."

  "description": "This wonderful cycle and walking path runs from Aylsham to Norwich along the trackbeds of two former railway lines. The route passes Cawston, Reepham , Lenwade, the wildlife rich Taverham Mill and Drayton, taking you through the Wensum Valley with regular views of the River Wensum to enjoy. Along the way look out for a series of rail sculptures and lots of interesting flora and fauna. Wildlife includes butterflies, jays, magpies, green woodpeckers and wrens. Cycle hire is available at Reepham station where there's also a nice cafe for refreshments. Near Reepham you will pass close to the Foxley Wood Nature Reserve. There's a number of nice walking trails to try here, with lots more wildlife and plantlife to see. At Lenwade the trail links up with the Wensum Way . The trail will take you west to Swanton Morley and Gressenhall on a pleasant flat path.",
