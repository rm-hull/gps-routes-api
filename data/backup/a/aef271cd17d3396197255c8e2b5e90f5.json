  "description": "A circular walk taking you along the River Dart before heading into the countryside surrounding the town of Totnes in Devon. The walk follows the Franklin Totnes Trail and the Dart Valley Trail footpaths before heading along Riverside Walk to visit the Longmarsh Nature Area on the eastern side of the water. The walk starts on the river in Totnes, near to the tourist information centre. Follow the riverside trail north before heading west into the countryside on Copland Lane. The path takes you towards Follaton House where there is an arboretum with a series of trails to try. After exploring Follaton Arboretum the walk heads along Jackman's Lane to Tristford Cross. This section climbs to nearly 500 feet with nice views across the attractive countryside. You then turn north east along Harper's Hill before heading south and east to rejoin the river. The trail returns to the start point before crossing the bridge for a delightful stroll along Riverside Walk. The path leads you to Longmarsh Nature Area where there's lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. It's easy to continue your waterside exercise in the Totnes area. You can pick up the Dart Valley Trail and follow it south all the way to Dartmouth. Just to the north you will find the wonderful Dartington Estate . Here you'll find miles of trails taking you along the river and through attractive woodland.",
