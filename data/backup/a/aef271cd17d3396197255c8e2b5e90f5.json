  "description": "A circular walk taking you along the River Dart before heading into the countryside surrounding the town of Totnes in Devon. The walk follows the Franklin Totnes Trail and the Dart Valley Trail footpaths before heading along Riverside Walk to visit the Longmarsh Nature Area on the eastern side of the water. The walk starts on the river in Totnes, near to the tourist information centre. Follow the riverside trail north before heading west into the countryside on Copland Lane. The path takes you towards Follaton House where there is an arboretum with a series of trails to try. After exploring Follaton Arboretum the walk heads along Jackman's Lane to Tristford Cross. This section climbs to nearly 500 feet with nice views across the attractive countryside. You then turn north east along Harper's Hill before heading south and east to rejoin the river. The trail returns to the start point before crossing the bridge for a delightful stroll along Riverside Walk. The path leads you to Longmarsh Nature Area where there's lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. It's easy to continue your waterside exercise in the Totnes area. You can pick up the Dart Valley Trail and follow it south all the way to Dartmouth. Just to the north you will find the wonderful Dartington Estate. Here you'll find miles of trails taking you along the river and through attractive woodland.",

      "content": "The delighful village of Stoke Gabriel is located just a few miles south east of the town. You can follow country lanes to the village where you'll find a pretty mill pond, a noteworthy old church and a splendid quay. It's a popular spot for tourists and well worth seeing if you are visiting the area. Just a few miles to the east there's Berry Pomeroy Castle to visit. Here you'll find the ruins of a 15th century castle surrounded by pleasant woodland trails. The site is run by English Heritage so there's good facilities with a car park, gift shop and cafe. The John Musgrave Heritage Trail can be picked up in this area too. The waymarked trail runs from Maidencombe to Brixham, visiting several of South Devon's interesting historical sites on the way. Continue south along the Dart Valley Trail and you will soon come to the delightful little hamlet of Tuckenhay. The settlement is very pretty with a picturesque old mill and waterside trails along the Bow Creek, one of the River Dart tributaries. There's also a splendid 18th century waterside pub which featured in The Times \u2018Best 50 Places to Eat Al Fresco\u2019. On the way you will pass the Sharpham Estate, a Grade I listed Palladian villa with parkland, gardens and woodland. The estate is now run as a mindfulness retreat but is open to the public on certain days. For more walking ideas in the area see the Devon Walks page."
