  "description": "Enjoy a walk through the beautiful 10 acre gardens surrounding the 18th century West Green House and then extend your walk into the adjacent West Green Common. Easy walking paths take you through a series of walled gardens including a topiary garden with water lillies and a Persian Water garden in a woodland glade. There is also a grand water staircase, a lake and an aviary with chickens and bantams. You can extend your walk by heading into West Green Common where you will find peaceful woodland trails. Just to the north you will find Bramshill Forest where you can continue your walking around the RSPB's Hazeley Heath. Dogmersfield Park can also be found a few miles to the south while the expansive Bracknell Forest is also nearby.",

There are good facilities here with bike hire and coaching available from the Look Out Centre. The Hartley Wintney Walk visits the pretty village to the east of the house before a stroll along the Basingstoke Canal. In nearby Hook there's some pleasant trails along the River Whitewater in the pretty Bassets Mead park on the eastern side of the town."
