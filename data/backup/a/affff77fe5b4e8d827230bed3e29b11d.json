You can reach the park from Southampton, Eastleigh or Winchester using National Cycle Route 23 which runs through the park. See the Southampton to Winchester Cycle Route. Just to the east of the park you can enjoy more cycling and walking trails in Itchen Valley Country Park. You can also pick up the Itchen Way here and enjoy a riverside walk towards Southampton or Winchester.",
