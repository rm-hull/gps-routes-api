  "description": "This circular walk visits the Big Water of Fleet Viaduct in Dumfries. The viaduct is located to the north of Gatehouse of Fleet on the Big Water Of Fleet. The river is a tributary of the Water of Fleet which flows into Fleet Bay on the Solway Firth. The viaduct is something of a local historical landmark having once been a part of the Portpatrick Railway route which closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts. It is 900-feet high with 20 arches and was built in the 19th century. You can park at the Cairnsmore of Fleet visitor centre car park to the south of the viaduct. Then follow a trail north east with fine views of the viaduct as you go. You can climb to the top and enjoy some fabulous views over the surrounding hills and countryside. The route then heads south west along the trackbed of the Portpatrick Railway, skirting the edge of a section of the Galloway Forest Park on the way. You can extend the walk by exploring the wild landscape of the Cairnsmore of Fleet National Nature Reserve. There's miles of trails here with fabulous scenery, sculpture trails and birds of prey to look out for.",

In nearby Glenluce you can pick up the Portpatrick Railway Walk along a section of the old Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Railway. The railway has an interesting history and there's also a visit to the impressive Luce Viaduct on the walk."
