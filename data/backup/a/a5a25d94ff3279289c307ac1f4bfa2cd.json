It was acquired by Lord Fairhaven and his brother, Henry Broughton, in 1926 and they brought it to its present condition. It came under the care of the National Trust in 1966 who describe the present buildings as \"One man's vision of English country living - an early 20th century luxury home lovingly created from the remnants of 800 years of change\"."

  "description": "Explore 114 acres of beautiful gardens surrounding this Jacobean mansion in Cambridge. You can stroll around the ornate statue garden with its mythological and biblical subjects before a peaceful walk down one of the tree lined avenues. There are plenty of wide open spaces with expansive lawns and pretty wildflower meadows - perfect for a summer picnic. There's also a waterside stroll along Quy Water and a visit to the working 18th century watermill where you can watch them grind wheat into flour, then buy some fresh from the chute. In the house you can view the 36 strong collection of clocks and the extensive works of art collected by Lord Fairhaven. The dining room is the only room surviving from the Augustinian priory that once stood on the site. Anglesey Abbey is located just a few miles east of Cambridge city centre.",
