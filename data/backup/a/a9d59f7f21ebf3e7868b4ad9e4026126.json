  "description": "This Edinburgh nature reserve offers a picturesque and peaceful walk through a wooded valley, following the course of the Braid Burn. The route provides an escape from the city, immersing visitors in nature and history. The area, a designated Local Nature Reserve, is teeming with wildlife and diverse plant life. The woodland is home to a variety of bird species, including great tits, robins, and woodpeckers. Look out for herons and ducks along the Braid Burn, while squirrels dart through the trees. During the spring and summer, wildflowers such as bluebells and wild garlic carpet the forest floor, adding a splash of colour and fragrance. The walk passes notable landmarks, including the 18th-century Hermitage House, once a hunting lodge, and the remnants of old mills powered by the burn. Trails wind through mature woodlands of beech, oak, and sycamore, with occasional open views of Blackford Hill and the surrounding area. To continue your walking you could climb to the aforementioned Blackford Hill which lies just to the north of the reserve.",
