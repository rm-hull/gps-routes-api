Ashwellthorpe station was opened by the GER (Great Eastern Railway), serving as a cut-off line between Forncett and Wymondham. It later became part of the London and North Eastern Railway. The station was closed to passenger traffic in 1939 and to freight in 1951. The originally single-track line was used for main line diversion trains during the floods of 1912 and it was doubled for military purposes during WWI. The two porters' cottages, the station master's house and the station building including a very short section of the former platform are still standing but have since been converted into private dwellings. An industrial site adjoins in the west."

The Priory became an Abbey in 1448 but was closed by Henry VIII in the 1530s; its remains can still be seen in the adjacent field. The archway seen here (at right) used to be one of the doorways into the church. The church was completed during the 12th century. It used to be a cruciform church, with a length of 70 metres and twin west towers."

  "description": "Follow Kett's Country Walk from Cringleford to Wymondham on this splendid walk through Norfolk. In 1549 Robert Kett led a movement which threatened the property owning classes. His journey from Wymondham to Norwich ended with the death of thousands of rebels in a pitched battle with 10,000 troops. This walk follows in his footsteps and visits a number of interesting villages with historic churches. While there is some lovely countryside scenery on the walk it is the fascinating historical aspects which are most appealing.To continue your walking you can enjoy stroll the lovely Tiffey Valley in Wymondham. A riverside path leads north from the town, with lots of wildlife and wildlfowers to look out for on the way.",
