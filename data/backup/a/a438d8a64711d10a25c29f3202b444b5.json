  "description": "This cycling and walking trail follows the route of the Old Shrewsbury Canal from the centre of Shrewsbury to Haughmond Hill at Uffington. The path starts at Castle Fields, just to the north east of the train station. It then heads through Ditherington and Heathgate before finishing at Uffington next to Haughmond Hill. It's a nice flat path running for about 3 miles with views of the River Severn. The route runs along part of the long distance Shropshire Way and runs alongside the Severn Way. The are both good options for extending your walk. You could also enjoy a climb to Haughmond Hill at the end of the route, where there are nice woodland trails and great views over Shropshire.",
