  "description": "This 18th century castle sits on a dramatic clifftop on the Ayrshire coast. It is surrounded by extensive grounds containing lush woodland, landscaped gardens and rugged coastline with numerous well maintained walking paths to follow. The Ayrshire Coastal Path passes the site so there is scope for continuing your walk. Follow the waymarked path north and you will soon come to the lovely Culzean Bay. Further on is Dunure, Bracken Bay and the Heads of Ayr. In Ayr itself you can pick up the River Ayr Walk which follows the whole length of the River Ayr from the coast to the source at Glenbuck Loch. Heading south will take you to the pretty Swan Pond and Maidenhead Bay.",
