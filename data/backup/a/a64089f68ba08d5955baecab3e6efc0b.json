  "description": "This route from Buxton uses the Midshires Way and the Pennine Bridleway to create a long circular walk around the town. The route runs for about 11 miles with a few moderate climbs along the way. From the high points there are lovely views of the surrounding Peak District scenery. The walk starts next to the train station in the town centre. From here you can pick up the Midshires Way and follow it south through Higher Buxton to the hospital. Here you turn east to follow the trail through Staden and Cowdale to Deep Dale. You then turn north east to follow the trails through Deep Dale, passing Far Hill Quarry on the way. The quarry has flooded and became known locally as 'The Blue Lagoon'. You continue east along the River Wye through Wye Dale to Chee Dale. Arouned here there was once a corn mill on the River Wye which may have dated from 1066. Most of it has disappeared, apart from the weir. What is left is marked as an Ancient Monument. At Chee Dale you pick up the Pennine Bridleway and follow it north toward Tunstead. The village is famous as the birthplace of James Brindley, pioneer builder of Britain's canals. He was born in 1716 in a farmhouse on the edge of the village and with the encouragement of his mother he became an apprentice millwright in Leek. The route heads west past the Great Rocks and Tunstead Works before picking up Green Lane. The lane will lead you back to the town where you finish at the train station. To extend the walk you could continue east along the Monsal Trail from Chee Dale to the lovely Miller's Dale. This popular beauty spot on the River Wye is one of the highlights of the area. There's shady wooded valleys, rushing rivers and lots of interesting flora and fauna to look out for around here. The climb to Chrome Hill is another good circular trail to try. It starts from Earl Sterndale near Buxton and gives great views over the Upper Dove valley. The Miller's Dale circular walk visits Tideswell Dale, Monk's Dale and the 18th century Litton Mill .",
