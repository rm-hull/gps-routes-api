  "description": "This walk visits the scenic Lough Salt in County Donegal near Milford. You can start the walk at the car parking area just to the north of the lake on Lough Salt Drive. Follow the road south and it will take you along the western side of the lough with fine views over the water to Loughsalt Mountain on the other side. It's a very peaceful area with sheep grazing on the pleasant green hills surrounding the lake. You can climb to the mountain on the eastern side for some tremendous views over the lake below. To continue your walking in the area you could head north to pick up the Donegal Boardwalk and enjoy a fine coastal walk along the lovely Sheephaven Bay.",
