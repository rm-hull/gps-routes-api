A group of 18th century merchants from Lancaster built Glasson Dock to import goods from the West Indies in 1746. Well-known cabinet makers Waring and Gillow started their business here by collecting mahogany dunnage used to protect cargoes arriving at Glasson, and using it to make furniture. The area includes businesses, residential settlements dating back to the early days of the Dock, with shops, seafaring public houses, and leisure craft marinas."

You can start the walk from the car park at the Conder Green picnic site. You can then pick up the Lune Estuary Footpath and follow it west towards Glasson Docks where there's a large marina. Here you can link with the canal and follow the towpath of the Glasson Branch east towards Lower Thurnham and Bailey Bridge.
