The cliffs of North Head, from Fleswick Bay northwards, have ledges eroded in the sandstone, which provide ideal nesting sites for Kittiwakes, visible only from the sea. In April or May, a sea kayak trip from St. Bees to Whitehaven gives an opportunity to see the cliff nests at very close quarters."

  "description": "Travel from the west coast of England to the east along this breathtaking route devised by Alfred Wainwright. The walk passes through three of England's most beautiful National Parks taking you on a tour of some of the most incredible scenery in the country. Starting at St Bees Head the route leads you into the wonderful Lake District National Park with its series of beautiful lakes and mountains. The path continues east into the Yorkshire Dales National Park with more delightful countryside to enjoy. The final stretch takes you through the splendid moorland scenery of the North York Moors National Park and then along the North Yorkshire coast to the finish point at the fishing village of Robin Hood's Bay.",
