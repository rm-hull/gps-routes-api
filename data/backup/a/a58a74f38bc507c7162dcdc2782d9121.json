  "description": "A circular walk from the village of Monyash visiting Youlgreave, Bradford Dale and the popular Lathkill Dale. The pretty village makes a good base for exploring the limestone scenery of the White Peak. There's a nice village green, pub, cafe and a notable Grade II listed church with Norman sections and a 15th century font. From the car park in the village you can pick up the Limestone Way long distance footpath. The trail runs south east, passing Fern Dale and Cales Dale before coming to Bradford Dale. Here you can follow nice riverside trails along the River Bradford into Youlgreave. In the village there are a number of good pubs where you could stop for refreshments at what is roughly the half way point on the walk. The route leaves the village, heading north east to the River Lathkill near Alport. Follow the river north, crossing the bridge at Conksbury before entering Lathkill Dale. The dale is a peaceful, atmospheric area flanked with large limestone cliffs and woodland. There's also waterfalls and weirs and a wide variety of flora and fauna to look out for. The path through the dale will lead you past Over Haddon to Bagshaw Dale before returning to Monyash. To continue your walking in the area you could head a couple of miles south of the village and visit Arbor Low. The Neolothic limestone circle sits in an elevated position with great views over the surrounding moors of the White Peak.",
