  "description": "This local nature reserve is located in the Corfe Mullen /Broadstone/Creekmoor area of Poole in Dorset. There's a network of footpaths including a bridleway along the trackbed of the old Southampton to Dorchester Railway in the southern part of the reserve. The site includes woodland, heathland, sandy paths, gorse and tranquil lakes with lots of wildlife to see as well. Look out for Dartford Warbler, Nightjar and Stonechat as you make your way across the heath. There are also fine views towards Poole Harbour and Corfe Castle from the high points. You can start the walk from the parking area off Springdale Road at the northern end of the reserve. Then follow footpaths south to the viewpoint, Beacon Hills Clay Pits, lakes and the dismantled railway at the southern end.",
