  "description": "This walk takes you around the remote Loch Avon in Glen Avon. Also known as Loch A'an it is the source of the River Avon, a tributary of the River Spey. There's decent walking trails along the stunning loch with wonderful views over the water to the surrounding mountains. The loch is located just south of Cairn Gorm and north of Ben Macdui in the Cairngorms National Park. You can extend the walk by heading south to visit the smaller Loch Etchachan, a popular place with wild swimmers and wild campers.",
