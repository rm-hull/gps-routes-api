  "description": "This popular town sits on the Firth of Clyde, in Argyll and Bute, near Loch Lomond. The town is located on the edge of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park where there are numerous lochside paths and wonderful hill climbs to enjoy. There's also long distance trails such as the Three Lochs Way and the West Highland Way running through the area. This figure of eight walk explores the surrounding area using sections of the Three Lochs Way and John Muir Way long distance footpaths. On the eastern section you'll climb to the forestry around Ben Bowie and visit Craigendoran. On the western loop there's a climb to Highlandman's Wood and the lovely Glenarn Gardens where there's some beautiful specimens to admire. From the high points there are some wonderful views over Gare Loch and the Firth of Clyde to the surrounding hills and mountains. For more information on the history, climate, local attractions and transport links see the informative wikipedia page.",
