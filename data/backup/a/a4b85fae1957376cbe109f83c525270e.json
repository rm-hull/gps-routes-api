  "description": "Follow the coast path from Weymouth to one of the geological highlights of the Jurassic Coast on this Dorset walk. It's about a 10 mile hike from the town to the picturesque stone arch using an undulating section of the long distance, waymarked footpath. On the way you'll pass Lodmoor Country Park near Weymouth. The park is also a designated nature reserve with an easy access walking path taking you through various habitats including reedbed, open water, saltmarsh and wet grassland. You'll also pass the Osmington White Horse near the village of Osmington. The village includes a church dating from the 12th century and picturesque thatched dwellings dating back to the 16th century. The final section will take you past the attractive Ringstead Bay before coming to Durdle Door. The spectacular natural limestone arch also has an adjacent beach and caves. You can follow a path down to the beach and enjoy a rest and refreshments before the return leg. To extend the walk you can continue along the path a short distance to Lulworth Cove. This sheltered bay is enclosed almost in a circle and was formed 10,000 years ago by the combined forces of a river and the sea. Next to the cove you will pass the West Lulworth Heritage Centre which contains a museum about the coast and the village.",

Situated on the cliff tops of the South West Coast Path, just outside the village of Osmington, the Smugglers Inn is a traditional English pub with stunning views overlooking the Isle of Portland. The pub also has an interesting history having been the headquarters of the French smuggler Pierre Latour and one of the main landing places for smuggled goods in the 17th century. Notably the Inn was originally built in the 13th century, with its own brewery at the rear. There's a lovely large garden area which is perfect for relaxing in when the weather is fine. You can fine the pub right on the coast at a postcode of DT3 6HF for your sat navs."
