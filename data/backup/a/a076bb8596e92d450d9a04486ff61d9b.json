  "description": "This walk explores the Elveden Estate in the West Suffolk village of Elveden. The historic estate surrounds Elveden Hall, a large stately home dating mainly from the Georgian period. From the village you can follow a track south across the estate with nice views of the surrounding countryside. The Icknield Way Path runs across the estate. You could pick this up and follow it east to explore Berner's Heath. The Duke's Ride is a track that can also be used for cycling which runs to the heath. If you follow the Icknield Way north east you can visit Thetford Heath and the town of Thetford where there are some lovely riverside walks. You can also explore the expansive Thetford Forest in this area.",
