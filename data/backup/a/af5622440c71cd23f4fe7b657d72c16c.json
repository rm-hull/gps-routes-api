  "description": "Enjoy miles of cycling and walking trails in this lovely forest near Portsmouth. The site is a delightful mixture of woodland, open space, heathland, farmland, downland, streams and ponds. The forest includes Creech Woods with its conifers, heather and play areas for children. The circular route below starts at the Creech Woods car park and takes you around the forest on wide grassy paths. A couple of miles west of Creech Woods you can visit the West Walk area of the forest. There's more nice waymarked trails to try here. Just to the east you will find Havant Thicket where you can visit the ponds and look out for deer. If you'd like to continue exploring this area then you could head a few miles west to Wickham where you can pick up the super Meon Valley Trail. This cycling and walking trail runs along a disused railway track from West Meon to Meonstoke and Wickham, with great views of the River Meon.",

This uses sections of the Wayfarer's Walk and the King's Way to visit the woods before heading through the countryside to the village of Hambledon.
