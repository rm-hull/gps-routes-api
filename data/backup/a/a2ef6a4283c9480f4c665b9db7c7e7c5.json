  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful walk around the delightful grounds and deer park surrounding this 16th century house in Padstow, on the Cornish coast. In the grounds you will find an 80 tree lime avenue, a Victorian Formal Garden and pretty woodland paths. In the deer park you can see one of the oldest park herds in the country. From the tea room you can watch them being fed with views across the Camel Estuary. Prideaux Place is an Elizabethan manor house still lived in by the Prideaux family. You can tour the house and see exquisite Italian paintings, family portraits, photographs, porcelain and antiques. The house is located just a few hundred metres from the Camel Estuary at Padstow, so you could continue your walk along the Camel Trail or the Saints Way which both run past the park. Heading north from Padstow will take you to the lovely Stepper Point and Daymark Tower. This coastal headland has great views of Padstow Bay and lots of interesting rock formations. You can follow the coastal path round to Trevone Bay where there is a nice beach and cafe.",
