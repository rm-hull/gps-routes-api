  "description": "This Kent based village has some nice walking trails through the valley of the River Teise and two noteworthy historic ruins to visit nearby. There's also a fine 15th century pub to relax in after your exercise. This walk takes you west from the village to visit Furnace Mill and the ruined Bayham Abbey. The walk starts in the village and follows footpaths west along the River Teise to Furnace Mill. The picturesque mill sits next to the river in a lovely spot. It was once a working watermill but is now a private residence. The route continues west past Floshet Wood before turning south towards Hook Green. You can then follow an access road north to reach Bayham Old Abbey. The site is run by English Heritage and includes substantial ruins. There's a 13th to 15th-century church, the chapter house, and a picturesque 14th-century gatehouse to see in this historic area.",
