  "description": "A short circular walk around St Paul's Cray in Bromley. The route takes you through Pauls Cray Hill Park, past Cray Valley Golf Club and through Park Wood where you will pass the Scadbury Park Nature Reserve. Good access points are the parking lot at Park Wood or St Mary Cray Station. This is quite an easy walk with the main highlight the section through Scadbury Park. With 300 acres of ancient woodland and the ruins of the Elizabethan Moated Manor House it is well worth exploring. Just to the east of St Pauls Cray the route also crosses the Cray Riverway. This pleasant waterside walk will take you south along the River Cray to the source at Orpington or north to Erith where it meets the River Darent and the Thames.",
