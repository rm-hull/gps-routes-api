On the way it visits two other fine country parks in the area - Moors Valley Country Park and Upton Country Park. Also nearby is the expansive Hurn Forest where there's miles of woodland trails to try. Just to the north you'll find the town of Verwood. Here you can enjoy a walk around Verwood Forest, the Cranborne Common Nature Reserve and the Stephen's Castle Nature Reserve where there's a lovely viewpoint."
