  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the town of Pwllheli on the Llyn Peninsula. On the walk you'll visit the harbour, beach, the River Rhydir and the Lon Cob Bach Nature Reserve. Pwllheli is considered the the main town of the peninsula, with a train station and a range of shops and other services. The walk starts from the train station and heads south to the front where there are two blue flag beaches. You then head west along the beach before following a footpath north to the River Rhydir and the Lon Cob Bach Nature Reserve. There's some nice walkways here with interesting flora and fauna to look out for. You continue east through the town to the Inner Harbour where there's a nice path to follow to South Beach. You then retrace your steps to return to the train station and the finish point of the walk. To continue your walking in the area pick up the Llyn Coastal Path which runs through the town. Heading east will take you to Criccieth with its historic castle and the grave of former Prime Minister David Lloyd George in neighbouring Llanystumdwy. Heading west will take you to the beautiful National Trust beach at Llanbedrog before coming to Abersoch where you can visit the southernmost point of the peninsula at Cilan Head.",
