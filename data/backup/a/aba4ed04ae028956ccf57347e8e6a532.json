  "description": "Top Lodge in Fineshade Woods has several waymarked cycling and walking trails. For cyclists there is a green graded easy route running through the main woodland block. It is a gentle ride perfect for families on largely flat paths. Running alongside the green route are 7 alternative blue grade sections. These are great for mountain bikers looking for more of a challenge. Walkers can enjoy three colour coded, waymarked trails of varying difficulty. The Smelters' Walk is an easy trail for abilities. It runs for 2 miles on flat well surfaced paths. The moderate Dales Wood Trail visits the Wildlife Hide where can you look out for birds on the feeders and deer in the woodland. There is also a short climb to a viewpoint with great views over Rockingham Forest. For a more challenging walk you can try the Mill Wood Trail which involves a few harder climbs. Along the way you can look out for lots of wildlife including red kite, nightingale, nightjar, woodcock, grasshopper warbler, tree pipit, marsh and willow tits. If you would like to continue your walk you can pick up the Jurassic Way which runs through the wider area of the ancient Rockingham Forest. Or head to the nearby Wakerley Woods which is just a couple of miles to the west. Here you'll find pleasant walking trails and a blue grade, single-track mountain bike trail. Fineshade Woods is located close to Peterborough, Corby, Stamford and Oakham.",
