  "description": "Top Lodge in Fineshade Woods has several waymarked cycling and walking trails. For cyclists there is a green graded easy route running through the main woodland block. It is a gentle ride perfect for families on largely flat paths. Running alongside the green route are 7 alternative blue grade sections. These are great for mountain bikers looking for more of a challenge. Walkers can enjoy three colour coded, waymarked trails of varying difficulty. The Smelters' Walk is an easy trail for abilities. It runs for 2 miles on flat well surfaced paths. The moderate Dales Wood Trail visits the Wildlife Hide where can you look out for birds on the feeders and deer in the woodland. There is also a short climb to a viewpoint with great views over Rockingham Forest. For a more challenging walk you can try the Mill Wood Trail which involves a few harder climbs. Along the way you can look out for lots of wildlife including red kite, nightingale, nightjar, woodcock, grasshopper warbler, tree pipit, marsh and willow tits. If you would like to continue your walk you can pick up the Jurassic Way which runs through the wider area of the ancient Rockingham Forest. Or head to the nearby Wakerley Woods which is just a couple of miles to the west. Here you'll find pleasant walking trails and a blue grade, single-track mountain bike trail. Fineshade Woods is located close to Peterborough, Corby, Stamford and Oakham.",

The pub dates back to 1732 and includes a charming old interior with oak beams and inglenook fireplaces. They serve a fine Sunday roast and also provide rooms if you'd like to stay over. You can find them on West Street at postcode PE8 6XA for your sat navs."

      "content": "Follow the Jurassic Way west and it will take you to the noteworthy Harringworth Welland Viaduct. The Grade II listed viaduct is about a kilometre long, and was completed in 1878. It contains 82 arches and is notable as the longest masonry viaduct across a valley in Britain. Just to the east you'll find the pretty village of King's Cliffe where you can pick up the Kings Cliffe Railway Walk. The easy trail runs along a now disused railway line to the east of the village. King's Cliffe is also a pleasant place for a stroll with a Norman church, picturesque 17th century almshouses and nice views of the Willow Brook, a tributary of the River Nene. There's also a fine old 18th century pub for refreshments afterwards. Near here there's also Blatherwycke Lake to explore. There's some lovely waterside trails with lots of birdlife to see on the water at this scenic spot."
