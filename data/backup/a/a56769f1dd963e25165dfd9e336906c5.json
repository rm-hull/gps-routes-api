  "description": "This section of the Neath Canal makes for a lovely waterside cycle or walk. It runs along the National Cycle Network route from the parking area at Craig Nedd, Resolven to Glynneath. You'll pass pretty locks and bridges with views of the River Neath along the way. St Illtyd's Walk runs through Resolven so you could pick this up and head to the nearby Melincourt Falls to extend your walk. At the western end of the route you can pick up the Tennant Canal and follow it west towards Swansea. This area also includes the lovely Aberdulais Falls, a popular beauty spot with rushing waterfalls and a woodland park.",
