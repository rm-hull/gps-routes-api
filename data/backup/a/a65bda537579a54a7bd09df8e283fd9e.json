The woods are run by the National Trust and include 12 acres (5 hectares) of semi-natural ancient woodland. You can start the walk from the little village of Bulkeley, following public footpaths to Bulkeley Woods and the Sandstone Trail to the hill top viewpoint. From here there are splendid views over the Cheshire Plain. You can further explore the area by trying the Peckforton Castle and Peckforton Hills Walk which runs past the site. You could also head west along the Sandstone Trail and visit Bickerton Hill and Maiden Castle .",
