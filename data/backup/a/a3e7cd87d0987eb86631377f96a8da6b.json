  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Cotter Force waterfall near Appersett in the Yorkshire Dales. The walk starts at the roadside parking area next to Holme Heads Bridge and follows a good footpath along the Cotterdale Beck to the falls. The falls are very pretty, comprising of six steps, each with its own small waterfall. The area is good for birdwatching too. Look out for dippers, grey wagtails, kingfishers and redstarts as you make your way along the trail. There are plenty of good options for continuing your walking in this lovely area. You could visit the nearby Hardraw Force waterfall or climb Great Shunner Fell. The Hawes Circular Walk takes you on a tour of the rivers, becks, waterfalls and hills surrounding the town.",

      "content": "The River Ure runs just to the south of the beck. You could pick up another footpath heading west to more waterfalls at Mossdale Gill. See the Appersett Viaduct and the River Ure Walk for more details. The circular Garsdale Walk starts from the nearby Garsdale train station on the Settle and Carlisle Line. It's a beautiful area with trails along the Grisedale Beck and more pretty waterfalls to see. Near here there's also the noteworthy Uldale Force. This impressive waterfall is located in a striking limestone gorge on the River Rawthey. There's also a series of smaller waterfalls so the area is well worth a visit especially after rainfall. For more walking ideas in the area see the Yorkshire Dales Walks page."
