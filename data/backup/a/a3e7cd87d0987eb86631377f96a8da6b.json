  "description": "This walk visits the lovely Cotter Force waterfall near Appersett in the Yorkshire Dales. The walk starts at the roadside parking area next to Holme Heads Bridge and follows a good footpath along the Cotterdale Beck to the falls. The falls are very pretty, comprising of six steps, each with its own small waterfall. The area is good for birdwatching too. Look out for dippers, grey wagtails, kingfishers and redstarts as you make your way along the trail. There are plenty of good options for continuing your walking in this lovely area. You could visit the nearby Hardraw Force waterfall or climb Great Shunner Fell. The Hawes Circular Walk takes you on a tour of the rivers, becks, waterfalls and hills surrounding the town.",
