On the left is Redbridge Causeway, with its blue railings and tall street lamps, which carries the A35 across the river. The tower block in the centre is the aptly-named Redbridge Tower and the one on the far left is Millbrook Tower (which is a strange name choices as it is not in Millbrook)."

  "description": "This Hampshire based town is located near Southampton and the New Forest National Park. It's a nice place to start a walk with riverside paths and two local nature reserves to explore. This walk starts from the train station and visits the Lower Test Nature Reserve and Testwood Lakes. Part of the walk uses a section of the Test Way, a long distance trail following the route of the River Test. The area has some pleasant waterside trails, marshland, boardwalks, bird hides and a wide variety of wildlife to look out for. If you follow the Test Way south from the train station it will take you to the start of the walk at Eling Tide Mill. The Grade II listed mill is a major local attraction with picturesque walks and some fascinating local history. To continue your walking around the town head east into Southampton where you can explore Southampton Common and pick up the historical Southampton Walls Walk. To the west is the village of Ashurst where you can pick up a variety of walks around the New Forest .",
