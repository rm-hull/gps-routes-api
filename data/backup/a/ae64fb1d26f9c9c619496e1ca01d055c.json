This is the original wharf (off to the right) on the Kennet navigation, now the Kennet and Avon canal, that served the village of Aldermaston, two miles to the south. Thus a small community grew up here in its own right. The lock was originally a turf-sided lock, like all of them on the Kennet navigation between Reading and Newbury. It was rebuilt in 1984 during the restoration of the canal. The flats have been built during the last few years on the site of the former Sterling Cables works. Various canoeists are seen practising for the Devizes to Westminster canoe race, that takes place over the Easter weekend. The swans ignore all the activity and go about their business."

The old bridge was removed during July 1990 and boats first allowed through on 17th July 1990, the first for over 40 years."

  "description": "This Berkshire based village has some nice river and canalside trails to try. This walk from the village takes you up to Aldermaston Wharf on the Kennet and Avon Canal . You then follow the towpath west to visit the neighbouring village of Woolhampton. The walk starts in the village and then follows the Fisherman's Lane track north east to Padworth Mill where you cross the River Kennet. You head north here, passing the flooded gravel pits before arriving at Aldermaston Wharf. The wharf is a significant spot on the canal with a British Waterways visitor centre to explore. It includes a tea room and is located at the canal east of the lift bridge. Here you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it west to Woolhampton where there's a pretty lock, bridge and train station.",
