  "description": "A walk around the delightful Hanbury Hall Park in Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire. The 18th century hall is surrounded by beautiful gardens and parkland. There's also an orangery and a walled orchard containing a wide range of traditional English fruit varieties. The park is run by the National Trust so for a fee you can gain access to more walks around the hall. This route takes you through the delightful gardens and then into the countryside park where you will cross the Worcester and Birmingham Canal .",

    {
      "subtitle": "Further Information and Other Local Ideas",
      "content": "The park is also located very close to the Droitwich Canal which allows more easy walking along the towpath. Our longer Hanbury Circular Walk visits the canals and the park with a climb to Hanbury Hill Church where you'll find the St Mary the Virgin church which dates from 1200. The church grounds includes a viewpoint with a toposcope displaying all the sites you can see from the elevated position. Just to the west of Droitwich is the worthy village of Ombersley where you'll find a number of interesting timber framed properties, an ancient 15th century pub and the historic Ombersley House Estate. For more walking ideas in the area see the Worcestershire Walks page."
