  "description": "This National Trust owned site is located in the village of Farnborough in rural Warwickshire. The Grade I listed hall dates from the 18th century and is surrounded by attractive parkland with lakes and beautiful landscaped gardens. This circular walk from the hall explores the countryside to the north of the site. You'll pass Avon Dassett, Shooter's Hill, Hall's Hill and Windmill Hill before passing through Farnborough village. On the way there's some nice country views from the high points and lots of wildlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for Kingfisher, moorhens, long tailed tits, gold crests, and tree creepers. The D'arcy Dalton Way passes the hall on the eastern side. This waymarked long distance trail starts off just to the north at Wormleighton Reservoir and heads south through the Cotswolds towards Ashbury. It's a good way of further stretching your legs if you have time.",

      "content": "Head west and you can visit the neighbouring village of Avon Dassett. Here you can pick up the Warwickshire Centenary Way and follow the waymarked footpath north to the splendid Burton Dassett Hills Country Park. A few miles to the west there are some nice woodland trails on Edge Hill. Here you'll find some fine views and the site of the Battle of Edgehill, the first battle of the English Civil War fought in 1642. The area includes an excellent, elevated pub where you can enjoy views over the battlefield. Near here is the worthy village of Tysoe where you could enjoy a climb to the Tysoe Windmill. The photogenic old mill sits on top of a 184 metre hill with excellent views over the Cotswolds. Just to the east you could enjoy some waterside walking along the Oxford Canal Walk or around the pretty Clattercote Reservoir. For more walking ideas in the area see the Warwickshire Walks and the Cotswolds Walks pages."
