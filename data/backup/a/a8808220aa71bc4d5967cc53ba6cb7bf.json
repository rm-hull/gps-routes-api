  "description": "This National Trust owned site is located in the village of Farnborough\u00a0in rural Warwickshire. The Grade I listed hall dates from the 18th century and is surrounded by attractive parkland with lakes and beautiful landscaped gardens. This circular walk from the hall explores the countryside to the north of the site. You'll pass Avon Dassett , Shooter's Hill, Hall's Hill and Windmill Hill before passing through Farnborough village. On the way there's some nice country views from the high points and lots of wildlife to see. Keep your eyes peeled for Kingfisher, moorhens, long tailed tits, gold crests, and tree creepers. The D'arcy Dalton Way passes the hall on the eastern side. This waymarked long distance trail starts off just to the north at Wormleighton Reservoir and heads south through the Cotswolds towards Ashbury . It's a good way of further stretching your legs if you have time.",
