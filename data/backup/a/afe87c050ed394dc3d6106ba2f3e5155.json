  "description": "Enjoy wonderful views over the Longleat Estate and the surrounding Wiltshire countryside on this short walk near Warminster . From the car park at the Nockatt Coppice there is a lovely footpath through attractive woodland which leads to the top of Prospect Hill and Heaven's gate. Here you will find a series of interesting stone sculptures created by the sculptor Paul Norris. In the right light the crystals and metals embedded within the stones are reflected meaning the stones appear to glow. From the top of Prospect hill you can also enjoy far reaching views towards Somerset. There's a series of benches where can you sit and relax or wide lawns where you could have a picnic. To extend your walk you could head east through the woodland to Shearwater Lake . This 37 acre lake is surrounded by attractive woodland and interesting flora and fauna. You could also climb the nearby Cley Hill for more great views over West Wiltshire and Somerset.",
