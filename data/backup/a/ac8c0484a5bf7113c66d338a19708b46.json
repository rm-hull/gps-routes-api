  "description": "Visit this 19th-century Gothic Revival in Tongwynlais and enjoy a walk or cycle in the adjacent Fforest Fawr. The route starts in Tongwynlais taking you around the castle and then into the peaceful woodland of Fforest Fawr which lies just to the east. The castle is located next to the Taff Trail so you could extend your cycle/walk by heading along the River Taff. The castle itself is very photogenic, often described as a fairytale castle. There are good facilities with a car park, gift shop and an audio tour where you can learn all about the history of the castle. If you feel like stretching your legs further you could head just a mile to the west and try the more challenging climb to Garth Hill from Taff's Well. The noteworthy hill is thought to be the inspiration for the fictional hill featured in the film 'The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain' starring Hugh Grant. There's some splendid views over the area from the hill summit.",
