  "description": "Claife Heights lies between Lake Windermere and Esthwaite Water in the Lake District. It's a splendid area for a walk with peaceful woodland, a number of tranquil tarns and wonderful views over the surrounding lakes. It's a special place as it has a distinctive feel to the rest of the lake district. It was also a place visited regularly by Beatrix Potter who lived at the nearby Hill Top. This circular walk starts at the ferry landing on the western shore of Windermere. You can catch the ferry from Bowness on Windermere. The route then heads to Far Sawrey before climbing through woodland to High Blind How, the high point on Claife Heights at 270 m (890 ft). The walk then passes a series of delightful tarns including Wise Een Tarn and Moss Eccles tarn. Beatrix Potter owned Moss Eccles and donated it to the National Trust after her death. The tarn is stocked with water lilies and fish, and surrounded by pretty rhododendrons. It's a particularly tranquil spot and one you'll want to stop at for a while. From the tarn the walk then descends on a good path to Far Sawrey and then on to the ferry. An alternative route takes you to the National Trust view point of Claife Station along the western shore of Windermere. See the video below for details of this. If you'd like to continue your walking in this area then you could visit the nearby Wray Castle or climb to Latterbarrow Hill .",
