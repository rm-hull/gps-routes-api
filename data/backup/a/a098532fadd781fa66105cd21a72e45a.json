There's lots of tables outside where you can enjoy a meal with great views of the trees. It's a lovely spot to take the weight of your feet. They serve a wide range of tasty hot and cold locally sourced food (including daily specials), delicious cakes and freshly baked pastries, as well as a range of hot and cold Fairtrade drinks. Just to the north of the cafe there's a bookable BBQ area if you fancy bringing along your own food to cook. Just email wendoverbbq@forestryengland.uk for more info."
