  "description": "These pretty woods near York have some lovely peaceful walking trails to try. You can start your walk from the car park at the end of Broad Highway at a postcode of YO19 6BG for your sat navs. From here you can pick up the trails heading west into the woods. On your walk look out for wildlife including woodland birds and deer. It's a quiet, out of the way sort of place, especially during the week.",
