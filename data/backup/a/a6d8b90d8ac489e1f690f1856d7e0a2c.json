  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the popular market town of Olney near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. Along the way there's a riverside stretch along the River Great Ouse, nice countryside views and a visit to the pretty lakes in Emberton Country Park. The walk starts in the town centre and heads east across the sports ground to meet with the river. Follow the riverside footpath south and you cross the water before turning south west to visit Emberton Park. It's a lovely spot with 5 lakes, wooded glades and meadows. The park is a good place for bird watching with a number of water loving species regularly visiting the lakes. After exploring the park follow the same countrt footpaths back to the river. You'll pass the ford before turning north and heading back through the town centre.",

The circular path could be followed west to visit the expansive Salcey Forest where there are miles of woodland cycling and walking trails. The Three Shires Way runs just to the east of the town. This shared cycling and walking trail can be picked up in nearby Clifton Reynes. You could follow it south toward Milton Keynes or north towards Bozeat. On the eastern side of Milton Keynes there's Newport Pagnell to explore. There's some lovely riverside trails, a fine local park and several historic buildings to see in this nearby town. The town is well known for being the original home of the exclusive sports car manufacturer Aston Martin. There's also a Grade I listed iron bridge dating from the early 19th century to see here."
