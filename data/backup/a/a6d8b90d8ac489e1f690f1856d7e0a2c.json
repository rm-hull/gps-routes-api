  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the popular market town of Olney near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. Along the way there's a riverside stretch along the River Great Ouse, nice countryside views and a visit to the pretty lakes in Emberton Country Park . The walk starts in the town centre and heads east across the sports ground to meet with the river. Follow the riverside footpath south and you cross the water before turning south west to visit Emberton Park. It's a lovely spot with 5 lakes, wooded glades and meadows. The park is a good place for bird watching with a number of water loving species regularly visiting the lakes. After exploring the park follow the same countrt footpaths back to the river. You'll pass the ford before turning north and heading back through the town centre.",
