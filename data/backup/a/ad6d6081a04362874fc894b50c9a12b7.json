It was ransacked and taken over as headquarters by the French invaders who landed on the coast below in February 1797, intending to spearhead a revolutionary force to bring down the British government. The expedition was a fiasco from the start.It may have been that a disaffected exservant from this farm who was among the rabble army led them to Trehowel. The farmer, John Mortimer, was about to be married and had laid in plentiful stocks of food and drink which detained the starving marauders and may have blunted their appetite for fighting. Rapidly mustered local troops forced them to surrender on Goodwick beach a few days later."
