  "description": "This walk climbs to Killiney Hill where you can enjoy wonderful views over the surrounding area. From the 153 metre high point you can see Dublin to the northwest, the Irish Sea and the mountains of Wales, the Wicklow Mountains and Bray Head. You can start the walk from the Killiney Hill car park, just to the north of the hill. From here you can pick up a circular trail running up to the wonderful viewpoint. Here you will find an obelisk which bears the inscription: 'Last year being hard with the poor, walks about these hills and this were erected by John Mapas, June 1742.' There was originally a railway station located between Dalkey and Killiney on this scenic section of the Dublin\u2013Rosslare railway line known as Obelisk Hill. To continue your walking in the area head to the nearby Dalkey Hill where there are more fine views to enjoy. There's also some fine coastal walking to try at the Howth Cliff Walk, the Donabate to Portrane Cliff Walk or the Malahide to Portmarnock Coastal Walk. For a more challenging walk around the Howth peninsula try the Purple Route (Bog of Frogs) which climbs to the hills above the coast. From here there's wonderful views over Portmarnock, Sutton, Bull Island and most of Dublin Bay. You could also head into Dublin and visit Tymon Park. There's a number of nice waymarked woodland trails and waterside paths along the River Poddle here.",

It's a popular coastal walk taking you along the 19th century pier with splendid sea views and an additional visit to the delightful People's Park. To the south you can pick up the epic Dublin Mountains Way in Shankill. The popular waymarked trail takes you west into the stunning scenery of the Wicklow Mountains."
