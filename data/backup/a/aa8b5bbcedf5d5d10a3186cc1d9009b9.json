The classic features included a lawn sweeping up to the house, clumps of trees, a serpentine lake and an encircling tree belt and carriage drive, also showing a serpentine geometry. This is the style of what is often known as the 'English landscape garden', or possibly even the 'Brownian' style."

The leasehold passed through marriage to the North family who lived here until 1932. Lord North (1732-1792), best known as the Prime Minister who lost Britain's American colonies, was born here. Today is owned by the Fairleigh Dickinson University from New Jersey in the USA (interesting touch of irony given previous owners!) and now known as Wroxton College and is featured in their \"Study Abroad\" programme."

  "description": "This walk explores the Oxfordshire village of Wroxton and the splendid grounds of a fine Jacobean mansion. The walk starts off in the pretty village where there's a pond and lots of old Cotswolds cottages to admire. You can then follow a public footpath through the college and abbey grounds to the nearby obelisk. Continue north west and you will soon come to the neighbouring village of Drayton. It's a beautiful area with a serepentine lake, lawns, woodlands, a cascade and a number of follies. The house itself also has a fascinating history having been built in the 17th-century on the foundations of a 13th-century Augustinian priory. It is also notable as the former residence of Lord North, who was the Prime Minister during the American War of Independence.",
