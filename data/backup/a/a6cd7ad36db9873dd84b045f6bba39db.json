In fact, the walk across Rhinog Fach and y Llethr is strenuous but easy to follow as clear paths can be followed along the ridge. The heathery coating of mountain makes progress a lot slower once the path is lost, which is almost unavoidable in places."

  "description": "Visit the Rhinogs range of mountains in the Snowdonia National Park and climb Rhinog Fawr on this challenging walk. You'll pass heathery\u00a0slopes, little streams, rocky outcrops and two small lakes on your way to the top. The walk begins from the Llyn Cwm Bychan car park a couple of miles north of Rhinog Fawr. You then follow the footpaths through a woodland area before climbing the Roman Steps. You'll pass the two pretty lakes of Llyn Morwynion and Llyn Du before coming to the 720\u00a0m (2,360\u00a0ft) summit of Rhinog Fawr. From here there are fabulous views over the surrounding peaks and lakes. The area is also a National Nature Reserve so look out for interesting flora and fauna including purple heather and wild goats.",
