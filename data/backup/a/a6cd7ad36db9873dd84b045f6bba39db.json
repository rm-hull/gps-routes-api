The heathery coating of mountain makes progress a lot slower once the path is lost, which is almost unavoidable in places."

  "description": "Visit the Rhinogs range of mountains in the Snowdonia National Park and climb Rhinog Fawr on this challenging walk. You'll pass heathery slopes, little streams, rocky outcrops and two small lakes on your way to the top. The walk begins from the Llyn Cwm Bychan car park a couple of miles north of Rhinog Fawr. You then follow the footpaths through a woodland area before climbing the Roman Steps. You'll pass the two pretty lakes of Llyn Morwynion and Llyn Du before coming to the 720 m (2,360 ft) summit of Rhinog Fawr. From here there are fabulous views over the surrounding peaks and lakes. The area is also a National Nature Reserve so look out for interesting flora and fauna including purple heather and wild goats.",

      "content": "Head to the coast and you could pick up the Harlech Walk. This visits the village of Llanbedr, the River Artro Estuary and the Morfa Dyffryn Nature Reserve. The beautiful reserve includes huge sand dunes, seashore, saltmarsh and grassland with a wide variety of wildlife to look out for. Near Llanbedr village there's also something of a hidden gem at the wonderful Nantcol Waterfalls. The area includes pleasant trails along the River Cwmnantcol with a series of rushing waterfalls to see along the way. There's also a circular walk around a small reservoir, just west of the falls. Just to the south of Llanbedr there's the village of Dyffryn Ardudwy where there's a train station for public transport access. There's also the fascinating Dyffryn Ardudwy Burial chamber to explore in the village. The ancient site includes a hut circle and a number of dolmen dating back over 6000 thousand years.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Snowdonia Walks page."
