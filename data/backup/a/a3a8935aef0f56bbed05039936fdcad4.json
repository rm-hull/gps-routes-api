  "description": "Enjoy a waterside walk along the Louth Canal from Louth to Tetney Marshes. Along the way there's the lovely scenery of the Lincolnshire Wolds countryside and nice views of the River Lud. You can walk the length of the canal along the towpath which runs for about 12 miles. The walk starts from the interesting market town of Louth in the Lincolnshire Wolds. It's a very pretty town with Georgian streets including several fine buildings such as Louth Manor House and many others dating from 17th century onwards. Other highlights include St. James church where you can climb the tower for nice views over the town. You should also visit the interesting Louth Museum, the Greenwich meridian line plaque and the delightful Hubbard's Hills park. You can pick up the canal towpath on the eastern side of the town and follow it north east towards Keddington and Alvingham. On your right hand side around Keddington you can take a short detour to visit the remains of Louth Abbey which dates from 1139. At High Bridge the canal turns towards the North West, passing Conisholme Fen and Covenham Reservoir. The final sections takes you over Thoresby Bridge before passing Tetney Lock and finishing at Tetney Marshes Nature Reserve on the Humber Estuary. The RSPB reserve makes a lovely end to the walk. It's situated on the north Lincolnshire coast and includes coastal mudflats, salt marsh, dunes and saline lagoons. The reserve is a fantastic place for bird watching with brent geese, knots, golden plovers, redshanks and sanderlings to look out for. The Silver Lincs Way long distance trail also starts in Louth and runs all the way to Grimsby. You could pick this up and follow it to the delightful Hubbard's Hills with its lovely woodland trails along the River Ludd.",
