  "description": "This beautiful gorge in the Brecon Beacons includes a steep-sided valley down which the River Clydach flows to the River Usk. On the way there's peaceful woodland trails and a series of beautiful waterfalls to enjoy. You can start the walk from the public car park in the village of Gilwern, located just to the west of Abergavenny. From here it is a short stroll down to the river where you can pick up footpaths heading south west into the reserve. The route heads to Brynmawr before turning around to retrace your steps. There are various paths to explore both sides of the river if you wish. On the southern side of the route you will link up with the Clydach Gorge Cycle Route. The Sustrans route is largely traffic free with nice surfaced paths to follow. You can see it mapped in orange on the Ordnance Survey Map below.",
