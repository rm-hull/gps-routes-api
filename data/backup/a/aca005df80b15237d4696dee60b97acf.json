In contrast, areas where the bedrock is Moine schist typically feature wet heath and blanket bogs, with a distinct transition between these two types of vegetation evident on the plateau above the crags."

Areas with limestone, fucoid beds, and salterella grits support richer vegetation, including species such as mountain avens and rock sedge. In contrast, regions underlain by Moine schists primarily host wet heath and blanket bog. This variation in vegetation is particularly evident on the plateau above the crags, where small limestone knolls are interspersed with peat-filled areas. Knockan Crag is also home to a variety of bird species, including kestrels, ravens, and ring ouzels, alongside songbirds like dunnocks, wrens, stonechats, and meadow pipits. Red- and black-throated divers are frequently seen at nearby Lochan an Ais during the winter and spring, making them observable from the crag. Additionally, red deer are a common sight as they traverse the site."
