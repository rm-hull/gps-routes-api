It is located close to the lovely Carding Mill Valley and Long Mynd with various long distance trails also running through the area. The town was nicknamed Little Switzerland in the late Victorian and Edwardian period because of its landscape. The local geology includes some of the oldest rocks in England.

The delighful National Trust owned area includes pretty streams, mill pools, waterfalls and a small reservoir. The route then climbs up to Lightspot Hollow where you will find a waterfall in a beautiful V-shaped valley lined with bilberry, bracken and heather. You then head up on to the Long Mynd where you can enjoy fabulous views over the area. This walk then returns to the village via the Jack Mytton Way but you could head south and climb to Pole Bank or head north to explore the Betchcott Hills.

You can find the old pub on the High Street with a postcode of SY6 6BY for your sat navs. The inn is also dog friendly if you have your canine friend in tow."

      "content": "For a longer circular walk in the area you could try the Little Stretton Walk. This starts from the nearby village and visits Ragleth Hill before heading to Church Stretton, the Carding Mill Valley and then up to Pole Bank on the Long Mynd. From Little Stretton there's also the Ashes Hollow Walk which will take you along the Quinny Brook in a stunning V shaped valley. Wenlock Edge is also near the village and one of the highlights of the area. The worthy village of Ratlinghope is located just west of the Pole Bank summit. It's a pretty place located on both the River East Onny and the Darnford Brook. You could explore the village, enjoy a waymarked circular climb to Adstone Hill and then head to The Bridges Pub which is in a lovely riverside spot. Just to the north is the neighbouring village of All Stretton where you can enjoy a climb to the viewpoint on Nover's Hill. For more walking ideas in the area see the Shropshire Hills Walks page."
