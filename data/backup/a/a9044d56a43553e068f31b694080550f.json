Today was slightly early in the season to spot any as they are on vacation in Africa at this time of year. Before the birds return, the nature reserve staff scrape away a new face of sand for the birds to burrow in as the winter weather erodes the previous season's nest holes."

  "description": "This large nature reserve near Lincoln has miles of lovely walking trails to follow around a series of lakes. The reserve also consists of grassland, marsh, scrub and a small area of woodland. It's great for wildlife with birds such as Great crested grebe, Coot and Nightingale to look out for. There are six waymarked walks taking you around Thorpe Lake, Coot Lake, Grebe Lake and the Dragonfly Lakes. There's also a number of smaller ponds and a large area of grazing marsh. Look out for interesting flora such as the pretty purple marsh orchid and various wildlflowers. Facilities are very good with car parking, an informative visitor centre and a nice cafe. There's also a number of bird hides from which to observe the wide variety of wildlife. To continue your walking in the area you could head to the nearby Hartsholme Country Park . The park is only a couple of miles to the north east and has more good footpaths taking you around 200 acres of landscaped gardens, lakes, woodland and grassland. Right next to it you will find Swanholme Lakes Nature reserve where you can look out for more birdlife on the water. A couple of miles to the east there are nice footpaths to follow along the River Witham into Lincoln. If you'd like to visit the reserve by bike then you can follow National Cycle Network Route 64 and Regional Route 93 from the centre of Lincoln. This runs to Skellingthorpe, Swinethorpe and Eagle Moor to the north of the reserve. You can also follow Regional Route 93 along the River Witham and Newark Road to the south of the reserve.",
