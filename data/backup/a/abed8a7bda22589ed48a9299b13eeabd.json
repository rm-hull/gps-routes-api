  "description": "This walk takes you from the cathedral city of Canterbury to the famous port of Dover. The route runs for a distance of about 20 miles along a section of the North Downs Way . The route starts in the city centre near the famous cathedral, where you can pick up the North Downs Way. The waymarked path leads you south east towards St Augustine's Abbey which is worth a small detour from the path. The abbey ruins date from the 6th century and are now owned by English Heritage. The route then leaves the city and heads out into the countryside toward Patrixbourne and then onto the village of Bridge where you will pass the noteworthy Higham Park. Here you will find a\u00a0Grade II listed\u00a0neoclassical\u00a0style house and gardens. The Palladian fronted house dates from the mid 18th century. The next stage takes you through Womenswold to Shepperdswell. At ashley you turn south toward Pineham before coming into Dover. Here you can extend your walk by visiting the fascinating Dover Castle or visiting the famous White Cliffs on the Dover Cliffs Walk .",
