  "description": "A popular walk from the village of Rock to the neighbouring village of Polzeath on the Cornish coast. The walk runs for a distance of about 2.5 miles with some small climbs on the way. It runs along the Camel Estuary with fine views over to Padstow on the other side. The walk starts in Rock where there is a public car park near the coast. From here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow the waymarked footpath north to Cassock Hill and Brea Hill. The route continues past Daymer Bay and the Doom Bar to Trebetherick Point. The final section runs past Broadagogue Cove before finishing in Polzeath. The award winning beach is a popular place for surfers and the little village has some nice shops and cafes to explore.",
