  "description": "A circular walk taking you along the coast to Saundersfoot before heading into the countryside surrounding the Pembrokeshire town. There's some lovey coast and countryside to enjoy, with great views from the high points. The walk starts in Tenby and heads to Saundersfoot with some great cliff tops views. At Saundersfoot you turn west and head towards Moreton and the village of East Williamston. Public footpaths then take you through the countryside to North Astridge, passing farmland and woodland on the way. The final section descends across Cornish Down before finishing back in Tenby. You can extend your walking in the Tenby area by following the Tenby to Lydstep Walk along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path .",

      "content": "From Tenby you can also catch the ferry over to the beautiful Caldey Island where there's interesting rock formations, beautiful bays and lots of seabirds to look out for. Head west along the coast path and you could visit the nearby Manorbier Castle. The Norman castle is in a photogenic position next to the pretty Manorbier Bay. You can also pick up the Manorbier to Freshwater East Walk in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Pembrokeshire Coast Walks page."
