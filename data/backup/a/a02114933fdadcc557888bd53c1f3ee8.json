  "description": "This short coastal walk runs from Malahide to Portmarnock in Fingal. It runs for about 5km (3 miles) on a fairly flat path. There's fine views over the Broadmeadow River estuary to Donabate and a nice section along Portmarnock Beach at the end. On a clear day you can also see Lambay Island and the headland at Howth. Wildlife enthusiasts can look out for a wide variety of sea birds on the way. Starting in Malahide you follow a path running along the coast road. You will pass Malahide Beach and Robswall Park before coming to the martello tower at Portmanock Beach. In Portmanock you can continue your walk along the beach to the 'Southern Cross' memorial on North Beach which commemorates the first successful East-West transatlantic flight made by Australian aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith in his plane 'The Southern Cross' (VH-USU). It took off from the Portmarnock beach on 24 July 1930 and landed in Harbour Grace Newfoundland. To continue your walking in the area head to the nearby Malahide Castle. The historic castle is surrounded by 260 acres (1.1 km2) parkland and gardens with miles of fine walking trails to try. You could also head south and try the Howth Cliff Walk. The route is one of the most popular walks in Ireland, with waymarked footpaths taking you along a series of wonderful cliff tops. The area is also great for wildlife spotting with grey seals and a variety of sea birds to look out for on the way. For a more challenging walk around the Howth peninsula try the Purple Route (Bog of Frogs) which climbs to the hills above the coast. From here there's wonderful views over Portmarnock, Sutton, Bull Island and most of Dublin Bay. You could also head into Dublin and visit Tymon Park. There's a number of nice waymarked woodland trails and waterside paths along the River Poddle here.",

There's nice beaches, island views, a pier and seals to look out for in the harbour of this attractive area. Near here there's also Balbriggan where you can visit the historic Ardgillan Castle. The 18th century country house is surrounded by a splendid 200-acre public park with beautiful gardens, sea views and miles of fine walking trails to try. Also nearby there's the Donabate to Portrane Cliff Walk. You can pick this up just north of Malahide at the 19th century Martello Tower next to Donabate Beach."
