It was designed by the architect Robert Taylor and built at a cost of \u00a319,000 in 1777. It was a toll bridge until 1903, when motorists decided they were no longer prepared to pay and threw the gates into the river. The bridge has 12 arches of which the middle 6 are over the water, with the middle two navigable. The first bridge over the river here was built out of wood in 1280. The centre of the small metal plaque on the near abutment records the maximum water level reached during the November 1894 flood event."

  "description": "This circular walk takes you around the old boundary of Maidenhead. It runs for about 13 miles visiting the boundary stones, the River Thames and Maidenhead Thicket. The walk is an annual event allowing walkers to raise money through sponsorship for their favourite charities whilst enjoying a very interesting walk through some beautiful parts of the Berkshire countryside. It's a nice one do to though as a day walk at anytime of year in smaller groups. This walk starts from Boulter's Lock on the River Thames, where there is a public car park at postcode SL6 8JN for your sat navs. From here you can pick up the Thames Path and follow it south along the river to Dorney Reach where you cross over to Bray and Bray Wick where there is a nature reserve. You continue west to Cox Green before turning north west to Woolley Green and Maidenhead Thicket. Follow the woodland trails north through the thicket and you will come out at Pinkneys Green which is a National Trust owned area of common land. The route then heads east to Furze Platt before coming to Wildbrook Common, another National Trust area. There's lots of good trails, country views and wildlife to see in these connected areas of NT open access land. You then pass Maidenhead Court to return to the river where you turn south. A final waterside section then leads you back to the lock and the car park.",

It's a delightful area thought to have inspired the 'Wind in the Willows' children stories, by the author Kenneth Grahame, who lived in nearby Cookham Deane. The Maidenhead River Walk also starts from Boulter's Lock. It will take you along the Thames Path to nearby Windsor via Dorney Lake and Eton. For more walking ideas in the area see the Berkshire Walks page."
