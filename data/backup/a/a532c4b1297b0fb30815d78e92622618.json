To the north east is the town of Billericay where there's peaceful woodland trails at Norsey Woods and an impressive dam at the expansive Hanningfield Reservoir. Brentwood has another country park in the shape of Weald Country Park. It's located just north west of the town and has a lovely circular trail around a picturesque lake. For more walking ideas in the area see the Essex Walks page."
