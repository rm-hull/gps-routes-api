The fishing port sits on the east side of the Lizard peninsula, just south of the popular town of Falmouth. The walk starts at the car park in the village and then picks up the South West Coast Path to take you along the picturesque harbour and the beach. You'll then pass along Dolor Point, Perprean Cove, The Oxon and Polgravel before coming to the headland at Chynhalls Point. There's great views back to the village from this lovely spot. You then pass along Porthbeer Cove before alternative footpaths take you back to the village.",
