  "description": "Enjoy a circular walk around Warton Crag on this lovely route in Lancashire. The limestone hill near Carnforth stands at 163 metres (535 ft) making it the highest point in the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. It is also a nature reserve with grassland, ancient semi-natural woodland and limestone pavement, supporting some of Britain's rarest butterflies. From the high point there are fabulous views of the River Keer estuary, Morecambe Bay, the Forest of Bowland, the Lake District Fells and the Yorkshire Dales. The area supports rare plants such as Rigid Buckler Fern and Juniper, Pale St. John's Wort and Angular Solomon's-seal. In the woodland area you can find Wood Anemone, Bluebell and Primrose as well as Early Purple Orchid, Violets and Pignut. It is also home to many rare butterflies including Pearl Bordered Fritillary, Small Pearl Bordered Fritillary and High Brown Fritillary. If you would like to continue your walk you could head to the nearby Leighton Moss Nature Reserve where you will find the largest reedbed in the north west and an abundance of wildlife. The Lancashire Coastal Way also runs past Warton Crag so you could pick this up and head towards Arnside Knott where you can find more interesting wildlife and plantlife.",

Here you can pick up the popular Grange-over-Sands and Cartmel Circular Walk which visits the fascinating 12th century Cartmel Priory and the splendidly positioned Hampsfell Hospice. A few miles to the north there's another local geological highlight at Beetham's Fairy Steps. Here you will find an unusual natural limestone staircase which you can climb for more excellent views. The little village of Beetham is also well worth exploring with its 14th century ruined manor house and a particularly lovely garden centre. Near here there's also the market town of Milnthorpe. Here you can enjoy a lovely walk along Milnthorpe Sands to the River Kent Estuary and the wonderful topiary at Levens Hall."
