  "description": "This attractive Leicestershire village has several local country parks and two nearby reservoirs for walkers to explore. This circular walk from the village visits some of the walking highlights of the area including Swithland Reservoir, Swithland Woods, Cropston Reservoir and Bradgate Country Park. The walk starts in the village where you can pick up the Leicestershire Round and follow the waymarked footpath east to visit Swithland Reservoir. The expansive reservoir is a pleasant place for a stroll with lots of birdlife to look out for on the water. The route then heads south to visit Swithland Wood. There's a network of woodland trails here with  pretty streams and mountain bike paths as well. Just south of the woods you'll come to Cropston Reservoir where you can enjoy a waterside stroll along the northern end of the water. Here you'll also find the lovely Bradgate Park where there's 830 acres of deer park to explore. You can follow the Leicestershire Round north through the park to the viewpoint at Old John Tower before continuing past Maplewell Farm to return to the village. You can extend the walk by heading a short distance north east of the village to visit Beacon Hill Country Park .",
