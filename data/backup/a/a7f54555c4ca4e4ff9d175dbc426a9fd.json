  "description": "This circular walk from Shipton Under Wychwood visits the Foxholes Nature Reserve and the neighbouring villages of Milton under Wychwood and Ascott Under Wychwood. The route includes views of the River Evenlode, woodland sections and nice trails through the Cotswolds countryside. The walk starts at the northern end of the village where you can pick up the Oxfordshire Way. The waymarked trail heads north west, running parallel to the River Evenlode. After about 2 miles, you turn south west to enter the Foxholes Nature Reserve. Here there's some nice woodland trails with bluebells in the spring and the chance of spotting a wild deer if you are lucky. The reserve is also good for birds such as nuthatch and treecreeper. In the summer months look out for various butterflies fluttering around the wild honeysuckle. From the reserve the route then heads south west, passing Starveall Wood and Herbert's Heath, before coming out of the woods near Fifield. Here you turn south east to head towards Milton Under Wychwood. From here you follow Dog Kennel Lane back into Shipton. There is an optional detour east to visit Ascott Under Wychwood which can be reached on the Oxfordshire Way.",

      "content": "Head east from the village and you can explore the woodland trails at Wychwood Forest and visit the lakes and deer park at Cornbury Park near Charlbury. The village is also located close to the picture postcard Cotswold villages of Burford, Bourton on the Water and Stow on the Wold. The D'arcy Dalton Way passes through the area. This waymarked long distance trail starts off to the north at Wormleighton Reservoir and heads south through the Cotswolds towards Ashbury. It's a good way of further stretching your legs if you have time."
