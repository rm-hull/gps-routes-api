The white house with the bay windows is the former Harbour Office which was still in use up to the 1930s. The small stone building on the skyline by the blue forestay of the yacht is the 'Pepperpot'. This was built around 1800 to serve as a Pilot's lookout."

  "description": "This north Cornish fishing village has a pretty harbour and two popular sandy beaches. As such it's a nice place to start a walk with coastal paths in both directions and a local country park to visit as well. This walk takes you from Portreath to Hayle along the coastal path. The walk starts in the village and heads south along the South West Coast Path, passing Carvannel Downs and Tehidy Country Park on the way. You continue along Reskajeage Downs to Hudder Down and Godrevy Head, where you will pass the lighthouse. After rounding the headland you continue south past, Gwithian and Towans before arriving in Hayle where you can enjoy a stroll along the beautiful Hayle Estuary .",
