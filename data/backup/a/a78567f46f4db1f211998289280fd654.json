  "description": "Enjoy fabulous views of the Exmoor coastline on this bracing climb near Porlock. The area also includes attractive flora including bell heather, ling heather and western gorse. Look out for wildlife including buzzards, peregrine falcons, kestrels. The walk starts from the car park at the end of Hill Road, just east of the village of Bossington. You then head north along public footpaths before picking up a section of the South West Coast Path to take you towards the hill summit. From here there are lovely views over the Bristol Channel to the Welsh coast. An alternative route is to follow the coast path from the village of Bossington to Hurlstone Point. Then turn south to reach the hill. You can easily extend the walk by exploring the Holnicote Estate and climbing to Selworthy Beacon. The beacon is located just to the east of Bossington Hill. Also nearby are the settlements of Porlock and Porlock Weir . Porlock Weir is particularly lovely, with 17th century cottages and a delightful harbour.",
