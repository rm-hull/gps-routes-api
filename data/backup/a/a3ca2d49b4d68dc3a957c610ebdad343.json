  "description": "This circular walk from the Goytre Wharf takes you along a section of the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal before exploring the countryside to the west of the wharf. Goytre Wharf is a popular place for walks with a good sized car park, boat hire, heritage centre and on site cafe. The walk stars from the car park on the Old Abergavenny Road. From here you can pick up the canal towpath and follow it south towards Park-y-Brain. Here you can link up with the Marches Way and follow the waymarked trail north west into the lovely surrounding countryside. You'll pass the woodland around Pentre Hill and Wern Wood before following a country lane east, back to the canal around Pentcroescoped. You can extend your walking around the wharf by following the canal north to visit Llanfoist and Abergavenny where you can explore Abergavenny Castle Meadows and Linda Vista Gardens or enjoy a climb to the viewpoint at the Sugarloaf. Near here there's also the pretty Gilwern Wharf where there's some lovely scenery and a fine canalside pub.",
