  "description": "This pretty village is located in a lovely spot on the River Stour on the Suffolk/Essex county border. There's some lovely river trails and the wonderful Dedham Vale AONB just to the east. This circular walk from the village uses sections of the Stour Valley Path and the St Edmund Way to explore the area to the east of the settlement. The walk starts in the village centre where you can pick up the Stour Valley Path. Follow the waymarked trail south east and it will take you past Bures Mill and Wormingford Mere to the neighbouring village of Wormingford. The route continues past Garnons Chase, Bottengoms and Little Horkesley where you turn north to Wiston Mill and Weir. From here it is a short walk into Nayland where you could stop for a rest and refreshment at what is roughly the half way point on the walk. From Nayland you head west to pick up the St Edmund Way. This long distance footpath will take you west through the countryside back to Bures. This section of the walk passes Wissington Grange and the Arger Fen bird reserve.",
