  "description": "Climb to Shaftoe Crags and enjoy far ranging views over the Northumberland countryside on this circular walk near Morpeth. The area is geologically significant with a number of interesting rock formations including the Devil's Punchbowl. The crags reach a height of nearly 700ft. From this elevated position the views over the surrounding area are magnificent, with the Northumbrian coast visible on a clear day. There are also evidence of ancient occupation with a number of Iron Age burial mounds. The crags are located just west of Bolam Lake Country Park so you could continue your walking here. There's an old standing stone and Tumulus between the crags and the lake which you'll pass on the way. You could also start the walk from the country park and cross the moorland to the crags. A short distance to the north west you will find the National Trust's Wallington Hall where there's lakes, woodland, parkland and a beautiful walled garden.",
