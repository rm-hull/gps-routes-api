  "description": "This Hertfordshire based town is located near Bishop's Stortford and Harlow close to the border with Essex. The interesting town has some lovely riverside trails and an expansive local park to explore. This circular walk from the town uses sections of the Stort Valley Way and the Harcamlow Way to explore the area to the south of the town. The walk starts at the train station and heads south along the River Stort Navigation with pretty locks and weirs to see. Follow the waterside footpath south and it will take you past Feakes Lock towards Old Harlow. The route then turns north passing the historic Pishiobury Park which includes \u2018Capability\u2019 Brown style landscape features. There's also wet woodland (The Osier Bed), grazed fields and flood meadows to admire here. The route finishes by heading through Nursery Wood before exploring the town centre and returning to the train station.",
