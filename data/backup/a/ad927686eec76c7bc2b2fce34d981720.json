He is better supported in Europe and the Middle East, with stained glass at both Chartres and Rouen Cathedrals, but is mentioned in the Prologue of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. There are two versions of his story, agreeing in general apart from the reason for his acts of charity only being penitence for murder, the other (with his equally devoted wife) the result of a vision on his marriage night. Dedicated in the 9th century, the story was first quoted by St Antonine in circa 387AD. However, many later writings claim the former to be entirely mythical, since he has no fixed date, no country of origin, nor tomb or record of burial, while the latter is usually a joint dedication with that of his wife, Bassilissa."

  "description": "This Somerset based town is located on the northern slopes of the Mendip Hills and also close to the Cotswolds Hills AONB. There's nice walks through the Wellow Valley and easy rail trails along disused railway lines to try. This walk from the town follows an old railway line along the Wellow Brook to the nearby village of Wellow. You'll pass a number of pretty brookside villages and a noteworthy ancient site at Stony Littleton. The walk starts from West Hill Gardens and heads east past the old church to the eastern side of the town. Here you can pick up the shared cycling and walking trail and follow it east past Tyning, Lower Writhlington, Shoscombe and Stony Littleton where you will pass an ancient Long Barrow to the south of the brook. Shortly after you come into the little village of Wellow.",
