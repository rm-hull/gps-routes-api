The South West Coast Path snakes through the scene towards the small car park and the cliffs on the left drop down into Barley Bay. In this remote corner of the most northwesterly point in Devon, and after several kilometres of narrow, single-track roads, I was amazed to find a small cafe by the car park."

  "description": "Visit Hartland Point on this circular walk on the beautiful Hartland Peninsula in Devon. It's a great place to get some sea air and admire the fantastic coastal views. The dramatic location is where the Bristol Channel meets the Atlantic Ocean. There's rocky cliffs and views of the wrecked ship MS  Johanna which ran aground on the rocks below. It's also great for wildlife watching with skuas, terns and shearwaters to look out for. There's a car park close to the point near Blagdon Farm, West Titchberry. From here you can pick up the South West Coast Path to take you along Barley Bay towards the 19th century Hartland Point Lighthouse. The route then continues along Blagdon Cliff and Upright Cliff, before turning east and returning to the car park through the countryside. To extend your walk you can follow the South West Coast Path south and visit the delightful Hartland Quay .",
