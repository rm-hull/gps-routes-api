  "description": "This expansive area of moorland near Buxton has some fine walking trails to try. The moor sits in an elevated position some (551 metres (1,808 ft) above sea level. It is notable as the source of the River Dove, River Manifold, River Dane, River Wye and River Goyt. This walk takes you from Poole's Cavern and Buxton Country Park to the old pack horse bridge at Three Shires Head. It uses a section of the Dane Valley Way to explore the area. Start the walk at the car park at Poole's Cavern and Buxton Country Park, located on the eastern side of the moor. From here you can pick up the Dane Valley Way and follow it south west on to the moor. It will take you to Orchard Common before coming to Three Shires Head. It's a very picturesque spot where the counties of Cheshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire meet. There's a fine Grade II-listed packhorse bridge over the River Dane and lots of pretty waterfalls to see here too. The route then heads north from the bridge past Cut-thorn Hill towards Danebower Hollow and Cheshire Knowl. Here the trail passes the old Danebower quarries and Reeve- Edge quarries before returning to Orchard Common. You then retrace your steps, passing Cheeks Hill and Dane Head before returning to the car park in the park.",

It's located at a postcode of SK11 0AR for your sat navs."
