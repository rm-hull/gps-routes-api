  "description": "Enjoy a lovely riverside walk along the River Ribble on this walk from Eddisford Bridge in Clitheroe. It's a lovely section of the river with nice views of the Ribble Valley countryside and seating to rest your legs by the water. The walk starts from the Eddisford Road car park on the western edge of Clitheroe. You could also start from Clitheroe train station and head west to the river from there. From the bridge the you can pick up the Ribble Way long distance trail and follow it south to Great Mitton, via Shuttleworth Farm. Here you cross the river at Mitton Bridge and follow other trails through the countryside back to the river. The route then follows the other side of the river back to the car park. To extend the walk continue along the river to Hurst Green where you can pick up the Tolkien Trail. The literary trail explores an area connected with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. You could also try our walk around Clitheroe which explores the historic castle before heading to the River Ribble and the pretty Cross Hill Nature Reserve.",

      "content": "Just to the north is the pretty village of Sawley. Here you can visit the ruins of the 12th century Sawley Abbey which is run by English Heritage. The river is particularly scenic here and there's also a splendid riverside pub for post walk refreshments. Just west of here is the neighbouring village of Waddington. The village is very pretty and a regular winner of the Lancashire Best Kept Village awards. A stroll along the Waddington Brook and through the delightful Coronation gardens is recommended here. To the east is Gisburn with its fine 18th century coaching inn and views of the Stock Beck. Also to the north is the worthy village of Bolton by Bowland where there's two pretty village greens and views of the Skirden Beck."
