  "description": "Enjoy an easy waterside stroll around Linlithgow Loch. The walk takes you past the ruins of Linlithgow Palace and the parkland surrounding it (known as the peel). The palace has a magnificent hall, a beautiful fountain, a courtyard and a number of wonderful sculptures. It's a good, flat path, running for a distance of just over 2 miles so it should take about an hour to stroll round. The loch is a haven for wildfowl - look out for great crested grebes and little grebes, \ncoots, moorhens, tufted duck and mallard.  For cyclists there are some paths around the peel where bikes are allowed. If you would like to continue your walk you could follow the Union Canal from Linlithgow to the nearby Muiravonside Country Park which has miles of woodland cycling and walking trails. See the Linlithgow Canal Walk page for more details.",
