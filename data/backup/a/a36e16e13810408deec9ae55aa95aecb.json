Inside the cove are large rock-pools with many types of sea anemones and seaweeds. To the north is a distinctive rock close to the cliff known as the 'Diamond Horse'. There are also a number of other caves further round the beach. The sands here feature in one variation on the folklore tale of Jan Tregeagle. It is said that his Sisyphean task is to try and sweep the sand from Porthcurno cove around the Gwennap Head into Nanjizal Bay. On stormy winter nights you can hear him howling with despair at the futility of his task."

      "caption": "Sandy beach in Nanjizal Bay (or Mill Bay). This beach is only a mile or so south of the Lands End tourist trap, but as it is not served by any roads or car parks, and can only really be reached by a hilly walk along the coastal footpath, it is not busy with tourists - even in high season. The amount of sand on the beach varies - apparently much of it was stripped away in a storm a few years ago, but it is being replenished by natural processes. The bay is also known as \"Mill Bay\", after the mill just above the beach that was driven by water from the stream which cascades down the cliff. The fresh water disappears below the sand and at low tide emerges further down the beach when it meets the underlying rock."

  "description": "This popular walk takes you from Sennen Cove to the stunning Nanjizal or Mill Bay. The secluded cove is a good place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist trap at Land's End. It's about a 3 mile walk along the cliff top path, passing Land's End, Trevescan Cliff and Pordenack Point on the way. The walk starts from the Sennen Cove car park on the western side of the beautiful Whitesand Bay. From here you can pick up the South West Coast Path and follow the waymarked footpath south to Nanjizal. Here you will find a glorious bay, cove, rock pools and a beach with excellent bird watching opportunities. Look out for chiffchaff, whitethroat, dunnock, Eurasian blackcap, Eurasian wren and sedge warbler in this peaceful area.",
