  "description": "This circular walk explores the lakes and woods to the east of the West Sussex village of Balcombe. On the route you'll visit the lovely Ardingly Reservoir and the beautiful gardens at the historic Wakehurst Place. There's also a waterside stretch along the pretty Balcombe Lake to enjoy. The walk starts in the village and heads east to Balcombe Mill and the Ardingly Reservoir. You then follow a waterside path along the eastern side of the expansive reservoir. Here you will see a mixture of habitats including wetland, reedbed, deciduous woodland, hazel coppice and haymeadow. Look out for Great crested grebe and kingfishers as you make your way round the reservoir. The path then turns north through Bushy Wood toward Wakehurst Place, the country estate of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. There are 465 acres of wonderful gardens to explore on a number of well laid out footpaths here. After exploring Wakehurst the route then heads west through Tilgate Wood to Balcombe Lake. Here you pass along the pretty lake with views of the Chalybeate Spring which is flanked by two ancient yew trees. Shortly after you return to the village where the walk finishes.",
