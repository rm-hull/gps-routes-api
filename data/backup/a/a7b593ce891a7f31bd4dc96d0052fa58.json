  "description": "This stunning circular walk explores the area around the town of Llanidloes in Powys. You begin at Llanidloes and pass along the beautiful Llyn Clywedog with its large dam, before climbing into the Cambrian mountains, where you will arrive at the highest point of the range at Plynlimon. Here you will find the source of the River Severn - the longest river in Britain, marked with a post in both English and Welsh. The route then returns to Llanidloes, passing through Hafren Forest, before joining the River Severn for a long waterside section that leads you to the finish point of the walk. The walk is named after the Celtic myth of Sabrina, a water nymph said to inhabit the waters of the River Severn."
