  "description": "This is the section of the Beacon Way from Sandwell to Chasewater, taking in the nature reserves, canals and woodland around Walsall. You start by the restored, Victorian Sandwell Park Farm in West Bromwich and head through the lovely Sandwell Valley Country Park. You continue past Rushall Junction and onto Barr Beacon where there are splendid views of the surrounding countryside. Pleasant waterside sections along the Rushall Canal and Wyrley and Essington Canal lead you to the finish point at Chasewater Country Park. Here there's a beautiful lake, and the heritage Chasewater Railway .",
