  "description": "This pretty Berkshire village is located close to the River Thames near Windsor. This walk from the village visits the National Trust's Ankerwycke where there's an ancient yew and a ruined priory to see. The walk starts on the village green next to the mock windmill. From here you can follow footpaths south to Ankerwycke Farm and Priory ruins. You'll also pass the 2,500 year old Ankerwycke Yew which is the National Trust's oldest tree. It is rumoured that beneath the tree King Henry VIII courted Anne Boleyn, and some reports suggest that he even proposed in its shadow. While the Magna Carta is said to have been sealed at Runnymede on the other side of the Thames, some think it was sealed on tihs side of the river, perhaps under the ancient yew. You can enjoy a stroll down to the river before circling round and returning to the village. To extend your walking in the area head north east to visit Wraysbury Reservoir and Staines Moor .",
