  "description": "This walk visits a beautiful beach in the north western part of the Isle of Skye. The attractive beach is a popular place to visit bur rarely crowded as it is at least 2 miles from the nearest road. The walk starts just south of the beach at the parking area at Glen Claigan. Here you will find a handy information board and the start of the footpath to the beach. This will take you north west to the coast where you can enjoy some fine views over Loch Dunvegan. You'll pass Camas Bay before coming to the Coral Beaches with its stunning white sands and turquoise sea. You can continue your walking in the area by heading to the nearby Waternish Point where you'll find an ancient ruined church and the Vaternish Lighthouse. The historic Dunvegan Castle and Gardens are located just to the south as well.",

To the south east there's some interesting ancient history at Dun Beag Broch. The Iron Age site is one of the best-preserved examples of a broch in Scotland."
