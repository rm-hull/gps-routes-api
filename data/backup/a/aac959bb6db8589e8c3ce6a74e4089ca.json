  "description": "This is a lovely, easy riverside walk along the River Medway from Tonbridge to Rochester . You start at Tonbridge castle and head east towards Maidstone via Yalding and East Farleigh. The second section takes you onto Rochester via the attractive Allington Lock . The landscape is varied and includes  woodland, orchards, meadows and farmland. You will also pass through a series of pretty riverside villages and towns which are steeped in history. For wildlife lovers look out for Kingfishers and listen out for the sweet song of the nightingale. Route highlights include the pretty Leybourne Lakes Country Park around Aylesford and Snodland . You could also take a small detour near Burham to visit the ancient Medway Megaliths .",
