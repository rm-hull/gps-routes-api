  "description": "Enjoy stunning coastal views on this circular walk on the Pembrokeshire Coast. Dinas Island is actually a peninsula with a wonderful 466ft (142m) viewpoint at the high point known as Pen-y-fan.  It's a steep climb but you are rewarded with wonderful views of Cardigan Bay, Fishguard Bay, Snowdonia and the Llyn Peninsula. The headland itself is very attractive, covered with a variety of plants and flowers including gorse, bracken, hawthorn, blackthorn, heather, foxglove and orchids. There's also good birdwatching opportunities as you may see choughs, peregrine falcons and various other sea birds. The walk starts at the car park at Cwm Yr Eglwys at the south eastern end of Dinas Island. You then follow the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to Pen-y-fan passing the Old Sailor Pub on the way. You can also reach Dinas Island by following the Pembrokeshire Coast Path from nearby Fishguard. To extend your walking in the area head south and visit the delightful Gwaun Valley. The peaceful valley has lovely riverside footpaths and attractive woodland to enjoy.",
