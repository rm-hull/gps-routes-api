  "description": "This lovely park in south London is a great place to go for a walk or cycle in the city. The Wandle Trail runs through the park along the River Wandle with pretty bridges across the water and lots of wildlife to look out for. There's also a rushing weir and a restored waterwheel which gives an insight into the industrial history of the park. Water loving birds you might see include herons, egrets and kingfishers. Other features in the park include a delightful rose garden with over 2000 roses, wide lawns ideal for picnics and an excellent learning centre housed in the western mill. There are also many interesting buildings on the site including Morden Hall itself, Morden Cottage, an old Snuff Mill and several old farm buildings which are now used as a garden centre and a city farm. There's a car park at the site but you can also easily visit the park by public transport. The Phipps Bridge, Belgrave Walk and Morden Road Tramlink stops and Morden Tube Station are very close to the park. You can extend your outing by heading to the nearby Ravensbury Park and Mitcham Common where you will find a number of good footpaths taking you to woodland, grassland, scrub and the pretty Seven Islands pond. You can also follow the course of the River Wandle on the excellent Wandle Trail. If you head north from the park you will soon come to the lovely Merton Abbey Mills where you will find a pretty water mill and an arts and craft market.",
