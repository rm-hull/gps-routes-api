  "description": "This is a popular coastal walk between Newquay and Perranporth along a section of the South West Coast Path. The walk is about 11 miles so it's perfect for a day's outing. It's a fantastic stretch of coast with lovely beaches, exhilirating cliff tops and beautiful bays. At Perranporth you can enjoy refreshments before catching the bus back to Newquay. The walk starts off in the centre of the popular tourist town of Newquay, near to the train station and the bus station. You then follow the coast path through the town towards Towan Head where there are lovely views over the Newquay beaches. The path then heads along the popular surfing spot of Fistral Beach. You then cross the River Gannel to Crantock Sands which may require the use of the ferry at high tide. The route then visits Pentire Point and Kelsey Head before descending to the beautiful Holywell Beach which has a wonderful dune system and is managed by the National Trust. The route then rounds Penhale Point before crossing Penhale Sands which has the most extensive system of sand dunes in Cornwall.  After crossing the sands you arrive at the pretty little town of Perranporth where you can enjoy a well earned drink at the UK's only bar on the beach. To extend your walk you can continue along the coast path to St Agnes Head and enjoy a climb to St Agnes Beacon and a visit to the fascinating ruins of the Wheal Coates tin mine. See the Perranporth to St Agnes Walk for details of the route to the headland. Beyond there is the pretty village of Porthtowan. A few miles north of Newquay you can visit the Bedruthan Steps, a series of large photogenic rocks along the beach.",
