  "description": "These delightful falls are located on the south western shore of Little Loch Broom in the Scottish Highlands near Dundonnell. The site is a real hidden gem with a walking trail taking you up to a series of picturesque waterfalls. You can start the walk from the parking area off the A832, just north of the falls. Then climb the footpath heading south along the Ardessie Burn gorge to the falls. It's a lovely spot with the rushing falls and fine views back to Loch Broom. The path can get quite wet and muddy so a good pair of walking shoes is advised, particularly after wet weather.",

The climb to Beinn Eighe, the still waters of Loch Clair and Loch Coulin and the Gairloch Waterfall Walk in Flowerdale Glen are also in this area. Also nearby is the town of Ullapool where you can climb to the viewpoint at Ullapool Hill and catch the ferry over to Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides. Head west and you could visit the worthy village of Poolewe and enjoy a stroll around the beautiful Inverewe Garden. The lochside gardens are a lovely place for a stroll with some nice footpaths taking you to subtropical plants, fine lawns and beautiful flowers. You can also enjoy fine views over Loch Ewe in this scenic area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Scottish Highlands Walks page."
