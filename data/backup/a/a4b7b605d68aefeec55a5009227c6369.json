  "description": "Enjoy a short, peaceful stroll through these delightful woods on the edge of the Cotswolds. The area consists of Broadleaved and conifer woodland with a number of woodland walking trails to try. There are lovely views over the surrounding Warwickshire countryside from the forest too. Look out for various wildflowers, bluebells and wildlife including fallow deer. After your walk you can enjoy refreshments at the pub in the village of Whichford. The Macmillan Way long distance footpath runs through the woods so you could pick this up to extend your walk through Long Compton Woods to the village of Long Compton. If you continue south you will soon come to the fascinating Rollright Stones . The group of Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monuments consists of three groups of stones: the King's Men stone circle, the Whispering Knights burial chamber and the single King Stone.",
