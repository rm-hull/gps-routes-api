  "description": "Follow the Thames Path from Putney to Richmond on this easy waterside walk in London. The walk runs for just under 9 miles, passing a number of the highlights of the area. You start off at Putney Bridge and head north west passing Barnes where there's some nice trails on Barnes Common and lots of wildlife to see at the London Wetland Centre. You continue past Hammersmith Bridge, Barnes Bridge, Chiswick Bridge and Kew Bridge before coming to the famous Kew Gardens. The river path runs along side the gardens and the Old Deer Park with Syon Park on the other side of the water. The final stretch takes you past the pretty Richmond Lock before coming to the end of the route at Richmond Bridge. You can extend the walk by heading to the lovely gardens at Marble Hill Park or exploring the expansive Richmond Park. To continue along the river try the Richmond to Kingston Walk .",
