  "description": "This walk in Northumberland visits the Gothic style\u00a0country\u00a0mansion of Featherstone Castle. The Grade I listed castle sits in a fine position for walks with waterside trails along the River South Tyne and some fine countryside to enjoy. This circular walk starts from the public car park just east of the castle. From here you head north west to the castle and then follow footpaths south along the river to Lambley Viaduct . You then pick up the South Tyne Trail at Coanwood and following it back towards the castle. On the river trail you will also pass the Featherstone Prisoner of War Camp which was opened in 1944 to accommodate American soliders arriving for the Normandy invasions. At the southern end of the route there's the impressive Lambley Viaduct. The photogenic structure dates from 1852 and includes 9 arches standing at a height of 35 metres (110 feet). Near here there's also the old South Tyne railway with the remains of the station at Coanwood to see.",
