  "description": "This major UK city is located in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The city has an interesting history having played a major part in textiles manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution. There's also a number of interesting Victorian buildings and the Grade I listed Bradford Cathedral to visit in the city. For walkers there's some fine local parks and canalside trails to pick up just to the north in Shipley. This walk in Bradford visits Peel Park in in the Bolton and Undercliffe part of the city. The expansive park covers 56 acres and includes various footpaths taking you to statues, fountains and lakes. Just to the west you can also visit the award winning Lister Park. There's a pretty lake and a noteoworthy Mughal Water Garden to see here.",
