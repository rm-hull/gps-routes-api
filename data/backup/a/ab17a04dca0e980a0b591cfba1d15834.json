  "description": "This pretty village in Nottinghamshire is a nice place for country walks or a village stroll. The settlement is notable as England\u2019s Last Open Field Village, meaning it still operates the medieval \u2018open field\u2019 farming system whereby the three fields are divided into strips. These strips are then worked by the local farmers  under the jurisdiction of a Court Leet and jury. The historic settlement includes many notable features including a 12th century church and a Norman motte and bailey castle. This circular walk takes you to the neighbouring village of Egmanton. You'll follow a mixture of public footpaths and country lanes for a distance of just under 8 miles. There's nice countryside views and a series of farms on the way. You'll also pass the Beth Shalom Holocaust Centre which includes an exhibition centre with lecture theatre, and a Memorial Garden. It lies on the walk just west of the village.",
