  "description": "This circular walk takes you to the lovely Loughrigg Tarn from Skelwith Bridge. The walk starts from the Skelwith Bridge Hotel and follows country lanes and footpaths around the pretty tarn. It's a fairly easy climb to the high point above the tarn with splendid views of the surrounding fells. It's a secluded peaceful spot which was a favourite of William Wordsworth. It's possible to continue your walk north and climb to the top of Loughrigg Fell. The Colwith Force waterfall walk also starts from Skelwith Bridge. It follows the Cumbria Way to the 40ft falls through some lovely countryside and woodland. If you would like to visit the tarn from Ambleside then try our Ambleside to Skelwith Bridge Walk which visits the tarn.",
