  "description": "This elevated market town in Wiltshire is located a few miles north of Swindon and just east of Faringdon. The town itself includes some fine Georgian buildings while walkers can enjoy some nice country trails through the Upper Thames Valley. This walk from the town takes you through the countryside to visit the neighbouring village of Hannington where you'll pass the historic Hannington Hall. The walk starts on the northern side of the town where you can pick up footpaths heading north west past Crouch Hill. Near Pentylands Farm you can pick up the Burford Stone Lane track and follow it south west to Hannington. On the way you'll pass the Grade II listed country house of Hannington Hall, which dates back to 1653. The hall is surrounded by 340 acres of photogenic pasture and woodland. After exploring the pretty village of Hannington the route returns to Highworth on the same paths.",
