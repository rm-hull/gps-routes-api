  "description": "Enjoy cycling and walking along the towpath of this lovely canal in Gloucestershire. The whole of the route is suitable for walkers while cyclists can enjoy several sections as well. National Cycle Route 41 of the National Cycle Network runs along the canal from Gloucester Docks to the outskirts of the city. There's also another section from Frampton on Severn to Shepherd's Patch. The canal runs from Gloucester Docks to Sharpness with wonderful views of the Severn Estuary, the Forest of Dean and the Cotswolds. Route highlights include Gloucester Docks with its variety of shops, leisure facilities, marina and fascinating Gloucester Waterways Museum. You will also pass the wonderful Slimbridge Wetland Centre where you can see thousands of migrant birds. The route finishes at the dock of Sharpness Port which was opened in 1874. The canal links nicely with the River Severn in several places so you have the option of picking up the Severn Way and continuing your walk. Just before the end of the route at Sharpness you will pass the Purton Hulks. Here you will pass a number of abandoned boats deliberately beached beside the River Severn to reinforce the river banks next to the canal.",
