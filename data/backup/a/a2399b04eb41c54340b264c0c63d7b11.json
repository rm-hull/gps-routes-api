These all indicate a permanent occupation and date from the 1st century BC."

      "caption": "The Imber Range Path heads up Scratchbury Hill. Scratchbury Camp fort encompasses an area of 37 acres (15 hectares) and occupies the summit of a hill on the edge of Salisbury Plain, with its four-sided shape largely following the natural contours of the hill. The Iron Age hillfort dates to around 100 BC and contains the remains of an earlier, smaller D-shaped enclosure or camp. The age of this earlier earthwork is currently debated, with interpretations varying due to the inconclusive and incomplete nature of previous excavation records. Some suggest it dates to the early Iron Age around 250 BC, while others propose it could be from the Bronze Age, around 2000 BC. Within the fort, there are seven tumuli, which were excavated in the 19th century by Sir Richard Colt Hoare and William Cunnington. These excavations revealed relics of bone, pottery, flint, brass, and amber jewellery, most of which are now displayed at the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes. Additionally, various items have been found in and around the site, including Roman artefacts and Neolithic flint and jade axe heads."

  "description": "This walk takes you to an ancient Hillfort and viepwoint in Warminster , Wiltshire. There's decent footpaths leading up to the hill top from Sack Hill Road which lies just to the north of the site. Here you will find a hill fort dating to the Late Bronze Age & the Iron Age (800 BCE\u2013200 BCE). You can walk around the ancient banks and ditches while enjoying a splendid view of the surrounding hills and countryside. The hill stands at a height of 208 metres so it is a reasonable climb to the top. You can extend the walk by picking up the Imber Range Perimeter Path and following it south to visit Scratchbury Hill. The route could then be followed further around the MOD's area on Salisbury Plain .",
