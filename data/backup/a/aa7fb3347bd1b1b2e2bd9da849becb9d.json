  "description": "Explores 85 acres of woodland on this circular walk through Sunnyhurst Woods in Darwen. There's a nice stream running through the woods with good waterside footpaths on either side. It's perfect for a peaceful stroll and a picnic. The area is also a nature reserve so look out for a wide variety of flowering plants and birdlife including the great spotted woodpecker, nuthatch, tree creeper, kingfisher and tawny owl. There is also a pretty visitor centre with information about all the trails in the woods. This circular walk takes you through the woods and then past the neighbouring reservoirs of Earnsdale and Sunnyhurst Hey. Near the reservoirs there are great views across the moorland to Jubilee Tower. If you would like to extend your walk then you could pick up the Witton Weavers Way and climb Darwen Tower for great views over the surrounding countryside.",
