  "description": "Enjoy a circular river walk on this easy route in the pretty Northumberland village of Blanchland. It's a gem of place with picturesque cottages, set against a backdrop of deep woods and open moors. The village was largely built of stone from the remains of the 12th-century Abbey. It's situated in a great spot in the Derwent Valley area of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The walk follows a section of the River Derwent from Blanchland to Baybridge, with the option of returning through the countryside or on the opposite side of the river.",

      "content": "The historic Lord Crewe Arms Hotel is a fine choice for some post walk refreshments. They have a good menu and a lovely, large garden area to relax in on warmer days. Inside there's the atmospheric Crypt bar, tucked away in a medieval vaulted chamber and lit with a candle-like ambience. The hotel also has a long and interesting history having been built in 1165 as a guest house to the newly-formed Blanchland Abbey. The guest house enjoyed 400 years of self-sufficiency and hospitality, until the dissolution of the Abbeys of England in 1539. It later became the Lord Crewe Arms providing the local lead miners with a place to relax after their shifts. The hotel also provides good quality accommodation with the rooms maintaining medieval features such as ogee-arched windows and stone chimneypieces. You can find the hotel on the Square at postcode DH8 9SP for your sat navs."
