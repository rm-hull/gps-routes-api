  "description": "Enjoy a circular river walk on this easy route in the pretty Northumberland village of Blanchland. It's a gem of place with picturesque cottages, set against a backdrop of deep woods and open moors. The village was largely built of stone from the remains of the 12th-century Abbey. It's situated in a great spot in the Derwent Valley area of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The walk follows a section of the River Derwent from Blanchland to Baybridge, with the option of returning through the countryside or on the opposite side of the river.",
