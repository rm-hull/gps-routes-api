  "description": "This circular walk explores the wooded valley of Pleasley Vale on the Derbyshire\u00a0and\u00a0Nottinghamshire border. There's some lovely walking paths here taking you along the River Meden to the old Pleasley mills and a nature reserve. Here you can look out for a variety of flora and fauna including several different species of butterfly\u00a0and woodpecker. You can then follow footpaths along Littlewood Lane and Northfield Lane to create a loop walk through the area to the south of the vale. On the southern side of the river there's also a cycle path along the River Meden Railway Trail which leads towards Mansfield .",
