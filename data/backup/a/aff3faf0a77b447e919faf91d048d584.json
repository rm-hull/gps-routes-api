  "description": "This walk follows the Afon Llugwy from Betws-y-Coed to the beautiful Swallow Falls in the Snowdonia National Park. This is a popular riverside walk, passing along woodland trails with a series of waterfalls to enjoy. The walk starts in the delightful village of Betws-y-Coed in the Conwy valley. The area is popular with walkers as it is surrounded by some wonderful woodland trails, the Clogwyn Cyrrau Nature Reserve, the Llyn Elsi, and the rivers Conwy, Llugwy and Lledr. This walk takes you along the Llugwy passing the wooden Miners Bridge and several smaller waterfalls before coming to Swallow Falls. The falls are charming and are best enjoyed after wet weather. You can enjoy refreshments at the nearby Swallow Falls Hotel. If you enjoy this walk then you could head to the nearby Conwy Falls. Here you will find a short circular trail through the Conwy Forest Park. This takes you to the River Conwy where you will find the lovely 50 ft waterfall. Also nearby is the delightful Fairy Glen where you can enjoy little waterfalls, rapids and cascades in a magical wooded gorge on the River Conwy.",

Outside there's pretty landscaped gardens and a nice patio area to relax in on warmer days. At the western end of the walk there's also the noteworthy Ugly House. This quaint old cottage has an interesting history and a pleasant little cafe. There's also some lovely gardens with a bird-feeder, wildlife pond and white cliffs. The site is something of a hidden gem and well worth exploring if you have time. You can find them just west of the falls at postcode LL24 0DS for your sat navs."

This takes you through the beautiful scenery of the Lledr Gorge with its picturesque waterfalls, stepping stones and Pont Gethin viaduct. There's also the option of trying the Victorian Fishermans Walk, a precarious route through the gorge on a rickety old walkway."
