  "description": "This walk follows the\u00a0Afon Llugwy from Betws-y-Coed to the beautiful Swallow Falls in the Snowdonia National Park. This is a popular riverside walk, passing along woodland trails with a series of waterfalls to enjoy. The walk starts in the delightful village of Betws-y-Coed in the Conwy valley. The area is popular with walkers as it is surrounded by some wonderful woodland trails, the Clogwyn Cyrrau Nature Reserve, the Llyn Elsi, and the rivers Conwy, Llugwy\u00a0and Lledr. This walk takes you along the Llugwy passing the wooden Miners Bridge and several smaller waterfalls before coming to Swallow Falls. The falls are charming and are best enjoyed after wet weather. You can enjoy refreshments at the nearby Swallow Falls Hotel. If you enjoy this walk then you could head to the nearby Conwy Falls . Here you will find a short circular trail through the Conwy Forest Park.  This takes you to the River Conwy where you will find the lovely 50 ft waterfall. Also nearby is the delightful Fairy Glen where you can enjoy little waterfalls, rapids and cascades in a magical wooded gorge on the River Conwy.",
