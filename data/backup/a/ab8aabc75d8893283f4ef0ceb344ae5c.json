Gorse flowers all year round, although most profusely in spring and the flowers have a distinctive and strong coconut scent. Other common names for gorse are furse, whin and furze. The shrub is a member of the pea family (Fabaceae) and native to western Europe and northwest Africa. It is closely related to the brooms, has green stems with small spiny leaves, and grows in sunny sites on dry, sandy soils."

Cawston heath used to form part of a once huge heath that spread from Horsford to Cromer; originally it supplied wood, heather, furze and turf as well as rabbits for the pot. Much of the woodland in the area was planted on former heath and there is evidence that prior to 1066 the area was covered by forest. Cawston wood and heath once provided grazing for around 1,500 swine and sizeable flocks of sheep and charcoal as well as staves for fencing were produced to meet local needs. Since 1986 the area has been protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the fenced area to the south is in the process of being reverted from arable back to heath land."

  "description": "This circular walk visits the Cawston and Marsham Heaths near Aylsham and Norwich in Norfolk. There's some nice footpaths here, taking you around the heathland and woodland. Look out for pretty heather and birdlife including tree pipits,\u00a0whinchats\u00a0and\u00a0nightjars. You can start your walk from the car park on the southern side of the heath and then pick up the bridle trails and footpaths heading north. The heath lies just a mile or so west from the village of Marsham. To extend the walk head south to Great Wood and the adjacent Buxton Heath where there's more woodland trails and wildlife to see.",
