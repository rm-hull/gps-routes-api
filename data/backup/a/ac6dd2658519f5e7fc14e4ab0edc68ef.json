  "description": "Travel through the beautiful Wiltshire countryside on this lovely walk along a medieval defensive earthwork. The path begins in Marlborough near the famous Marlborough White Horse before passing Savernake Forest, Knapp Hill and Tan Hill and finishing at Morgan's Hill. The walk passes through a mixture of chalk-land and attractive beech woodland at West Woods near Marlborough. There are also a few climbs which offer wonderful views of the surrounding Wiltshire countryside. The route passes close to the Milk Hill summit which is the highest point of Wiltshire. You can take a small detour from the path to reach the summit. Here you can enjoy extensive views to the Mendip Hills, the Cotswolds and in clear weather as far as the Black Mountains in Wales. In this area you will also pass the noteworthy Alton Barnes White Horse figure and the Tan Hill Way which explores several of the hills on the North Wessex Downs range.",
