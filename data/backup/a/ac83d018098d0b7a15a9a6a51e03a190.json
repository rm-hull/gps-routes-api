  "description": "A walk around the beautiful grounds of this Edwardian house at Great Bookham, near Dorking , Surrey. There are over 1400 acres of parkland and gardens to explore with magnificent views of the North Downs hills throughout. The circular walk explores the grounds and skirts the edge of Ranmore Common which lies just to the south of the estate. The expansive common is a great place to extend your walk with miles of footpaths taking you through woodland and open downland, with great views of the Surrey Hills. On the eastern fringe of the estate you will find Denbies Hillside . The National Trust run area includes  waymarked trails, woodland paths and great views of Leith Hill and Dorking from the high points. There's also the Denbies Wine Estate which contains the largest vineyard in England, representing more than 10 per cent of the plantings in the whole of the United Kingdom. Around here you can also pick up the Mole Gap Trail long distance footpath. It's a great way of exploring the Surrey Hills with views of the River Mole along the way.",
