  "description": "This walk from Eyam visits the Swallet Waterfall just to the west of the village. It's a pleasant and secluded little spot and well worth a visit, particularly after wet weather. Start the walk in the village and then follow footpaths round to the Plague Stone just to the north east. You then head north west up to Bole Hill before heading west to follow a path just below Eyam Edge. The path will take you south west to the falls. It's a peaceful area with the 15 metre falls the 2nd highest in the Peak District. The falls are surrounded by woodland and moss covered rocks making it feel like a private and picturesque place. After enjoying the falls the route returns to the village on the same paths. You could though head north west from the falls to visit Bretton or west into Foolow . From here you could turn it into a longer circular walk by following public footpaths east through the countryside.",
