  "description": "This pretty Warwickshire village is a fine place to start a walk. There's riverside trails, canalside paths and some picturesque neighbouring villages to visit in the area. The historic village is also notable as housing the oldest church in Warwickshire and a splendid 17th century half timbered inn. This route uses sections of the Stratford Upon Avon Canal and the Arden Way to create a circular walk around the village. The walk starts on the canal aqueduct, just to the east of the village. From here you can pick up the towpath and follow it south past Austy Wood to Bearley Cross where you will arrive at the noteworthy Edstone Aqueduct . The structure is notable as the longest cast iron aqueduct in England, measuring 475 feet (145 m). You can walk across and enjoy some fine views from the elevated position of the aqueduct. The route continues south to Wilmcote where you'll find Mary Arden's Farm , the farmhouse of Mary Shakespeare (n\u00e9e Arden), the mother of William Shakespeare. The houses and farm are presented as a \"working Tudor farm\" with rare breeds including Tamworth pigs, Cotswold sheep, Longhorn cattle, Bagot and Golden Guernsey goats, geese and birds of prey. The farm gives you a good idea of what life would have been like for the young Mary, working on the farm in the early 16th century. The building is Grade I listed and dates from 1514. The route then follows Wood Lane west to Aston Holdings before turning north along the Arden Way. You can follow the waymarked trail through Aston Cantlow before following the River Alne back into Wootton Wawen.",
