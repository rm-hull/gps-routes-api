  "description": "Follow a series of well laid out footpaths around this lovely nature reserve on this short walk in Sevenoaks. The site covers 71 hectares (175 acres) and includes several lakes, ponds, reedbed and woodlands. The reserve attracts a wide variety of birds including Greylag Goose, Little Ringed Plover, Lapwing, Moorhen, Coot, Great Crested Grebe and Tufted Duck. Waymarked trails take you around the lakes where you can stop and look out for the birds from one of the hides. You can also visit the pretty elemental gardens with wild flowers, orchids and habitats designed to attract various insects and butterflies. There's also a very good visitor centre with a wealth of information and touch tables where you can handle birds nests and birds feathers. If you would like to extend your walk you could head a couple of miles south and visit Knole Park. Here you will find 500 resident deer, ancient woodland, dry heathland, acid grassland and wood pasture. There's another great wildlife watching spot near Sevenoaks at Bough Beech Reservoir. The reserve is located a few miles south of the town and includes nice bluebells woods and lots of birdlife to look out for on the water. Just to the west is Chipstead Lake where there's more nice waterside trails to try.",
