  "description": "This pretty little Wiltshire village is a fine place to start a walk. There's some beautiful views of the Chalke Valley which runs between the historical city of Salisbury and the charming town of Shaftesbury. The village also includes a noteworthy 14th century church and a lovely old pub for refreshments afterwards. This circular walk from the village take you up to Prescombe Down and Sutton Down which stands at a height of 213 metres. Prescombe Down is a national nature reserve with a rich variety of chalk grassland wildflowers. You can also see a wide variety of butterflies here in the summer months. Keep your eyes peeled for fritillary, dark green fritillary, grizzled skipper, dingy skipper and adonis blue as you make your way across the down. The route then heads south across Fifield Down to the settlements of Fifield Bavant where you could take detour east to visit Broad Chalke. This route continues to Bowerchalke before heading north west to return to the village. Along the way there's some splendid views over the countryside of the Cranborne Chase AONB. Eddesbourne Wake is not far from Salisbury where you could enjoy riverside trails and a visit to the famous cathedral.",
