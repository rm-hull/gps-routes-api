  "description": "This challenging circular walk climbs Grasmoor from the Buttermere Valley in the Lake District. The walk begins at the parking area at Lanthwaite at the northern end of Crummock Water. You then climb to Whiteside fell, passing Whin Ben on the way. From the peak of Whiteside there are extensive views of West Cumberland, the Solway Firth and the hills of Scotland. The next section takes you from Whiteside to Hopegill Head along a spectacular ridge with wonderful views of Gasgale Gill. The peak of Hopegill Head is a special place with views of the Isle of Man, the Scottish Border hills and the Helvellyn range. The walk continues to Sand Hill and the 852 m (2,795 ft) Grasmoor summit. From here there are splendid views over the surrounding fells and lakes. The walk then descends to the shores of Crummock Water, passing Lad Hows and Cinderdale Beck and common. The final section then takes you along the lake to the finish point back at the car park.",
