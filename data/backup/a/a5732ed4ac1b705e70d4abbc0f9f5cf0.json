  "description": "This nice circular walk climbs to a prominent hill on the Somerset Levels. The route runs for just over 3 miles, providing fine views to the coast. There's also a visit to the two villages at the foot of the hill which both have interesting old churches to see. The walk starts at the village of Brent Knoll which lies a short distance to the west of Brent Knoll hill. From here you can pick up footpaths heading north east to the 137\u00a0m (449\u00a0ft) summit of the hill. \u00a0Here you will find the noteworthy Brent Knoll Camp an\u00a0Iron Age\u00a0hill fort, with multiple ramparts (multivallate) following the contours of the hill, broken only by the main entrance on the eastern side. It has been designated as a\u00a0Scheduled Ancient Monument\u00a0and is now in the care of the\u00a0National Trust. There are great views over Burnham on Sea and Brean to enjoy from here too. After exploring the hill top the route descends north to the village of East Brent. Here you can visit the interesting 15th century church which is Grade I listed. It's also a good place to stop for refreshments at what is roughly the half way point on the walk. The Brent Knoll Inn has a good menu and a lovely beer garden to relax in. You can find it just to the east of the village at postcode TA9 4JG. After exploring East Brent the route then picks up footpaths on the northern side of the hill. These bend round to the west to return you to the finish point back in the village. To continue your hill climbing in the Somerset Levels head north east to Compton Bishop and try the climb to Crook Peak . The hill is also located very close to Burnham-on-Sea. Here you can enjoy some lovely coastal walks at Brean Down and the Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve .",
