  "description": "This attractive town sits at the mouth of the River Dee in Dumfries and Galloway. It's a fine place to visit with river trails, boat trips, art galleries, museums and lots of historic buildings to see. This walk from Kirkcudbright takes you along the riverside path to Tongland. It's a pleasant surfaced path with good views of the surrounding countryside and the Tongland Power station towards the end of the route. The trail runs for just over 2 miles so around 4.5 miles there and back. To continue your walking in the area head north east to visit Castle Douglas. Here you can enjoy a walk around the lovely Threave Gardens and Carlingwark Loch . To the east is Dalbeattie where you can explore the peaceful woodland trails at Dalbeattie Forest . There's a pretty loch, mountain bike trails and red squirrels to look out for here.",
