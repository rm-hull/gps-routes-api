The 140 yard long tunnel was constructed simply so as not to conflict with the driveway to Calke Abbey, and is of cut-and-cover build. This is the eastern tunnel mouth. The strengthening arches visible inside are under the driveway itself so as to be able to cater for modern vehicles. The tunnel is a Scheduled Monument. It has been restored to form part of an extended cycle and pedestrian route along the tramway."

  "description": "This walk explores the old Ticknall to Ashby tramway in Calke Abbey, Derbyshire. The industrial tramway connected the brickyards, lime quarries and lime yards of Ticknall to the Ashby Canal. The horse drawn system operated from 1802 to 1913. Today part of the route makes for a nice leisurely walk or cycle. Start the walk in Ticknall and then head south west from the town along the trail and you will soon come to the tunnel. You'll then pass some farms and woodland before coming to Southwood. Here you turn north east to follow other trails through Calke Park. The site has an interesting history having been an Augustinian priory from the 12th century until its dissolution by Henry VIII. There's some splendid architecture and lovely gardens to enjoy here. The final section of the walk takes you through some woodland before returning to the village. There's good options nearby for extending your walk if you have time. Staunton Harold Reservoir and Foremark Reservoir are located either side of the trail. There are some nice waterside trails and woodland footpaths to explore here.",
