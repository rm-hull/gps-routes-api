  "description": "A circular walk from Woldingham train station taking you into the Surrey Hills AONB. The route runs for about 5 miles, exploring the countryside and woods to the south of the village. Start the walk from Woldingham train station. You can catch trains from London Victoria to the village in about 30 minutes. From here you pick up footpaths heading south through the Marden Park estate. The estate was established in the 17th century by Sir Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor of London. The house, rebuilt in the 1880s, became the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic boarding school, now known as Woldingham School. Continue south through the estate and eventually you will meet with the North Downs Way. Follow the trail east and it will take you through some nice woodland to Gangers Hill. The trail then turns north to  Great Church Wood before returning to the train station. To extend the walk head a short distance north Warlingham where you could pay a visit to the Blanchman's Farm Local Nature Reserve . The reserve includes a nature trail, two summer meadows, a pond, a central wooded area,\u00a0hazel coppice, a newly planted orchard and horse grazing. It's a nice place to look out for wildlife in the local area.",
