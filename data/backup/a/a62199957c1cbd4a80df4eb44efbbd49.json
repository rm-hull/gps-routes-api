  "description": "A circular walk from Woldingham train station taking you into the Surrey Hills AONB. The route runs for about 5 miles, exploring the countryside and woods to the south of the village. Start the walk from Woldingham train station. You can catch trains from London Victoria to the village in about 30 minutes. From here you pick up footpaths heading south through the Marden Park estate. The estate was established in the 17th century by Sir Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor of London. The house, rebuilt in the 1880s, became the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic boarding school, now known as Woldingham School. Continue south through the estate and eventually you will meet with the North Downs Way. Follow the trail east and it will take you through some nice woodland to Gangers Hill. The trail then turns north to Great Church Wood before returning to the train station. To extend the walk head a short distance north Warlingham where you could pay a visit to the Blanchman's Farm Local Nature Reserve. The reserve includes a nature trail, two summer meadows, a pond, a central wooded area, hazel coppice, a newly planted orchard and horse grazing. It's a nice place to look out for wildlife in the local area.",

This pub/restaurant is set in a 16th century farmhouse on the Titsey Estate at the highest point of the North Downs Way. The gardens and grounds are lovely with fine views over the surrounding area. There's also a nice little tea room on the site if you fancy a slice of cake and cup of tea. It's also home to a gift shop, which has homewares, gift ideas and local food and drink. You can find them on Limpsfield Road with a postcode of CR6 9QH for your sat navs. The Botley Hill Walk can also be started from here."

You can extend your walking in the area by heading either west or east along the waymarked path. Near here you could also pick up the Greensand Way and head south east to visit Limpsfield Common. There's some nice trails and carpets of bluebells in the spring months to be found here. Head west and you can pick up the Coulsdon South Circular Walk and explore the popular Farthing Downs, Happy Valley Park and Coulsdon Common."
