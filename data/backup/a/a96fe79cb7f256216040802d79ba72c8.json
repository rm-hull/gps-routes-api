The Red Bandits of Mawddwy were a band of red-haired robbers, highwaymen from the area of Mawddwy in Mid Wales in the 16th century, who became famous in folk literature. It has been variously known as the Peniarth Arms (early C20), the Bury Hotel (1920's) and more recently the Brigands Inn in memory of the notorious bandits, Gwylliaid Cochion Mawddwy."

  "description": "This little Welsh village is located just south of Dinas Mawddwy in the Dovey/Dyfi Valley of Snowdonia. There's some fine riverside trails, excellent views of the surrounding Cambrian mountains and an historic pub dating back several hundred years. This walk from the village takes you through the valley to Dinas Mawddwy, passing the old Packhorse Bridge at Minllyn on the way. There's lovely views of the lush countryside of the valley and a visit to a photogenic ancient bridge. You'll also pass Meirion Mill with its shop and old Mawddwy Railway building. To continue your walking in the area head south west of the village to explore the expansive Dyfi Forest. There's miles of walking and mountain bike trails to enjoy here.",
