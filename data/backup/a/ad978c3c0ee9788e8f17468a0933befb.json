  "description": "Visit this spectacularly positioned lighthouse and the wonderful South Stack Cliffs RSPB nature reserve on this walk in Holyhead, Anglesey. The walk starts from the car park a short distance from the lighthouse. You then descend 400 steps on to the island. It's a short but wonderful path with craggy cliffs and wonderful coastal views to enjoy as you descend. On a clear day you can see to the Isle of Man and the mountains of Ireland. After climbing back up the steps you can explore the South Stack Cliffs nature reserve on more splendid coastal paths. The reserve consists of heathland with wildflowers and an abundance of wildlife. Look out for coastal birds including Chough, Guillemot and Puffins. You may also see porpoises in the water below. Please note that although this is a short walk the climb back up the steps is quite challenging so you need to be in reasonable shape! To extend your walk you can easily pick up the Anglesey Coast Path and follow it along South Stack Road to Penrhosfeilw. In the other direction you will find Holyhead Mountain and Breakwater Country Park. Here you can enjoy a nature trail and wonderful views of the Irish Sea and the Skerries. The google street view link below will give you a great panoramic view of the area from the car park.",

      "content": "Near to the car park you will find the interesting Ty Mawr Hut Circles. Also known as Cytiau'r Gwyddelod or the Irishmen's Huts, they are the remains of a group of prehistoric huts and one of the best-preserved hut groups in Wales. The settlement is to the southeast of the South Stack Lighthouse, on the opposite side of the road from the small car park provided by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It's well worth a visit if you have time after visiting the lighthouse."
