  "description": "These splendid RHS Gardens in Surrey have a number of lovely, well laid out footpaths to follow. Wisley is second only to Kew Gardens on the list of the most visited paid entry gardens in the country.  There's lots to see in the park with water features including pretty ponds with fountains and a canal with water lilies. Other highlights include Battleston Hill with its woodland garden, rhododendrons and azaleas. The seven acres garden has a Chinese Pagoda, specimen trees, wide lawns and two ponds. Also visit the huge glasshouse with a plant collection in three climatic zones: dry temperate, moist temperate and tropical. If you'd like to continue your walking in the area then you could head to Painshill Park. It's located just a couple of miles away, on the other side of Wisley common, and has miles of waterside and woodland walking trails to try. Also nearby are Wisley and Ockham Common where you will find 800 acres of woodland and heathland to explore.",
