It was once a test of manhood for young men (girlhood in this case!), living in nearby villages. They had to climb the rock before they could marry. Be warned, it is not as easy as the photograph suggests, as each layer overhangs the next and the young lady in the photograph had some help getting to the point shown!"

  "description": "A circular walk up to Baslow Edge in the Peak District National Park. The route runs for about 2 miles with a moderate climb on the way. From the elevated position of the Edge there are fine views over the countryside to Chatsworth Park. You'll also pass some interesting gritstone rock formations and a monument to a famous figure from British history. You can start the walk from the public car park just to the east of Curbar and just north of Baslow Edge. From here you can pick up trails heading south up to the Edge. Here you'll pass the noteworthy Eagle Stone which people like to climb up for better views and a wee challenge. Also near here is Wellington's Monument. The stone cross is dedicated to the Duke of Wellington and a celebration of his victory at the battle of Waterloo. After rounding the stone and monument the route follows alternative trails back to the car park.",
