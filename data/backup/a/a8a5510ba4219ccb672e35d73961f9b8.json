      "caption": "Waternish Point lighthouse. Vaternish Lighthouse was originally built in 1924 by the notable lighthouse engineers David and Charles Stevenson, who contributed to many lighthouses across Scotland. The original lens from this lighthouse has since been donated to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, where it remains on display. In 1980, a new tower was constructed by engineer John Smith, incorporating a concrete base, an aluminium light room, and a glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) roof. The lighthouse became even more modernized in 2001, when solar panels were installed to power its light, reducing the need for manual maintenance. The lighthouse's history reflects the evolving nature of lighthouse technology in the 20th century, transitioning from traditional engineering to more modern materials and sustainable energy sources."

      "caption": "Ruined Church and Cemetery at Trumpan. The medieval ruin holds a somber place in Scottish history due to the infamous 1578 massacre that occurred there. The attack, led by Clan Macdonald (Clan Ranald) of South Uist, was a retaliatory strike against Clan MacLeod, who had killed hundreds of Macdonalds on the Isle of Eigg the year before. During the attack, the Macdonalds set fire to the church while the MacLeods were attending a service, killing many. The incident is sometimes referred to as the \"Battle of the Spoiling Dyke,\" named after the dyke where the few MacLeods who escaped the fire sought refuge. The church, now in ruins, still contains late medieval carved gravestones, and the surrounding burial ground is significant as well. It was designated a scheduled monument by Historic Environment Scotland in 1936 due to its historical and archaeological importance. This tragic event highlights the deep-seated clan rivalries in Scottish history and serves as a haunting reminder of the violence that often accompanied these conflicts."

  "description": "This circular walk visits the beautiful Waternish peninsula on the Isle of Skye. You can start the walk from the car park at the hamlet of Trumpan in the north west of the island. Here you will find an ancient ruined church and a footpath heading north towards Waternish Point. There is a steep cliff, a rocky beach and a lighthouse here. The walk then heads along the coast path taking you around the headland before turning south west to climb towards Beinn a' Ghobhainn. You'll enjoy some fine views over the island from this elevated spot before descending back to the car park. To continue your walking in the area head south along the coast to visit Neist Point, the most westerly point on the Duirinish peninsula. The historic Dunvegan Castle and Gardens can also be found in this area.",
