  "description": "The pretty village of Fulking sits in a lovely position on the South Downs. In the village there's picturesque cottages and a natural spring and fountain which was installed in 1886. Henry Willett, a wealthy brewer from Brighton, and the famous painter and art critic John Ruskin are usually credited with devising and instigating the water supply scheme. This circular walk from the village visits one of the highlights of the area at the Devils Dyke. Here you'll find a photogenic dry valley with an Iron Age Hill Fort and stunning views across the South Downs. The walk starts from the village and follows public paths and a section of The South Downs Way to the Devil's Dyke, passing Fulking Hill on the way. The route explores the site before returning to the village on alternative paths. You can take a slight detour from the route to visit the village of Poynings if you have time.",
