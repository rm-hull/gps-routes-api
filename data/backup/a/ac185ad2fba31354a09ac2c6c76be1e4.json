  "description": "This small Cumbrian village sits in a quiet rural spot in the valley of the River Lyvennet. This walk from the village takes you along the river visiting the picturesque ford and the photogenic Jackdaw's Scar. The impressive limestone outcrop lies just to the west of the village and is a popular place for rock climbers. You'll continue along the pretty river to the old mill before heading across the countryside to visit the neighbouring village of Morland. The village lies just to the west of Appleby in Westmorland where you can enjoy a lovely walk along the River Eden and visit the secluded Rutter Force Waterfall. You can also pick up the long distance Dales High Way here. Just to the north west there's the Whinfell Forest where there's miles of good woodland walking trails to try. To the west is the Lake District where you can visit the beautiful Ullswater Lake and the historic Askham Hall .",
