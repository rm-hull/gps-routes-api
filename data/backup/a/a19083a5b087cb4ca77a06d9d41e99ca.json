  "description": "Enjoy a peaceful stroll around these beautiful gardens in Minstead in the New Forest. There are well laid out footpaths taking you through the gardens with Azaleas, Rhododendrons and woodland glades. Other highlights include the delightful 16th Century Cottage which you can explore, and a tranquil lake with a variety of plants and flowers around its borders. There are also viewpoints with views towards the Isle of Wight and New Forest. The Minstead Walk visits the gardens from the nearby village. It then goes on to visit the historic Rufus Stone just to the north east of the gardens.",
