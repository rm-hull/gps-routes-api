  "description": "This Denbighshire village is in a good spot for exploring the Clwydian Range AONB. This circular walk from the village climbs to the Moel-y-Gaer Hill fort which stands on a hill to the north of the settlement. You can follow a section of the Offa's Dyke Path up to the hill where there are some fine views of the valley of the River Wheeler. The Iron Age fort stands at a height of 200 m (656 ft) making it one of the smaller forts in the Clwydian Range. To continue your walking in the area follow the Offa's Dyke Path south to climb to Penycloddiau and Moel Arthur where there's some lovely heather and more great views. The Clwydian Way also passes through the area and is a great way of exploring the mountains.",
