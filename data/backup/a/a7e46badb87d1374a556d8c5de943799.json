  "description": "This walk follows a section of the South West Coast Path from Penzance to Mousehole via Newlyn. The walk starts at the harbour in Penzance, next to the train station and parking area. Head south past the Docks and South Pier where you can catch a ferry to the Isle of Scilly. You round Battery Rocks and continue along the path towards Newlyn, passing Wherrytown and Bolitho Gardens on the way. Newlyn lies on the shore of Mount's Bay with plenty of yachts, fishing boats and pleasure boats to see in the harbour. The town also includes an art gallery and a good selection of pubs and restaurants. The route continues past the lighthouse to Penlee Point before coming into Mousehole. The little fishing village is very picturesque with its lovely harbour and sandy beach. There's also galleries, gift shops, cafes and pubs where you can refresh yourself after your walk. To extend the walk continue along the coastal path to Porthcurno where you can visit the Minack Theatre. The wonderful open air theatre is positioned above a gully with a rocky granite outcrop jutting into the sea. From here you can try our Porthcurno to Land's End Walk which takes you to the most westerly point of England. Near Penzance you can also visit Trengwainton Gardens where you can follow footpaths to a series of beautiful walled gardens, tranquil ponds and lawns. You could also pick up the St Michaels Way and head to Marazion where you can visit the wonderful St Michael's Mount.",

      "content": "The next stage on the coastal path is the Mousehole to Lamorna Walk. This will take you south to the Kemyel Point Nature Reserve and the lovely Lamorna Cove. The secluded cove includes a pebble beach, a quay and a harbour. There's also Lamorna village where there's an intriguing old smugglers pub to investigate. Just west of Penzance you can pick up the inland Drift Reservoir Walk and follow the waterside path before visiting the adjacent Trewidden Gardens. For more walking ideas in the area see the Cornwall Walks page."
