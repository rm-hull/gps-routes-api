  "description": "This attractive West Northamptonshire village is a lovely place to start a walk. The settlement is located very close to a scenic river and canal with a water based nature reserve also within walking distance of the village centre. This circular walk from the village visits the Oxford Canal and the River Cherwell before heading to the neighbouring settlements of Bodicote and Adderbury where you'll visit the pretty Adderbury Lakes. The walk starts in the village centre and heads north west to meet up with the canal. Follow the canal north and it will take you towards Warkworth, Banbury and the point where the canal meets with the Jurassic Way long distance footpath. Here you leave the canal and head west towards Bodicote. Follow paths south through the village and you will pass the windmill before coming to nearby Adderbury. Just east of here you can visit the Adderbury Lakes Nature Reserve where there's lots of water loving wildlife to look out for. After exploring the reserve you head east through Twyford to return to the canal. You can then follow this south back towards Kings Sutton.",

This visits some of the local highlights including Bodicote Lake, the restored 19th century windmill, the 13th century church and the Georgian Bodicote House. There's also an 18th century pub to visit in the pretty village afterwards. Also nearby there's neighbouring Aynho where you can explore the 17th century Aynho Park Estate. There's also a fine canalside pub to visit in this area. For more walking ideas in the area see the Oxfordshire Walks and the Northamptonshire Walks pages."
