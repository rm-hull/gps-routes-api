  "description": "This exceptionally lovely walk takes you through the beautiful Shropshire and Herefordshire countryside, from Ludlow to Kington . The walk begins at the splendid, medieval Ludlow Castle in Shropshire and heads towards Aymestrey, crossing the River Teme before passing through Mortimer Forest , Haye Park Wood and Deer Park. This section passes the excellent viewpoint at High Vinnalls and visits the British Iron Age hill fort at Croft Ambrey , where there are more fabulous views of the Herefordshire countryside. You can also explore the beautiful gardens surrounding the historic Croft Castle here. At Aymestrey you join the River Lugg for a delightful waterside stretch that leads to Shobdon Hill Wood. The path continues to Byton and then onto Wapley Hill Iron Age Fort, with the final stretch taking you to the finish point at Kington. This is a challenging walk with several steep climbs but with the reward of spectacular views of the area.",
