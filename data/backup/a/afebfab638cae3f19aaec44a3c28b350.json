The limestone was dragged down the slope and loaded onto boats and taken across the Severn estuary to Devon."

  "description": "This circular walk explores the area around the National Trust's Pwll Du Bay on the Gower Peninsula. The beautiful bay and beach are regarded as something of a Gower hidden gem. There is no immediate parking so it's a peaceful and secluded spot to visit. The route starts at the Southgate National Trust car park just west of the bay. You can then follow footpaths east along the coast to Pwll Du Head and then on to the beach at Pwll Du Bay. There's some steps down to the beach which means 'Black Pool' in English. The route then heads through the delightful Bishopston Valley where you can enjoy some shady woodland trails, river paths and secret little caves. The route then heads west from here through Lockway Wood to return to the car park.",
