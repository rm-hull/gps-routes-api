  "description": "Follow the River Stour from its source near Lenham to the estuary at Pegwell Bay on the Kent coast. You will pass through a varied landscape of downland, woodland, orchards, farmland, lakes, dykes and marshland. The route also passes through many of Kent's finest unspoilt villages, hamlets and historic towns. The walk beings at the village of Lenham and heads towards Ashford via Little Chart, Great Chart and Pluckley . From Ashford you turn north towards historic Canterbury with its magnificent cathedral. This section takes you through the delightful village of Chilham which includes a pretty lake with a beautiful 5-storey watermill and an inhabited Norman Keep thought to be one of the oldest dwellings in the UK. The next section then leads to Sandwich passing the attractive Westbere Lakes and Stodmarsh National Nature Reserve as you go. The final section then takes you from Sandwich to the delightful Pegwell Bay on the Stour Estuary.",
