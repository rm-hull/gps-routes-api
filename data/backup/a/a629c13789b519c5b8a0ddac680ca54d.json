  "description": "Enjoy a walk along the River Gipping on this walk from Stowmarket to Needham Market. The walk runs for about 4 miles along a flat, waymarked path known as the Gipping Valley River Path . As such it's ideal for an afternoon stroll. The walk starts on the river in Stowmarket, just to the west of the train station. You then follow the footpath south east past Creeting St Peter and Badley Mill Farm to Needham Market where you finish at the train station. At the end of the walk you can catch the train directly back to Stowmarket or follow the same path back. You could also turn it into a circular walk by following a series of public footpaths through the countryside to the west of the towns. These pass Little London and Combe Wood and give nice views of the Suffolk countryside. To extend the walk continue south to Needham Lake . The lake has a nice circular footpath to follow around the perimeter. It's a pretty spot and includes a variety of wildlife to look out for on the water. Classed as a nature reserve there are also wetland areas, meadows and a small woodland.",
