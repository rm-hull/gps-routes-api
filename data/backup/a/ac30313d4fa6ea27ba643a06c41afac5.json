  "description": "Explore open grassland, woodland and glade in this country park in Nottingham. In the park you will find peaceful woodland walking trails, an ornamental pond and the Burntstump Inn where you can enjoy refreshments. The pub overlooks the cricket field so it's a nice place to relax on match days. The Robin Hood Way long distance walking trail runs through the park so there is the option of continuing your day out with a walk through Sherwood Forest. You could follow the trail to Hucknall's Bestwood Country Park where you will find 650 acres of parkland and lakes. Just to the north is Blidworth Woods where there's some nice trails taking you through pine woodland and open heath. If you head a couple of miles north west along the Robin Hood Way you will soon come to Newstead Abbey. This former Augustinian priory was also home to Lord Byron. The house is surrounded by acres of parkland, woodland, formal gardens and lakes. Burntstump park is located close to both Nottingham and Mansfied.",
