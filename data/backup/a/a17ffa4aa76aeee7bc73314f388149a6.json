  "description": "Climb to the peak of the highest mountain on the Isle of Man on this short climb from the Bungalow station. It's about a one mile climb from the station which is on the excellent Snaefell Mountain Railway. Catch the railway from the town of Laxey then alight at Bungalow to climb the rest of the way. You can also drive to the Bungalow car park and start the walk from there. The trail has sections of gravel, slate stones, grass and rock. It's a short path but quite steep near the summit. From the 2,037 feet (620.9 m) high summit it is said you can see the six kingdoms of the Isle of Man, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Heaven. A plaque points out the directions of landmarks and their distances from the summit. At Laxey you can pick up the Isle of Man Coastal Path to extend your walk.",
