  "description": "This walk visits Barna Woods in the coastal village of Barna in Galway. The mixed broadleaf woodland is a popular place for a walk with miles of trails taking you through the attractive woodland. On the way there's streams, little bridges and lots of woodland birds to look out for. On the coastal (southern) side of the woods you can also enjoy some lovely views over the picturesque Rusheen Bay. Also to the south is the pretty Silverstrand beach, another nice place for a stroll in the area. To continue your walking around Barna head east to visit Galway and enjoy a riverside walk along the River Corrib Walk.",
