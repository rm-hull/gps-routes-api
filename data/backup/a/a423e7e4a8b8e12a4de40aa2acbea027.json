  "description": "Explore 220 acres of woodland, meadows and coast in this super country park near Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan. The route starts at the car park on the coast and takes you along the pretty pebble beach before turning inland into the woodland on nature trails. You will pass through the pretty grassland with its wildflower meadow and calming stream. You will also pass Viaduct wood with super views of the impressive Porthkerry Viaduct. The route below is designed for walkers but a nice easy cycle track runs through the centre of the park just up from the coast. It makes for a nice, safe ride for families. Facilities in the park include an excellent cafe, chidlren's play area and a 12 hole golf course.",
