  "description": "The historic market town of West Malling is located in the\u00a0Tonbridge and Malling\u00a0district of\u00a0Kent, a few miles west of Maidstone. The area is surrounded by pleasant countryside with a local country park and Mereworth Woods just to the south west. This circular walk from the train station takes you to Manor Park Country Park and the historic St Leonard's Tower . The walk starts from the train station and heads south west through the countryside to Manor Park. This attractive park has good footpaths taking you to  fields, wildflower meadows and a lake with lots of wildlife to look out for on the water. After passing west through the park you will soon come to St Leonard's Tower. The 11th century tower is located on a natural sandstone ledge near the head of a narrow valley.\u00a0The tower was probably built by\u00a0Gundulf, the\u00a0Bishop of Rochester, between 1077 and 1108. After passing the tower you loop round to enter the town. Here you'll find a Georgian High Street with an 18th-century coaching inn (Grade II listed), and Went House, which was built in 1720 and is noted for its elegant brickwork. After passing through the town the route soon returns to the train station.",
