It features a combination of walled and woodland gardens, lochs, and Victorian glasshouses. The gardens offer seasonal variation, with displays such as snowdrops and bluebells in the spring, and a range of autumn colours. The woodland areas are particularly vibrant in late spring and early summer, when rhododendrons bloom alongside bluebells and other wild plants, while exotic species thrive in the glasshouses during autumn.\nVisitors can explore the Walled Garden via wide gravel paths and lawns, where mature shrubs and various plants are on display. A highlight is the 19th-century glasshouses, showcasing fruits such as peaches, nectarines, and grapes, alongside other exotic plants. The estate also contains a hedge maze, noted for being the first of its kind planted in south-west Scotland. Additionally, there is a tearoom at the garden entrance offering food and drinks, and a shop selling plants."
