  "description": "The walk starts in Starcross on the banks of the River Exe Estuary and heads past the 14th century Powderham Castle and then along the Exeter Canal to Exeter. The next section continues along the River Exe to Tiverton via Thorverton and Bickleigh. The final section takes you from Tiverton into the Exmoor National Park where you will pass through Dulverton and Hawkridge before the finish at Exford in Somerset. This section passes close to the old clapper bridge at Tarr Steps near Dulverton and Withypool. It's well worth a short detour if you have time. Around here you'll also cross the picturesque five arched Landacre Bridge over the River Barle. The route finishes near Dawlish Warren where there is a lovely nature reserve with lots of waders to look out for. You can also pick up the Dawlish Sea Wall and enjoy a stroll along the train line, beach and red sandstone cliffs to nearby Dawlish.",
