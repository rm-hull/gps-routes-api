  "description": "Climb this hill in Greater Manchester for great views over Ashton-under-Lyne, Mossley and Oldham. At the summit you will find the 19th century Hartshead Pike Tower, a Grade II Listed building. From the 267 m (876 ft) summit you can enjoy views over the Pennine Hills, the city of Manchester and even Snowdonia in Wales on a clear day. The circular walk starts near Mossley train station and climbs past Luzley Brows and Luzley Hall to Mossley Cross. You continue to Hartshead Pike before descending back to the town via Broad Carr. If you would like to continue your walking in the area then you could pick up the Oldham Way which runs past Hartshead Pike. You could also pick up the Tame Valley Way and enjoy a walk along the River Tame through Mossley. You can also pick up the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and head across the Pennines and the Peak District towards Huddersfield.",
