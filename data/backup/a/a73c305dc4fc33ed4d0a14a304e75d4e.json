It reflects the Roman influence on the area, not least in the nearby Fishbourne Roman palace."

  "description": "This pleasant short route follows the Centurion Way along a disused railway path from Chichester to West Dean. The ride is flat and traffic free making it ideal for cycling families or walkers looking for a pleasant easy stroll through the Sussex countryside. Starting just west of the town centre the route heads north to Mid Lavant before finishing at West Dean. It runs for a distance of just over 5 miles. You could turn it into a longer circular walk by picking up the Monarch's Way at West Dean and heading south east to climb The Trundle in Goodwood Country Park. There's some excellent views over the area from this elevated spot. From here you would then head south west along Chalkpit Lane to East Lavant before coming to the outskirts of Chichester. The trail is coincident with the long distance New Lipchis Way which you can use to extend the walk.",
