  "description": "This Wiltshire based village is located in a lovely spot in the valley of the River Nadder. There's also some good trails through the surrounding countryside of the West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The historic village is very pleasant for a stroll with quaint old cottages, a 12th century parish church, an ancient yew and a Grade I listed Tithe Barn to see. This circular walk around Tisbury takes you to one of the highlights of the area at Old Wardour Castle. You'll also visit the village of Donhead St Andrew and explore the woodland, ponds and parkland of the expansive Wardour Park. The walk starts in the village car park, next to the River Nadder. You could also start from the train station which is close by. The route then heads south into the countryside around Wallmead Farm, following a bridleway towards the old castle. The 14th century castle is managed by English Heritage who provide an audio tour where you can learn about the castle's history. There are fine views over the surrounding Wiltshire countryside from the top of the castle. You then head west along the Wessex Ridgeway passing the castle lake and a series of pretty ponds before stopping off at Donhead St Andrew where refreshments are available at the Forester Inn. The trail then heads north east along the Nadder towards West Hatch before heading east to the site of the mediaval village of Wyck. From here it is a short walk back into Tisbury.",
