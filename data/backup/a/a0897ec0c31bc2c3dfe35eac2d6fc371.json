  "description": "This market town in South Gloucestershire is surrounded by some lovely Cotswolds countryside. Several waymarked trails run through the town providing the opportunity of exploring the area on well maintained walking paths. The town itself is very pleasant for a stroll with a series of 17th century stone cottages on the attractive Broad Street. This route follows sections of the Monarch's Way , the Cotswold Way and the Frome Valley Walkway to create a circular walk around the town. On the way you'll visit the little neighbouring villages of Little Sodbury and Old Sodbury. There's also some nice waterside trails along the River Frome and an old Fort to see on the way. The walk starts in the town centre where you can pick up the Monarch's Way and follow the waymarked footpath north east along the Frome and out into the countryside. The trail will take you to Winchcombe Farm before coming to Little Sodbury. This interesting village includes the 15th century manor house which once played host to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. The trail turns south from the village to pass Little Sodbury Wood and the Iron Age Hillfort before coming to Old Sodbury. There's a picturesque church dating from the 12th century here which is well worth investigating. There's also some nice views from the elevated position of the fort. At Old Sodbury you pick up the Frome Valley Walkway and follow the waymarked trail west along the river. It will lead you back into Chipping Sodbury where the route finishes.",
