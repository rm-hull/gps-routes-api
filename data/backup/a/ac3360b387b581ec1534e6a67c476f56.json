  "description": "The expansive area of woodland surrounding the Angmering Park Estate has miles of public bridleways and footpaths for walkers and cyclists to try. As well as the sheltered paths through the pretty woods there are some nice open fields and good views across the surrounding countryside to enjoy. The area is particularly magical in the spring when there are carpets of bluebells to see. The woods are located just to the east of Arundel. You could reach the site by following the Monarch's Way along the river and then east to the woods. This route, however, starts from The Dover car park north of Angmering, near Hammerpot. From here you head north west along the trail to Wepham Wood. Here you pick up a section of the waymarked Monarch's Way long distance trail, heading east to Michelgrove Park. You then turn south through Patching Rough woods, before passing through Surgeon's Fields and the Hammerpot Copse to return to the car park. To extend your walk you can head west along the Monarch's Way and visit Arundel Castle and Arundel Park. Here you'll find more nice woodland trails and footpaths around Swanbourne Lake and along the River Arun. Also nearby is the wonderful Slindon Estate with miles of trails to try.",

      "content": "In Arundel head to the St Mary\u2019s Gate Inn. The pub has a fascinating history having been built in the 26th year of the reign of Henry VIII in 1525. The two other letting rooms which have been part of the building since the 16th century housed Oliver Cromwell and his guardsmen during the mid-1600. The pub has a great menu, good selection of ales and a cosy log fire. You can find it near the castle on London Rd at Postcode BN18 9BA.The Red Lion on the High Street is another great option. This one dates back to the 18th century and includes a large beer garden to relax in. You can find it at postcode BN18 9AG."

      "content": "The estate is located just a few miles north west of the seaside town of Worthing. Here you can pick up the circular Worthing Walk. It visits the Iron Age fort at Cissbury Ring before heading across the South Downs to the 11th century ruins of Bramber Castle. Just to the north west is the worthy village of Burpham to visit. The delightful riverside settlement includes picturesque thatched cottages, a Grade I listed Saxon Church and a century-old cricket pitch where W. G. Grace played. Just to the south is the nearby town of Littlehampton. The town is well worth a visit with its two award winning beaches, some fine architecture and the longest bench in Britain to see.  For more walking ideas in the area see the Sussex Walks and South Downs Walks pages."
