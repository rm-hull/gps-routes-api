  "description": "The expansive area of woodland surrounding the Angmering Park Estate has miles of public bridleways and footpaths for walkers and cyclists to try. As well as the sheltered paths through the pretty woods there are some nice open fields and good views across the surrounding countryside to enjoy. The area is particularly magical in the spring when there are carpets of bluebells to see. The woods are located just to the east of Arundel. You could reach the site by following the Monarch's Way along the river and then east to the woods. This route, however, starts from The Dover car park north of Angmering, near Hammerpot. From here you head north west along the trail to Wepham Wood. Here you pick up a section of the waymarked Monarch's Way long distance trail, heading east to Michelgrove Park. You then turn south through Patching Rough woods, before passing through Surgeon's Fields and the Hammerpot Copse to return to the car park. To extend your walk you can head west along the Monarch's Way and visit Arundel Castle and Arundel Park. Here you'll find more nice woodland trails and footpaths around Swanbourne Lake and along the River Arun. Also nearby is the wonderful Slindon Estate with miles of trails to try.",
